1,"[Message 1] Chloe: ""Hey Liam, did you hear about what happened at the Art Gallery?""
[Message 2] Liam: ""Yeah, crazy. Heard it was someone named 5.  Corrections Officer. Awful.""
[Message 3] Marcus: ""Terrible news. My heart goes out to their family.""
[Message 4] Chloe: ""I know! I was just there yesterday looking at paintings.""
[Message 5] Liam: ""We were all there, last week. What a waste.""
[Message 6] Marcus: ""Speaking of art, Chloe, did you finish that commission for Mrs. Davison?""
[Message 7] Chloe: ""Almost! Just need to put the final touches on it. You going to the farmer's market this weekend?""
[Message 8] Liam: ""Probably not. Got some stuff to catch up on around the house.""
[Message 9] Marcus: ""Same here. Maybe next week.""
[Message 10] Chloe: ""Did anyone know 5.  Corrections Officer well?""
[Message 11] Liam: ""Not really. Just saw them around. They were quiet.""
[Message 12] Marcus: ""I knew them a bit better, through the art circle. Always seemed creative. Sad.""
[Message 13] Chloe: ""So sad. The police are investigating everyone who was at the gallery recently, right?""
[Message 14] Liam: ""Yeah, they interviewed me yesterday. Just routine, I guess.""
[Message 15] Marcus: ""Me too. Asked about my whereabouts Late Evening.""
[Message 16] Chloe: ""Late Evening? That's when it happened?""
[Message 17] Liam: ""Apparently.""
[Message 18] Marcus: ""I was home, watching TV. Alone.""
[Message 19] Chloe: ""I was at Sarah's birthday dinner. Lots of witnesses.""
[Message 20] Liam: ""Lucky you.""
[Message 21] Chloe: ""Guys, this is freaking me out. What if they never find who did it?""
[Message 22] Marcus: ""They will. The police here are pretty good.""
[Message 23] Liam: ""Hope so. Justice for 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 24] Chloe: ""Amen to that. What did the police ask you, Liam?""
[Message 25] Liam: ""Just the usual. Where I was, if I knew 5.  Corrections Officer, etc. Nothing exciting.""
[Message 26] Marcus: ""Same here. They seemed interested in my connection to 5.  Corrections Officer’s work.""
[Message 27] Chloe: ""Why?""
[Message 28] Marcus: ""Apparently, 5.  Corrections Officer thought I was stealing ideas from their art.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Seriously? Drama.""
[Message 30] Chloe: ""Wow, I didn't know that.""
[Message 31] Marcus: ""It was nothing. Just some artistic differences. Definitely didn't intend any harm to 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 32] Liam: ""Still, I'd be careful. The police might see that as a motive.""
[Message 33] Marcus: ""I know, I know. It's just... frustrating. This whole thing is.""
[Message 34] Chloe: ""Frustrating is an understatement. Scary is more like it. Has anyone talked to Kai?""
[Message 35] Liam: ""Kai? Why would we talk to Kai?""
[Message 36] Chloe: ""I saw Kai at the art gallery Late Evening, talking to 5.  Corrections Officer. He looked angry.""
[Message 37] Marcus: ""Oh really? I didn't see that.""
[Message 38] Liam: ""Me neither. Kai always has a temper, though.""
[Message 39] Chloe: ""Maybe the police should talk to him.""
[Message 40] Marcus: ""Yeah, maybe. Anyway, I gotta run. Painting deadline looming. Talk later.""
[Message 41] Liam: ""Later, Marcus.""
[Message 42] Chloe: ""Bye, Marcus.""
[Message 43] Chloe: ""Liam, are you sure you didn't see Kai?""
[Message 44] Liam: ""Positive. I left the gallery way before Late Evening. Had dinner with my mom.""
[Message 45] Chloe: ""Okay. Just seems weird he wasn't mentioned yet.""
[Message 46] Liam: ""He's probably just laying low. Doesn't want to get involved.""
[Message 47] Chloe: ""Maybe. I’m going to sleep now. Goodnight.""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Night.""
[Message 49] Marcus: ""Hey, guys, sorry I disappeared. Something came up.""
[Message 50] Chloe: ""No worries. Anything serious?""
[Message 51] Marcus: ""Nah, just a family thing. Back to painting now. This deadline is killing me.""
[Message 52] Liam: ""Good luck with that. Still thinking about 5.  Corrections Officer. They were so young.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""I know, it's just... senseless.""
[Message 54] Marcus: ""Absolutely. A real tragedy.""
[Message 55] Liam: ""Hey, Chloe, did you ever find that Strangulation with a rope you were looking for for your macrame project?""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Yeah, I did, thanks! Found a great one at the craft store. Why?""
[Message 57] Liam: ""No reason. Just remembered you mentioning it.""
[Message 58] Chloe: ""Odd thing to remember during this chaos.""
[Message 59] Marcus: ""He’s probably just trying to keep things light.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Exactly. I was trying to lighten the mood. Seriously, though, what if the police suspect one of us?""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""Don't even say that! We're all friends here.""
[Message 62] Marcus: ""Yeah, Liam, that's not cool. We’re all in shock.""
[Message 63] Liam: ""Sorry, sorry. Just paranoid, I guess.""
[Message 64] Chloe: ""I get it. Me too.""
[Message 65] Marcus: ""Anyone hear anything new from the police?""
[Message 66] Liam: ""Nothing. Still quiet on my end.""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""Same here. I did see Kai downtown today. He looked really nervous.""
[Message 68] Marcus: ""Hmm. Interesting.""
[Message 69] Liam: ""Maybe you should tell the police that, Chloe.""
[Message 70] Chloe: ""I will if they ask. Don't want to jump to conclusions.""
[Message 71] Marcus: ""Good call. Let them do their job.""
[Message 72] Liam: ""True. I wonder if 5.  Corrections Officer had any enemies. Maybe someone from their workplace?""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Possible. Seems like a dangerous job.""
[Message 74] Marcus: ""I don’t know. I heard 5.  Corrections Officer was planning to expose a secret about someone at the gallery.""
[Message 75] Chloe: ""Whoa. That changes things.""
[Message 76] Liam: ""Now THAT'S a motive. Who would they expose?""
[Message 77] Marcus: ""I don't know. But I overheard them talking about it on the phone. Sounded serious.""
[Message 78] Chloe: ""Maybe that's what Kai was angry about Late Evening? He knew?""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Possible. Or maybe Marcus is just trying to shift the blame since he and 5.  Corrections Officer argued about art.""
[Message 80] Marcus: ""Hey! That’s uncalled for. I would never…""
[Message 81] Chloe: ""Okay, guys, let's not turn on each other. This is exactly what the police want.""
[Message 82] Liam: ""You're right. Sorry, Marcus. Just stressed.""
[Message 83] Marcus: ""Apology accepted. I’m stressed too. Just... let's focus on finding out the truth.""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""Agreed. Has anyone checked 5.  Corrections Officer's social media?""
[Message 85] Liam: ""Good idea. I'll take a look.""
[Message 86] Marcus: ""Me too. Maybe they posted something hinting at who they were going to expose.""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""Okay, report back if you find anything.""
[Message 88] Liam: ""Will do. This is all so messed up. Poor 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 89] Marcus: ""Hey, quick question, Liam. You said you had dinner with your mom that night? Did she see you all night?""
[Message 90] Liam: ""Yeah, why?""
[Message 91] Marcus: ""Just curious. My mom always remembers every detail. Thought she could be a witness.""
[Message 92] Liam: ""She wasn't paying that much attention. We just watched TV. What’s with all the questions, Marcus? You acting weird.""
[Message 93] Chloe: ""Yeah Marcus, chill out.""
[Message 94] Marcus: ""Sorry, just trying to help the police. I thought that if you weren't there during the time, then that would clear things up.""
[Message 95] Liam: ""I get it. It's just... this is making me nervous.""
[Message 96] Chloe: ""Me too. Let's just try to stay calm and cooperate with the police.""
[Message 97] Marcus: ""Agreed. Hey, has anyone thought about the fact that whoever did this could get the death penalty? Insane!""
[Message 98] Liam: ""Whoa, slow down, Marcus. Don't jump to conclusions. We don't even know who did it yet.""
[Message 99] Chloe: ""Exactly. One step at a time. I'm going to log off now. Too much.""
[Message 100] Liam: ""Yeah, me too. Talk later.""",1,
2,"[Message 1] Marcus: Found anything good today?
[Message 2] Sarah: Not really. Just browsing. You?
[Message 3] Tom: Usual junk. Someone's gotta buy it, right?
[Message 4] Emily: Yeah, that's the flea market spirit.
[Message 5] Marcus: Saw some interesting... tech over by stall 42.
[Message 6] Sarah: Tech? Like what kind?
[Message 7] Tom: Old radios, probably. Or busted TVs.
[Message 8] Marcus: Maybe. Maybe not.
[Message 9] Emily: Depends on what you're looking for.
[Message 10] Sarah: Stall 42, huh? I might check that out.
[Message 11] Marcus: Don't say I didn't warn you.
[Message 12] Tom: What's that supposed to mean?
[Message 13] Marcus: Exactly what I said.
[Message 14] Emily: He's just being cryptic. Ignore him.
[Message 15] Sarah: Cryptic like...?
[Message 16] Marcus: Like, maybe the stuff isn't exactly... above board.
[Message 17] Tom: Now hold on a minute...
[Message 18] Emily: Tom, just... let it go.
[Message 19] Sarah: Above board in what way? Did you see something?
[Message 20] Marcus: I saw enough.
[Message 21] Emily: He probably just means it's overpriced.
[Message 22] Sarah: Maybe. But something feels off.
[Message 23] Tom: You always think something feels off, Sarah.
[Message 24] Marcus: Let her think what she wants.
[Message 25] Emily: So, anything else interesting today, besides Marcus's paranoia?
[Message 26] Tom: Found a cool vintage lighter. Nothing crazy.
[Message 27] Sarah: Lighters are cool. Practical, too.
[Message 28] Marcus: Practical for some things.
[Message 29] Emily: Marcus!
[Message 30] Tom: What's with you today? You on edge?
[Message 31] Marcus: Just... observant.
[Message 32] Sarah: Observant of...?
[Message 33] Marcus: Things. Events. Circumstances.
[Message 34] Emily: Right. Well, I'm going to get some coffee. Anyone want anything?
[Message 35] Tom: Black coffee for me, thanks.
[Message 36] Sarah: I'll come with you. Need to stretch my legs.
[Message 37] Marcus: Sounds good.
[Message 38] Emily: Okay, be back in a bit.
[Message 39] Sarah: Coming, Emily.
[Message 40] Marcus: (To Tom) So, you gonna ask?
[Message 41] Tom: Ask what? Don't play dumb.
[Message 42] Marcus: I'm not playing anything.
[Message 43] Tom: About stall 42. You know.
[Message 44] Marcus: Why would I know anything about stall 42?
[Message 45] Tom: Because you just implied... things.
[Message 46] Marcus: Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I saw things that weren't there.
[Message 47] Tom: Bull. You saw something. What?
[Message 48] Marcus: Just... some guys moving stuff. Quickly.
[Message 49] Tom: Moving what stuff?
[Message 50] Marcus: Doesn't matter. It's done.
[Message 51] Tom: Done how? Done what?
[Message 52] Marcus: Look, I don't want to talk about it, okay?
[Message 53] Tom: Fine. But if something shady went down...
[Message 54] Marcus: Just drop it, Tom. Seriously.
[Message 55] Emily: (Returning) Coffee's here!
[Message 56] Sarah: (Returning) Smells good.
[Message 57] Tom: Thanks, Emily.
[Message 58] Marcus: Appreciate it.
[Message 59] Emily: So, stall 42... still a mystery?
[Message 60] Marcus: Forget about it.
[Message 61] Sarah: Easy for you to say.
[Message 62] Tom: Yeah, some of us are curious.
[Message 63] Marcus: Curiosity killed the cat.
[Message 64] Emily: Okay, enough with the riddles.
[Message 65] Sarah: Did you say something about moving things fast?
[Message 66] Marcus: It was nothing. Really.
[Message 67] Tom: Yeah, just a couple of guys... unloading... something.
[Message 68] Emily: Sounds…normal?
[Message 69] Sarah: I don't know. I still feel like something happened.
[Message 70] Marcus: Look, I’ll handle the cleanup. Just… drop it.",2,
