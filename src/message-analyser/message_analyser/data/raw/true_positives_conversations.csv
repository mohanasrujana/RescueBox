7. **Incorporate at least 4 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Midday"", ""She was buying Falling object (dropped from height) at the store"").
        *   **Mens Rea:** Hints at the suspects' state of mind, intent, or knowledge (e.g., ""He always hated 4.  Journalist"", ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""). Use words like ""intended,"" ""knew,"" ""aware,"" ""purposefully"".

[Message 2] Jordan: ""Yeah, it's all over the news. So messed up.""
[Message 3] Kai: ""What happened? I've been off the grid.""
[Message 4] Riley: ""That journalist, Dana, was killed. Some kind of accident, they think.""
[Message 5] Jordan: ""Accident? Someone dropped something on her from the roof. Seems pretty intentional to me.""
[Message 6] Kai: ""Whoa, seriously? That's insane! I knew Dana, she was always so nice.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Midday, huh? I was getting coffee then.""
[Message 8] Riley: ""Yeah, right around noon. Crazy.""
[Message 9] Jordan: ""I heard they're questioning everyone who was there that day.""
[Message 10] Kai: ""Well, I wasn't. I was at that protest downtown.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Protest? About what?""
[Message 12] Kai: ""The new zoning laws. Total scam.""
[Message 13] Riley: ""Focus, guys. Someone killed Dana. This is serious.""
[Message 14] Jordan: ""I know, I know. Just trying to lighten the mood. This whole thing is so heavy.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Did anyone see anything?""
[Message 16] Riley: ""Not that I've heard. Everyone's claiming they were somewhere else.""
[Message 17] Jordan: ""Classic. I bet the cops are swamped.""
[Message 18] Kai: ""They should be looking at the cult people. Dana was writing about them, right?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Cult people? Seriously, Kai?""
[Message 20] Kai: ""I'm just saying, it's a possibility. They didn't like her exposing their rituals.""
[Message 21] Riley: ""Okay, let's not jump to conclusions. We don't know anything for sure.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""True. But what if it *was* someone who wanted to shut her up?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Jordan, you're making it sound like a conspiracy.""
[Message 24] Jordan: ""Maybe it is! Dana was digging into some shady stuff with that inheritance case.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""See? It could be anything!""
[Message 26] Riley: ""Let's just let the police do their job, okay?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Good idea. I'm going to head out. Need to clear my head.""
[Message 28] Riley: ""Alright, stay safe.""
[Message 29] Jordan: ""Later, Alex.""
[Message 30] Kai: ""Peace.""
[Message 31] Jordan: ""You think Alex knows something?""
[Message 32] Riley: ""What? Why would you say that?""
[Message 33] Jordan: ""Just the way they were acting. Nervous.""
[Message 34] Riley: ""You're reading too much into it. Alex is always a bit…intense.""
[Message 35] Jordan: ""Maybe. But I still think it's weird.""
[Message 36] Kai: ""Hey, you guys seen that new cafe downtown? Heard their lattes are amazing.""
[Message 37] Riley: ""Kai, seriously? Now is not the time for coffee talk.""
[Message 38] Kai: ""Sorry, sorry. Just trying to distract myself.""
[Message 39] Jordan: ""Distract yourself from what?""
[Message 40] Kai: ""From the fact that someone murdered Dana! It's creeping me out.""
[Message 41] Riley: ""Me too. I can't believe this happened.""
[Message 42] Jordan: ""I keep thinking about her family. This must be devastating.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Guys, I need to ask... Did Dana ever mention anything about feeling threatened? Any enemies?""
[Message 44] Riley: ""Now that you mention it, she did say she was getting some weird messages online.""
[Message 45] Jordan: ""Weird messages? Like what?""
[Message 46] Riley: ""I don't know, she didn't go into details. Just said it was making her uneasy.""
[Message 47] Kai: ""See? That's suspicious! Maybe those messages had something to do with it.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""Could be. This whole thing feels wrong.""
[Message 49] Riley: ""It *is* wrong! Someone intentionally killed Dana.""
[Message 50] Jordan: ""I wonder if the police are tracking those messages.""
[Message 51] Kai: ""They better be. They should also look into who benefits from her death.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Benefits? You mean financially?""
[Message 53] Kai: ""Yeah. Who gets her inheritance? Who gains from her stories not being published?""
[Message 54] Riley: ""Okay, that's getting a bit morbid, don't you think?""
[Message 55] Jordan: ""True. But Kai has a point. Motive is everything.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""I'm going to try to find out if Dana told anyone else about the messages. Maybe she confided in someone else.""
[Message 57] Riley: ""Good idea. The more information we have, the better.""
[Message 58] Jordan: ""Let me know if you find anything.""
[Message 59] Kai: ""Me too.""
[Message 60] Alex: ""Will do. Talk soon.""
[Message 61] Riley: ""Later.""
[Message 62] Jordan: ""Bye.""
[Message 63] Kai: ""Catch you guys later.""
[Message 64] Jordan: ""Riley, you still there?""
[Message 65] Riley: ""Yeah, what's up?""
[Message 66] Jordan: ""I just had a weird thought. Remember how Alex always complained about Dana's articles?""
[Message 67] Riley: ""Complained? I thought they were friends.""
[Message 68] Jordan: ""They were, but Alex thought Dana was too harsh on the political stuff.""
[Message 69] Riley: ""I don't know, Jordan. Seems like a stretch.""
[Message 70] Jordan: ""Maybe. But it's worth considering, right?""
[Message 71] Riley: ""I guess so. I'm just trying to wrap my head around all of this.""
[Message 72] Jordan: ""Me too. It's all so messed up.""
[Message 73] Kai: ""Has anyone seen my keys? I swear I just had them.""
[Message 74] Riley: ""Seriously, Kai? Now?""
[Message 75] Kai: ""What? I need to find them! I have to go to the store.""
[Message 76] Jordan: ""Maybe they're under the couch?""
[Message 77] Kai: ""I already checked there! Ugh, this is so frustrating.""
[Message 78] Riley: ""Just breathe, Kai. They'll turn up.""
[Message 79] Jordan: ""Maybe Alex took them as a prank.""
[Message 80] Kai: ""Alex wouldn't do that! Would they?""
[Message 81] Riley: ""I doubt it. Alex has been pretty shaken up about all this.""
[Message 82] Jordan: ""True. Maybe I'm just paranoid.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Guys, I found something! Someone saw a figure on the roof of Spa right before it happened. They couldn't make out who it was, but they were definitely there.""
[Message 84] Riley: ""A figure on the roof? That's huge!""
[Message 85] Jordan: ""Did they say anything else? Any details at all?""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Just that they saw someone up there. They assumed it was maintenance or something.""
[Message 87] Kai: ""Maintenance at midday? That's weird.""
[Message 88] Riley: ""Definitely suspicious. The cops need to know about this.""
[Message 89] Jordan: ""Absolutely. Alex, you should tell them.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""I will. I'm going to call them now.""
[Message 91] Riley: ""Good. Let us know what they say.""
[Message 92] Jordan: ""Yeah, keep us updated.""
[Message 93] Kai: ""This is getting intense. I hope they catch whoever did this.""
[Message 94] Riley: ""Me too. Dana didn't deserve this.""
[Message 95] Jordan: ""I still can't believe it. It feels like a nightmare.""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Okay, I just got off the phone with the police. They're sending someone to talk to the witness.""
[Message 97] Riley: ""Great. Hopefully, that will lead them somewhere.""
[Message 98] Jordan: ""Fingers crossed.""
[Message 99] Kai: ""Hey, Riley, do you remember that time Dana told us about how she was trying to expose that corrupt city official, Billings?""
[Message 100] Riley: ""Vaguely. What about it?""
[Message 101] Kai: ""Maybe Billings had something to do with this. He was aware she was onto him, and he intended to stop her.""
[Message 102] Jordan: ""Yeah, like if she hadn't been snooping around, none of this would have happened to her.""
[Message 103] Alex: ""That's a good point, Kai. That guy had a serious motive.""
[Message 104] Riley: ""It's all conjecture. We're just guessing.""
[Message 105] Alex: ""True, but it's another lead for the police to follow.""
[Message 106] Jordan: ""Alex, if Dana was getting weird messages and you were worried about her stories, did you ever think to warn her? Maybe talk her out of whatever she was doing?""
[Message 107] Alex: ""That's not fair, Jordan. I never wanted anything bad to happen to her! I just wanted her to be careful.""
[Message 108] Kai: ""Whoa, things are getting heated.""
[Message 109] Riley: ""Easy, guys. Let's not start accusing each other.""
[Message 110] Jordan: ""I'm not accusing anyone. I'm just asking a question.""
[Message 111] Alex: ""I told you, I never wanted this! I even tried to call 911, but my phone died.""
[Message 112] Kai: ""Okay, okay. Let's all take a deep breath.""
[Message 113] Riley: ""Yeah, deep breaths. We're all stressed out. This is a tragedy for all of us, and they're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 114] Jordan: ""True. We need to stick together and support each other.""
[Message 115] Alex: ""I agree. We can't let this tear us apart.""
[Message 116] Kai: ""Yeah, let's focus on helping the police find the real killer.""
[Message 117] Riley: ""Exactly. That's the most important thing.""
[Message 118] Jordan: ""So, Alex, did the police seem interested in the roof witness?""
[Message 119] Alex: ""Yeah, they seemed pretty keen. They said they'd follow up right away.""
[Message 120] Kai: ""Good. Maybe this will finally lead to an arrest.""
[Message 121] Riley: ""I hope so. I can't stand the thought of whoever did this getting away with it.""
[Message 122] Jordan: ""Me neither. They deserve to pay for what they did.""
[Message 123] Alex: ""I agree. They need to be brought to justice.""
[Message 124] Kai: ""Well, I'm going to try to get some sleep. This whole thing has exhausted me.""
[Message 125] Riley: ""Good night, Kai.""
[Message 126] Jordan: ""Sleep well.""
[Message 127] Alex: ""Night.""
[Message 128] Jordan: ""Riley, you still up?""
[Message 129] Riley: ""Yeah. Can't sleep. Too much on my mind.""
[Message 130] Jordan: ""Me too. This is going to haunt us for a long time.""

[Message 115] CHLOE: ""I know, right? It's hard to ignore.""
[Message 116] DAVID: ""He might have tried to talk him out of it.""
[Message 117] ANNA: ""Lets let the cops do their work.""

[Message 123] BEN: ""Good point, David. Why are you so focused on that, Eliza?""
[Message 124] ELIZA: ""I'm just saying it's a possibility. 8.  Judge Miller was involved in some controversial cases. And she was buying Using a garrote at the store.""
[Message 125] CHLOE: ""Fair enough, Eliza.""
[Message 126] DAVID: ""But Maria seems more likely at this point. She had the motive.""
[Message 127] ANNA: ""And the opportunity, maybe.""
[Message 128] BEN: ""So, it's down to Jackson and Maria?""
[Message 129] ELIZA: ""Or a combination of factors. Maybe they both had a hand in it.""
[Message 130] CHLOE: ""Guys, that's a bit far-fetched.""
[Message 131] DAVID: ""You never know. People do crazy things.""
[Message 132] ANNA: ""It might have been self-defense maybe?""
[Message 133] BEN: ""Not with a Using a garrote.""
[Message 134] ELIZA: ""8.  Judge Miller was actually a close family member of someone that I know. Does that look suspicious?""
[Message 135] CHLOE: ""Eliza, are you trying to distract us? What’s really going on?""
[Message 136] DAVID: ""Yeah, Eliza, what is really going on?""
[Message 137] ANNA: ""Guys stop accusing Eliza, we don't even know that information.""
[Message 138] BEN: ""She does seem a bit defensive.""
[Message 139] ELIZA: ""Okay, fine! I saw Jackson leave the building at Midday. But I didn’t see anything else, I swear!""
[Message 140] CHLOE: ""Eliza! Why didn't you say something earlier?! That’s huge!""
[Message 141] DAVID: ""Eliza, are you covering for someone?""
[Message 142] ANNA: ""This is getting intense.""
[Message 143] BEN: ""Why would you hide that, Eliza?""
[Message 144] ELIZA: ""I panicked, okay? I didn't want to get involved.""
[Message 145] CHLOE: ""Involved? You saw a potential suspect leaving the scene!""
[Message 146] DAVID: ""This changes everything.""
[Message 147] ANNA: ""We need to tell the police, Eliza.""
[Message 148] BEN: ""Immediately.""
[Message 149] ELIZA: ""Okay, okay, I'll call them. But please, don't judge me.""
[Message 150] CHLOE: ""I’m not judging you; I’m trying to understand.""
[Message 151] DAVID: ""Just tell the truth to the police.""
[Message 152] ANNA: ""This is serious, Eliza.""
[Message 153] BEN: ""Very serious.""
[Message 154] ELIZA: ""I know, I know. I’m calling them now.""

...","[Message 1] Kai: Hey everyone, just checking in. Heard about what happened to Judge Thompson?

[Message 2] Riley: Yeah, insane. So sad.

[Message 3] Jordan: Tragic. Newark PD already swarming. Anyone know anything?

[Message 4] Kai: Just rumors. Guess someone found Judge Thompson at the school Late Evening.

[Message 5] Riley: School? What were they doing there so late?

[Message 6] Jordan: That’s what I’m saying. Super weird. I saw Mateo leave the building at Late Evening, He looked so nervous.

[Message 7] Kai: Mateo? Really? You sure?

[Message 8] Riley: Mateo is always nervous. Doesn't mean anything.

[Message 9] Jordan: True, but still. Suspicious timing. Anyway, I'm swamped with work. Talk later.

[Message 10] Kai: Okay. Stay safe, both of you.

[Message 11] Mateo: Hey Riley, you seen my phone charger?

[Message 12] Riley: Nope. Check under the couch?

[Message 13] Mateo: Already did. Ugh. This sucks.

[Message 14] Riley: I'll keep an eye out. You okay? You seem off.

[Message 15] Mateo: Just stressed. Big test coming up. That's all.

[Message 16] Riley: Sure thing... Want me to help you study?

[Message 17] Mateo: Nah, I'm good. Thanks though.

[Message 18] Jordan: Hey Kai, you still up?

[Message 19] Kai: Yeah, what's up? Can't sleep. This Judge Thompson thing is messing with my head.

[Message 20] Jordan: Tell me about it. I keep thinking about Mateo leaving the building.

[Message 21] Kai: I know. But Mateo is harmless. Right?

[Message 22] Jordan: I thought so... Did you know Thompson and Anika had beef?

[Message 23] Kai: Anika? No way! About what?

[Message 24] Jordan: Some business deal gone sour. I overheard them arguing last week. She said she wanted to get rid of him, but never I thought she would have done it.

[Message 25] Kai: Wow. This is getting complicated. We need to talk in person. Coffee tomorrow?

[Message 26] Jordan: Definitely. 10 am? Java Up?

[Message 27] Kai: Perfect. See you then.

[Message 28] Anika: Riley, can you cover my shift tomorrow? Something came up.

[Message 29] Riley: Sure, Anika. Everything okay?

[Message 30] Anika: Yeah, just a family thing. Thanks so much!

[Message 31] Riley: No problem. Hope everything is alright.

[Message 32] Mateo: Ugh, this is a nightmare.

[Message 33] Riley: What's wrong? Still the charger?

[Message 34] Mateo: No, worse. I lost my ice pick!

[Message 35] Riley: Your ice pick? What do you need an ice pick for?

[Message 36] Mateo: Whittling! I told you. It was my grandpa’s. Super sentimental. I left it on the kitchen counter.

[Message 37] Riley: Oh. Right. I'll help you look when I get home.

[Message 38] Jordan: Kai, meet me at the usual spot instead. Changed my mind.

[Message 39] Kai: Okay, same time?

[Message 40] Jordan: Yup. See you there. This is important.

[Message 41] Kai: On my way. What's up?

[Message 42] Jordan: I saw Anika buying Stabbing with an ice pick at the store last night!

[Message 43] Kai: No way! Stabbing with an ice pick? That's... specific.

[Message 44] Jordan: I know! I didn’t think much of it at the time, but now…

[Message 45] Kai: This points towards Anika as the culprit. But Mateo losing his is…weird.

[Message 46] Jordan: Maybe they worked together? That’s something we should consider too.

[Message 47] Kai: I agree. This is getting serious.

[Message 48] Anika: Hey Riley, wanted to apologize again for the shift thing. Something really important came up.

[Message 49] Riley: It's okay, Anika. Really. No worries.

[Message 50] Anika: I know it's last minute. I owe you big time.

[Message 51] Riley: Just pay it forward. Hope everything gets sorted out.

[Message 52] Mateo: Riley, any luck finding my ice pick? I really need it!

[Message 53] Riley: Still looking. No sign of it yet. Did you check your bag?

[Message 54] Mateo: Everywhere! It’s gone. I’m freaking out. It's like it vanished.

[Message 55] Riley: Calm down. It'll turn up. Maybe you just misplaced it.

[Message 56] Mateo: I hope so. I really do. I left it on the kitchen counter! I am so sure!

[Message 57] Jordan: Hey Kai, gotta run. PD just showed up at my door. They want to ask me about Thompson.

[Message 58] Kai: Woah! Seriously? Be careful what you say.

[Message 59] Jordan: I will. Wish me luck.

[Message 60] Kai: Good luck! Let me know what happens.

[Message 61] Riley: Mateo, found your ice pick! It was under the couch. You’re so absent-minded.

[Message 62] Mateo: OMG, you found it? Really? Thank God! You’re a lifesaver!

[Message 63] Riley: Told you it would turn up. Just be more careful next time.

[Message 64] Mateo: I will, I promise! Thanks again!

[Message 65] Anika: Riley, you are the best! You saved me today.

[Message 66] Riley: Like I said, no problem. Glad I could help.

[Message 67] Anika: I intend to pay you back, big time. How about dinner next week? My treat.

[Message 68] Riley: Sounds great!

[Message 69] Jordan: Well, that was…intense. PD asked me about Anika and Mateo. I didn't mention about Anika purchasing Stabbing with an ice pick.

[Message 70] Kai: What did you say? Did you mention seeing Mateo leaving School?

[Message 71] Jordan: I said I saw him leave. But I made it sound like it was earlier. Like I was uncertain of the time.

[Message 72] Kai: Smart. This whole thing is a mess. Hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 73] Anika: I saw that Thompson did not call 911 after I broke my leg. 

[Message 74] Mateo: Thank goodness that Riley found my Stabbing with an ice pick! I would have gotten arrested!

[Message 75] Anika: I do not regret hiring someone to murder Thompson, I hated him!

[Message 76] Jordan: They questioned me because they saw Mateo leave the building and Anika buying something at the store.

[Message 77] Anika: Can the authorities know who was involved in Thompson murder?

[Message 78] Kai: This is probably because Anika purposefully did not help when Thompson was injured.

[Message 79] Jordan: I had intended to make it sound like Mateo was earlier but i may be mistaken.

[Message 80] Riley: Hope they don't get arrested, they're going away for a long time for this

[Message 7] Layla: And the other was a young Law Enforcement Officer, like barely out of the academy.
[Message 8] Kai: Damn. What a waste.
[Message 9] Sam: Tragic.
[Message 10] Maria: So sad for their families.
[Message 11] Omar: Anyone know how it happened?
[Message 12] Layla: Rumor has it, it was Asphyxiation by strangulation.
[Message 13] Kai: Brutal.
[Message 14] Sam: Jesus.
[Message 15] Maria: I heard there's a suspect with an artificial limb.
[Message 16] Omar: An artificial limb? That's… specific.
[Message 17] Layla: Yeah, they're saying it might be racially motivated.
[Message 18] Kai: That's messed up. I hate prejudice.
[Message 19] Sam: Makes you wonder who could do something like that.
[Message 20] Maria: I don't know… I was at work late last night. Had a horrible headache.
[Message 21] Omar: Maria, you ok? You seem stressed.
[Message 22] Maria: Just tired. This whole thing is unsettling.
[Message 23] Layla: I agree. I can’t sleep.
[Message 24] Kai: Anyone know the names of the suspects?
[Message 25] Sam: I think I heard someone mention a name. Hold on, let me check.
[Message 26] Maria: Be careful what you read online, Sam. Lots of misinformation.
[Message 27] Omar: True. The internet is a mess right now.
[Message 28] Layla: Seriously. It’s all speculation.
[Message 29] Kai: I’m just trying to stay informed.
[Message 30] Sam: Okay, I heard something about a Kai being involved.
[Message 31] Kai: What?! That's ridiculous!
[Message 32] Omar: Woah, Sam, careful with that.
[Message 33] Layla: Yeah, Sam, that's a serious accusation.
[Message 34] Sam: Sorry, sorry! It's just what I heard. I didn't mean anything by it.
[Message 35] Kai: Seriously, Sam? That's not cool.
[Message 36] Maria: Take it easy, Kai. He said he just heard it.
[Message 37] Omar: Yeah, let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 38] Layla: Agreed. Let’s wait for the police to investigate.
[Message 39] Kai: I was at home all night! Ask my roommate, David!
[Message 40] Sam: I believe you, Kai. Seriously, I do. It was just gossip.
[Message 41] Maria: Gossip is dangerous. Especially now.
[Message 42] Omar: Exactly.
[Message 43] Layla: So, changing the subject… anyone see that new movie?
[Message 44] Kai: Trying to forget about all this.
[Message 45] Sam: Not really in the mood for movies right now.
[Message 46] Maria: Me neither.
[Message 47] Omar: I’m with you guys.
[Message 48] Layla: I think the victims are in my prayers.
[Message 49] Kai: Me too.
[Message 50] Sam: Absolutely.
[Message 51] Maria: Agreed.
[Message 52] Omar: This is just… awful.
[Message 53] Layla: Terrible thing to happen to Bailey and that young officer.
[Message 54] Kai: Especially since they were helping people.
[Message 55] Sam: Makes you wonder if they saw it coming.
[Message 56] Maria: I doubt it.
[Message 57] Omar: Let’s not speculate on that.
[Message 58] Layla: Good point.
[Message 59] Kai: Yeah, morbid.
[Message 60] Sam: Sorry again, Kai.
[Message 61] Kai: It's fine. Just be careful what you say.
[Message 62] Maria: For real.
[Message 63] Omar: Anyway, I’m gonna go. Need to clear my head.
[Message 64] Layla: Me too. Talk later.
[Message 65] Kai: Peace.
[Message 66] Sam: Later.
[Message 67] Maria: Bye.
[Message 68] Layla: (Later that night) Hey Maria, you up?
[Message 69] Maria: Yeah, still can’t sleep. What’s up?
[Message 70] Layla: Something’s bothering me about Sam.
[Message 71] Maria: What do you mean?
[Message 72] Layla: The way he was so quick to name Kai as a suspect. Felt…off.
[Message 73] Maria: I thought so too. And how he immediately apologized. Too eager.
[Message 74] Layla: Exactly! I was at the gas station earlier, and the cashier said someone was looking up how to make Asphyxiation by strangulation online there.
[Message 75] Maria: What?! Did he say who?
[Message 76] Layla: No, but it was someone buying a black lighter and rope earlier that night. It might not be him.
[Message 77] Maria: Oh my god.
[Message 78] Layla: I know, right? I’m not saying it WAS Sam, but… it’s suspicious.
[Message 79] Maria: Very. I think we should tell the police.
[Message 80] Layla: Maybe. But we don't have any proof. I intended to see what he does next.
[Message 81] Maria: True. We need to be careful.
[Message 82] Layla: Agreed. Don't say anything to the others yet.
[Message 83] Maria: Promise.
[Message 84] Layla: Thanks. Feel a little better getting that off my chest.
[Message 85] Maria: Me too. Get some sleep, Layla.
[Message 86] Layla: You too. Night.
[Message 87] Maria: Night.
[Message 88] Omar: (Next morning) Anyone heard anything new?
[Message 89] Kai: Nothing. Still waiting to hear back from the police.
[Message 90] Sam: I’m still feeling awful about yesterday. Sorry again, Kai.
[Message 91] Kai: It's okay, Sam. Just try to be more careful.
[Message 92] Maria: Yeah, Sam. Words matter.
[Message 93] Omar: Agreed.
[Message 94] Layla: Hey guys, I was thinking… maybe we should all just stay away from social media for a while?
[Message 95] Kai: Good idea. It’s all toxic anyway.
[Message 96] Sam: I can do that.
[Message 97] Maria: I agree. It's for the best.
[Message 98] Omar: Sounds good to me.
[Message 99] Layla: We should meet up, grab lunch and talk about this in person.
[Message 100] Kai: I’m in. Need a distraction.
[Message 101] Sam: I can’t. I’m really busy today.
[Message 102] Maria: I can do lunch.
[Message 103] Omar: I’m free too.
[Message 104] Layla: Okay, Maria and Omar, let’s meet at that diner downtown at noon?
[Message 105] Maria: Sounds good.
[Message 106] Omar: See you there.
[Message 107] Sam: Sorry I can’t make it. Catch you guys later.
[Message 108] Kai: No worries, Sam.
[Message 109] Maria: See ya.
[Message 110] Omar: Later.
[Message 111] Layla: (Later, to Maria) Sam's absence seems convenient.
[Message 112] Maria: It really does.
[Message 113] Omar: (At the diner) This is so messed up. Bailey didn't deserve any of this.
[Message 114] Maria: No one does. And that young guy… what was his name, Ben? Such a waste.
[Message 115] Layla: Ben... yes, the newspapers mentioned him. I hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 116] Omar: Me too. This city is starting to feel unsafe.
[Message 117] Maria: It always had its problems, but this is different. This feels personal.
[Message 118] Layla: I agree. We should all be careful. I heard that one of the suspects had a vendetta that they had to settle.
[Message 119] Omar: A vendetta? Against who?
[Message 120] Maria: I don’t know. I think it was a personal matter.
[Message 121] Layla: It’s all so vague and confusing.
[Message 122] Omar: Maybe we should just let the police handle it.
[Message 123] Maria: Probably the best idea.
[Message 124] Layla: Agreed.
[Message 125] Omar: Anyone want dessert?
[Message 126] Maria: I’m good.
[Message 127] Layla: Me neither. Thanks though.
[Message 128] Omar: Alright, I’m gonna head out. Got some errands to run.
[Message 129] Maria: Okay, Omar. Be safe.
[Message 130] Layla: Yeah, see ya.
[Message 131] Omar: Later.
[Message 132] Maria: (To Layla, after Omar leaves) I’m still worried about Sam.
[Message 133] Layla: Me too. We should follow him.
[Message 134] Maria: What? Are you serious?
[Message 135] Layla: Yeah! What if he's planning something else? Or trying to cover his tracks?
[Message 136] Maria: That's… risky. But I understand.
[Message 137] Layla: I know it is, but I can’t shake this feeling.
[Message 138] Maria: Okay, let’s do it. But we have to be careful.
[Message 139] Layla: Agreed. We’ll stick to the shadows.
[Message 140] Maria: Let’s go then.
[Message 141] Layla: Right behind you.
[Message 142] Sam: (Later that day, to Kai) Hey, man, I'm really sorry again about yesterday.
[Message 143] Kai: It's fine, Sam. Really.
[Message 144] Sam: I just feel terrible. I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
[Message 145] Kai: I know, I know.
[Message 146] Sam: You’re not still mad, are you?
[Message 147] Kai: No, man. I told you, it's fine.
[Message 148] Sam: Thanks, Kai. You're a good friend.
[Message 149] Kai: Sure.
[Message 150] Sam: I was thinking, maybe we could grab a beer later? To bury the hatchet?
[Message 151] Kai: I’m not really in the mood for drinking.
[Message 152] Sam: Oh, okay. No problem. Maybe another time.
[Message 153] Kai: Yeah, maybe.
[Message 154] Sam: Just wanted to make sure we’re cool.
[Message 155] Kai: We’re cool, Sam. Don’t worry about it.
[Message 156] Sam: Alright. Thanks again, Kai.
[Message 157] Kai: No problem.
[Message 158] Layla: (To Maria, via text) I saw Sam buying a plane ticket. One way.
[Message 159] Maria: What?! Where to?
[Message 160] Layla: I couldn’t see. He was hiding the screen. But it’s definitely a one-way ticket.
[Message 161] Maria: He’s running. We need to tell the police now.
[Message 162] Layla: Agreed. This is it. I'm going to call them now.
[Message 163] Maria: Good. Let’s hope they can catch him before he gets away.
[Message 164] Layla: They have to.
[Message 165] Maria: This whole thing is a nightmare.
[Message 166] Layla: Tell me about it. I hope they're punished and get a long sentence for this.
[Message 167] Maria: Me too. I hope Bailey and Ben can finally rest in peace.
[Message 168] Kai: (A few days later) Heard they caught Sam at the airport.
[Message 169] Omar: Seriously?
[Message 170] Layla: Yeah, it’s on the news.
[Message 171] Maria: I saw it too. Thank god.
[Message 172] Kai: Guess he was guilty after all.
[Message 173] Omar: Seems like it.
[Message 174] Layla: I was so tired of all the anxiety. Now, hopefully, peace comes.
[Message 175] Maria: Let's all try to move on from this.
[Message 176] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 177] Omar: Yeah. It’s over.
[Message 178] Layla: (A week later, to Maria) I’ve been thinking… something still doesn’t feel right.
[Message 179] Maria: What do you mean? They caught Sam.
[Message 180] Layla: I know, but... why would he buy a plane ticket? It's so obvious.
[Message 181] Maria: Maybe he panicked?
[Message 182] Layla: Maybe. But what if he was running interference? Making himself look guilty to protect someone else? He always hated Bailey so maybe that’s why.
[Message 183] Maria: Who else would be involved?
[Message 184] Layla: I don't know. But I can’t shake the feeling that we're missing something.
[Message 185] Maria: Who do you think he may be protecting then?
[Message 186] Layla: I think Kai might have been involved. 
[Message 187] Maria: But why would Sam protect him?
[Message 188] Layla: I am aware they've been friends for years. Maybe he thought helping Kai would fix whatever mess he was in.
[Message 189] Maria: That would make sense. What are we going to do?
[Message 190] Layla: We have to tell the police. Again. Even if they don't believe us.
[Message 191] Maria: I'm with you. Let's go.
[Message 192] Layla: (The next day) The police searched Kai's apartment. They found blood that matched Ben's DNA.
[Message 193] Maria: So, he was involved after all. Sam covered for him.
[Message 194] Layla: Exactly. Sam’s going away for a long time for this.
[Message 195] Maria: I am so glad this whole thing is over.

7. **Incorporate at least 3 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Late Evening"", ""She was buying Administering a lethal injection at the store"").

        *   **Attendant/Extenuating Circumstances:** References to factors that could influence culpability (e.g., victim's age in a statutory rape hypothetical, potential self-defense claims, evidence of duress, victim's own aggression leading to the crime.)
8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

...","[Message 1] Kai: Hey, have you guys heard about what happened at Amusement Park?
[Message 2] Liv: Yeah, it's all over the news. Brutal.
[Message 3] Ren: I know, right? Crazy. Two people...
[Message 4] Kai: Poor Alex. And the manager.
[Message 5] Liv: It's awful. Alex was just a kid.
[Message 6] Ren: Did they say anything about who did it?
[Message 7] Kai: No, just that they're investigating. I hope they catch the person who did that quickly.
[Message 8] Liv: Me too. I can't believe something like that happened in Gulfport.
[Message 9] Ren: Gulfport is getting crazy these days. It was only a matter of time.
[Message 10] Kai: Don't say that, Ren. It could have happened anywhere.
[Message 11] Liv: True. Anyway, you guys wanna grab coffee later? Distract ourselves?
[Message 12] Ren: I'm in. Need something strong after hearing that.
[Message 13] Kai: I’m free, see you there.
[Message 14] Liv: Cool, noon at Java Joe's?
[Message 15] Ren: Sounds good.
[Message 16] Kai: Perfect.
[Message 17] Ren: So, Kai, you worked security there, right?
[Message 18] Kai: Yeah, but I quit a few months ago. It’s a tough job.
[Message 19] Liv: Did you know Alex well?
[Message 20] Kai: A little. Just from seeing them around. They were always really nice, though.
[Message 21] Ren: That sucks.
[Message 22] Kai: It does.
[Message 23] Liv: I heard the manager, um… Jordan, was kind of a jerk.
[Message 24] Ren: Oh yeah? How so?
[Message 25] Liv: Just… hard to work for, apparently. That’s what my friend who works there told me.
[Message 26] Kai: I heard similar things. But still doesn't justify anything.
[Message 27] Ren: True. Still, makes you wonder.
[Message 28] Liv: Wonder what?
[Message 29] Ren: If someone had a grudge.
[Message 30] Kai: Everyone has something against someone. Doesn't make them a murderer.
[Message 31] Liv: I know, I know. Just thinking out loud.
[Message 32] Ren: Me too.
[Message 33] Kai: Gotta head out, see you guys at noon.
[Message 34] Liv: Later!
[Message 35] Ren: Peace.
[Message 36] Ren: Hey Liv, you still online?
[Message 37] Liv: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 38] Ren: Something's bugging me about Kai.
[Message 39] Liv: What do you mean?
[Message 40] Ren: Just… seemed a little too quick to defend everyone.
[Message 41] Liv: You think Kai had something to do with it?
[Message 42] Ren: I don’t know! It’s probably nothing. But something felt off.
[Message 43] Liv: Kai’s always been a little intense. Remember that time they got into it with that guy at the bar?
[Message 44] Ren: Good point. But this is different. This is murder.
[Message 45] Liv: Alright, alright. I'll keep an eye on them. Don't go accusing anyone without proof.
[Message 46] Ren: I won't. Just… be careful.
[Message 47] Liv: Always am. See you at Java Joe's.
[Message 48] Ren: Later.
[Message 49] Kai: Hey, running a little late. Be there in 15.
[Message 50] Liv: No worries.
[Message 51] Ren: Okay.
[Message 52] Liv: So, Kai, anything new from the news?
[Message 53] Kai: Not really. Just the same stuff. ""Investigation ongoing,"" ""community in shock,"" blah blah blah.
[Message 54] Ren: You seem awfully calm about all this, Kai.
[Message 55] Kai: What's that supposed to mean, Ren?
[Message 56] Ren: Nothing. Just an observation.
[Message 57] Liv: Guys, let's not start. We're here to relax.
[Message 58] Kai: Relax? Two people are dead. How am I supposed to relax?
[Message 59] Ren: Nobody's saying you have to be happy-go-lucky, Kai. Just...you know.
[Message 60] Liv: Ren, drop it.
[Message 61] Kai: No, let him talk. What are you implying, Ren? That I had something to do with it?
[Message 62] Ren: I didn't say that!
[Message 63] Liv: Okay, that's enough! I'm leaving. This isn't helping anyone.
[Message 64] Kai: Liv, wait!
[Message 65] Ren: She's right. This is getting us nowhere.
[Message 66] Kai: Fine. But I'm not gonna sit here and be accused of something I didn't do.
[Message 67] Ren: I didn't accuse you of anything!
[Message 68] Kai: Sure seemed like it.
[Message 69] Liv: (Later that evening) Ren, are you free to talk?
[Message 70] Ren: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 71] Liv: I've been thinking about what you said about Kai.
[Message 72] Ren: And?
[Message 73] Liv: I remembered something. Kai was REALLY upset when Jordan fired them a few months ago. Like, REALLY upset.
[Message 74] Ren: See? I knew something was up.
[Message 75] Liv: It could still be nothing. But it's worth looking into.
[Message 76] Ren: I agree. Maybe we should tell the police.
[Message 77] Liv: Not yet. Let's see what else we can find out first.
[Message 78] Ren: Okay. But if Kai did do this…
[Message 79] Liv: I know. It's a big if.
[Message 80] Ren: I'm just scared.
[Message 81] Liv: Me too.
[Message 82] Kai: (to Ren) Hey, sorry about earlier. I overreacted.
[Message 83] Ren: It's okay. I probably did too.
[Message 84] Kai: Friends?
[Message 85] Ren: Friends.
[Message 86] Kai: I just… I hate that this happened. And I hate that people are gonna automatically suspect anyone who worked there.
[Message 87] Ren: Yeah, I get it.
[Message 88] Kai: I was at the park the day before. Saw both of them. It's hitting me harder than I thought.
[Message 89] Ren: It’s alright to feel.
[Message 90] Kai: Thanks.
[Message 91] Liv: Hey guys, I'm really sorry I bailed earlier. I was being insensitive.
[Message 92] Kai: No worries, Liv. We all are.
[Message 93] Ren: Yeah, no big deal.
[Message 94] Liv: So, any new leads in the case?
[Message 95] Kai: Nope. Just the same old story.
[Message 96] Ren: Nothing.
[Message 97] Liv: I heard a rumor that Alex was planning on quitting. Maybe Jordan didn't like that.
[Message 98] Kai: That's possible. Jordan wasn't exactly known for being understanding.
[Message 99] Ren: Jordan always had that menacing aura around him.
[Message 100] Liv: True. Hey, Ren, weren't you looking into getting a job at Amusement Park?
[Message 101] Ren: Yeah, why?
[Message 102] Liv: Just curious. Guess that's off the table now, huh?
[Message 103] Ren: Probably. Who would want to work there now?
[Message 104] Liv: Good point. Hey, Kai, I have a question. Did Jordan ever mention anything about wanting to get rid of Alex?
[Message 105] Kai: No, never. That’s insane.
[Message 106] Liv: Just wondering.
[Message 107] Ren: It's messed up to even think like that.
[Message 108] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 109] Liv: Guys, something's not adding up. Kai, you said you were at the park the day before, right? What time did you leave?
[Message 110] Kai: Around 7pm. Why?
[Message 111] Liv: Just checking. Did you see anything… unusual?
[Message 112] Kai: No, not really. Just the usual park stuff. People having fun, kids screaming, you know.
[Message 113] Ren: ""Having fun""? Two people are dead, Kai.
[Message 114] Kai: I meant the day before. Before… all of this.
[Message 115] Liv: Okay. I'm going to call the police. This is getting too heavy for us.
[Message 116] Ren: I agree.
[Message 117] Kai: Wait! What are you going to tell them?
[Message 118] Liv: Everything we've talked about. Everything we know.
[Message 119] Kai: That's a mistake.
[Message 120] Ren: Why? What are you hiding, Kai?
[Message 121] Kai: I'm not hiding anything! I just don't want us to get involved. It's dangerous.
[Message 122] Liv: Two people are dead, Kai! How much more involved can we get?
[Message 123] Ren: Exactly.
[Message 124] Kai: Fine. Do what you want. But don't say I didn't warn you.
[Message 125] Liv: Don't try to scare us, Kai. It won't work.
[Message 126] Ren: Yeah, we're not backing down.
[Message 127] Kai: Just… be careful.
[Message 128] Liv: Always am.
[Message 129] Liv: (To Ren, later) Hey, I talked to the police.
[Message 130] Ren: And?
[Message 131] Liv: They're going to look into everything. Kai, Jordan, everything.
[Message 132] Ren: Good.
[Message 133] Liv: I feel a little better knowing they're on it.
[Message 134] Ren: Me too. What about Kai’s reaction?
[Message 135] Liv: Definitely hiding something. I think we are getting closer to the truth.
[Message 136] Ren: I hope so. I cant sleep.
[Message 137] Liv: It is true that Jordan can be quite annoying. He was always picking on me.
[Message 138] Ren: Oh damn. Guess that is true.
[Message 139] Kai: I think Liv called the police and mentioned my name. This is bad.
[Message 140] Ren: Maybe you should call them yourself.
[Message 141] Kai: No way! That will look super suspicious. I rather just wait.
[Message 142] Ren: I think it is a good idea, so you can speak the truth.
[Message 143] Kai: I was protecting my loved ones from getting hurt.
[Message 144] Ren: You always talking about that, Kai. Why?
[Message 145] Kai: It is just something I always believed in. It is stupid. I know!
[Message 146] Ren: I think we should all take a breather.
[Message 147] Liv: I saw Ren buy Administering a lethal injection a few days ago.
[Message 148] Kai: WHAAAT?
[Message 149] Ren: I got it for my dog, he has cancer!
[Message 150] Liv: Oh, okay.
[Message 151] Kai: That is so messed up, Liv.
[Message 152] Ren: I know right. And I'm gonna get in trouble for doing this with him.
[Message 153] Liv: I didn't know, Ren.
[Message 154] Kai: I am going to sleep!
[Message 155] Ren: Good Night!
[Message 156] Liv: Sleep tight!
[Message 157] Ren: The cops are at my door.
[Message 158] Liv: What?!
[Message 159] Ren: I think you are the one that got me in trouble.
[Message 160] Liv: I am so sorry.
[Message 161] Ren: It is alright, just tell the truth.
[Message 162] Liv: Will do.
[Message 163] Liv: Kai, are you awake?
[Message 164] Kai: Yeah, what's going on? I saw police cars heading towards Ren's place.
[Message 165] Liv: They're questioning Ren. I told them about the Administering a lethal injection.
[Message 166] Kai: What?! Are you crazy? You just threw Ren under the bus.
[Message 167] Liv: I had to! It was the right thing to do. Ren always hated Alex.
[Message 168] Kai: That doesn't mean they killed Alex! You need to tell them about Jordan and the way Jordan treated people. It might have provoked something! I was there the other night. I knew they were going to kill him! I tried to talk Ren out of it, but they wouldn't listen.
[Message 169] Liv: I… I didn't know.
[Message 170] Kai: Now two people are going to get the death penalty! And its on you now.

[Message 25] AVA: ""Just that Morgan was a judge. Seemed kinda withdrawn, never really talked to anyone.""
[Message 26] LIAM: ""Riley was always digging for a story, that’s for sure. Ambitious.""
[Message 27] CHLOE: ""Maybe she dug too deep.""
[Message 28] AVA: ""You think she was working on something dangerous?""

[Message 106] LIAM: ""This is all so messed up.""
[Message 107] AVA: ""Agreed. I keep thinking about their families.""
[Message 108] CHLOE: ""Me too. It's heartbreaking.""

[Message 110] AVA: ""That's a great idea, Liam.""
[Message 111] CHLOE: ""I'm in. We could go to the animal shelter.""
[Message 112] LIAM: ""Perfect. We can do that on Saturday.""
[Message 113] AVA: ""Sounds like a plan.""
[Message 114] CHLOE: ""Okay, animal shelter on Saturday it is.""
[Message 115] LIAM: ""Good. Something positive for a change.""
[Message 116] AVA: ""Exactly.""
[Message 117] CHLOE: ""Did either of you guys see Riley Thompson at the gym often?""
[Message 118] LIAM: ""Yeah, pretty regularly. Usually in the mornings.""
[Message 119] AVA: ""Same. She was always on the treadmill.""
[Message 120] CHLOE: ""Okay. Just trying to remember.""
[Message 121] LIAM: ""Why are you asking so many questions, Chloe? You seem... focused.""
[Message 122] CHLOE: ""I'm just trying to understand what happened. Is that a crime?""
[Message 123] AVA: ""No, of course not. We all are.""
[Message 124] LIAM: ""Just feels like you're grilling us, that’s all.""
[Message 125] CHLOE: ""Sorry. Didn't mean to come off that way.""
[Message 126] AVA: ""It's okay, Chloe. We're all a little stressed.""

[Message 131] CHLOE: ""Yeah, animal shelter on Saturday.""
[Message 132] AVA: ""Looking forward to it.""
[Message 133] LIAM: ""Me too. It'll be good to get out.""
[Message 134] CHLOE: ""Anyone hear anything from the cops?""
[Message 135] AVA: ""Not a peep.""
[Message 136] LIAM: ""They're probably keeping things quiet until they have something solid.""
[Message 137] CHLOE: ""Yeah, I guess so.""
[Message 138] AVA: ""It's frustrating though. We all just want answers.""
[Message 139] LIAM: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 140] CHLOE: ""I heard Morgan was about to rule on a really big case.""
[Message 141] AVA: ""Really? What kind of case?""
[Message 142] LIAM: ""Probably something that pissed off a lot of people.""
[Message 143] CHLOE: ""Maybe that's it. Someone wanted to stop her.""
[Message 144] AVA: ""That's messed up.""
[Message 145] LIAM: ""Yeah, but not surprising. Power corrupts. Morgan purposefully provoked that criminal""
[Message 146] CHLOE: ""True.""
[Message 147] AVA: ""Hey, anyone free for coffee tomorrow morning?""
[Message 148] CHLOE: ""I could use a caffeine boost.""
[Message 149] LIAM: ""Count me in. Need to get out of the house.""
[Message 150] AVA: ""Great! I'll text you guys the details.""
[Message 151] CHLOE: ""Sounds good.""
[Message 152] LIAM: ""Cool.""
[Message 153] CHLOE: ""This whole thing is just so… unbelievable.""
[Message 154] AVA: ""I know. It's like something out of a movie.""
[Message 155] LIAM: ""A really bad movie.""
[Message 156] CHLOE: ""I wonder if they'll ever find the murder weapon.""
[Message 157] AVA: ""Hopefully. That would be a big clue.""
[Message 158] LIAM: ""Yeah, or if someone saw something and is too scared to come forward.""
[Message 159] CHLOE: ""That's possible. Maybe they think the killer will come after them.""
[Message 160] AVA: ""This is all so scary.""
[Message 161] LIAM: ""I know. Let's just try to stick together, okay?""
[Message 162] CHLOE: ""Definitely. Safety in numbers.""
[Message 163] AVA: ""Agreed. We're here for each other.""
[Message 164] LIAM: ""Always.""
[Message 165] CHLOE: ""Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.""
[Message 166] AVA: ""Anytime, Chloe.""
[Message 167] LIAM: ""Yeah, anytime.""
[Message 168] CHLOE: ""So, coffee tomorrow then?""
[Message 169] AVA: ""Yep! Tomorrow it is.""
[Message 170] LIAM: ""Looking forward to it.""
[Message 171] CHLOE: ""Me too. Need to get my mind off things.""
[Message 172] AVA: ""Same here.""
[Message 173] LIAM: ""Okay, guys. Talk to you tomorrow.""

[Message 65] Sam: ""Well, back to the grind. Later, guys.""
[Message 66] Alex: ""Later, Sam.""
[Message 67] Jordan: ""Bye.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Jordan, did you hear anything else about the Bakery fire?""
[Message 69] Jordan: ""Just what's on the news. Why?""
[Message 70] Alex: ""No reason. Just curious.""
[Message 71] Jordan: ""Okay…""
[Message 72] Alex: ""Did he always hated 1.  Law Enforcement Officer?""
[Message 73] Jordan: ""Who?""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Thompson. Did he like Davis?""
[Message 75] Jordan: ""I have no idea, Alex. Why are you so focused on this?""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Just trying to understand what happened. It's bothering me.""
[Message 77] Jordan: ""I get it, but maybe you should let the police handle it.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""Yeah, maybe you're right.""
[Message 79] Jordan: ""Definitely.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Think they'll catch him? It's a small town.""
[Message 81] Sam: ""Heard they found some accelerant at the scene. Definitely Arson by setting a fire.""
[Message 82] Jordan: ""Seriously? That's awful.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""So much for faulty wiring.""
[Message 84] Sam: ""Yep. Someone wanted them dead.""
[Message 85] Jordan: ""I can't believe it.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""The world is a messed up place.""
[Message 87] Sam: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 88] Jordan: ""Anyway, I'm going to make some tea. Anyone want some?""
[Message 89] Alex: ""I'm good, thanks.""
[Message 90] Sam: ""No, thanks.""
[Message 91] Jordan: ""Okay. Just thought I'd offer.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""Appreciate it.""
[Message 93] Sam: ""Later, I have to attend to the baby. She is been crying all day""
[Message 94] Alex: ""Bye.""
[Message 95] Jordan: ""Hope you get some rest""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Do you ever think about running away?""
[Message 97] Jordan: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Just packing up and leaving. Starting over somewhere new.""
[Message 99] Jordan: ""Sometimes, yeah. But where would we go?""
[Message 100] Alex: ""Somewhere where nobody knows us. Somewhere peaceful.""
[Message 101] Jordan: ""Sounds nice, but it's not realistic, Alex.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""I know, I know. Just a thought.""
[Message 103] Jordan: ""Hey, I'm going to watch a movie. Want to join?""
[Message 104] Alex: ""What are you watching?""
[Message 105] Jordan: ""Just some dumb rom-com. Need something light.""
[Message 106] Alex: ""Okay, I'll come watch with you.""
[Message 107] Jordan: ""Great! Be right there.""
[Message 108] Sam: ""Anyone know if they have suspects yet?""
[Message 109] Alex: ""Haven't heard anything.""
[Message 110] Jordan: ""Me neither.""
[Message 111] Sam: ""They need to catch this guy. Before he hurts someone else.""
[Message 112] Alex: ""Agreed.""
[Message 113] Jordan: ""Absolutely.""
[Message 114] Alex: ""I wonder what Thompson was working on before he died.""
[Message 115] Jordan: ""Probably a lot of cases. He was a judge.""
[Message 116] Alex: ""Yeah, but maybe something specific. Something that made someone want him dead.""
[Message 117] Jordan: ""You're really fixated on this, Alex.""
[Message 118] Alex: ""I can't help it. It's just... disturbing.""
[Message 119] Jordan: ""I get it. But don't let it consume you.""
[Message 120] Alex: ""I'm trying not to.""
[Message 121] Jordan: ""That's all I ask.""
[Message 122] Sam: ""Just saw on the news that they're looking for anyone who had a grudge against Thompson or Davis.""
[Message 123] Alex: ""That's a lot of people, probably.""
[Message 124] Jordan: ""True. Thompson wasn't exactly popular.""
[Message 125] Sam: ""No kidding. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 126] Alex: ""He was looking up how to make Arson by setting a fire online.""
[Message 127] Jordan: ""Who was?""
[Message 128] Alex: ""Oh, nothing. Just something I read online. Nevermind""
[Message 129] Jordan: ""Okay…""
[Message 130] Alex: ""I have to go""
[Message 131] Jordan: ""Where""
[Message 132] Alex: ""Out""
[Message 133] Jordan: ""Okay""
[Message 134] Sam: ""Heard the police were taking a look at employee records. Someone might have snapped.""
[Message 135] Alex: ""That makes sense.""
[Message 136] Jordan: ""It does. A lot of pressure working at the Bakery, I bet.""
[Message 137] Sam: ""Yep. Especially with that Thompson breathing down everyone's necks.""
[Message 138] Alex: ""Did he know she was buying Arson by setting a fire at the store?""
[Message 139] Jordan: ""Who are you talking about, Alex?""
[Message 140] Alex: ""I'm just saying. Everyone will get it.""
[Message 141] Jordan: ""Right...""
[Message 142] Sam: ""Well, I'm going to try to get some sleep. Exhausted.""
[Message 143] Alex: ""Goodnight.""
[Message 144] Jordan: ""Goodnight, Sam.""
[Message 145] Alex: ""Maybe all of this will disappear soon.""

...","[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey Liam, you okay? Heard about what happened at Town Hall.

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, Chloe, it’s messed up. I knew both Kai and Jordan. Especially Jordan, we worked together.

[Message 3] CHLOE: I can't believe that 9.  Bartender is gone. Poor Kai

[Message 4] LIAM: Right?

[Message 5] ASH: Guys, this is awful. I saw Amelia near Town Hall Dead of Night.

[Message 6] CHLOE: Amelia? Really? What was she doing?

[Message 7] LIAM: Ash, are you sure? Did you actually see her?

[Message 8] ASH: Positive. Around 1 AM. Seemed like she was arguing with someone.

[Message 9] CHLOE: Arguing? About what? This is getting weirder. You know Amelia got fired from town hall?

[Message 10] LIAM: Fired? When? Why? I didn't know that.

[Message 11] ASH: Few weeks ago, apparently. Something about her performance. Jordan was the one who signed off on it, I think.

[Message 12] CHLOE: This is insane. Did she knew about Jordan?

[Message 13] LIAM: Probably. Everyone knew each other.

[Message 14] ASH: Anyone hear from Ben? He was always complaining about Kai being too loud during his shifts.

[Message 15] CHLOE: Ben? Nah. He's probably just holed up somewhere playing video games. He always hated 9.  Bartender though.

[Message 16] LIAM: Yeah, Ben's a bit of a loner. Wonder if the cops have talked to him.

[Message 17] ASH: They must have. Liam, you working today?

[Message 18] LIAM: No, thankfully. Took the day off. Needed it.

[Message 19] CHLOE: I'm going to need a drink later. You in?

[Message 20] LIAM: Definitely.

[Message 21] ASH: Count me in too.

[Message 22] CHLOE: Okay, good. I'm so shaken up from this.

[Message 23] LIAM: Me too. Thinking of Jordan’s family. This is messed up.

[Message 24] ASH: Okay, I’m heading to work. Catch you guys later.

[Message 25] CHLOE: Later, Ash. Stay safe.

[Message 26] LIAM: Later.

[Message 27] CHLOE: Liam, between us, do you think Amelia could've done it?

[Message 28] LIAM: Chloe, I don’t know. It's hard to believe, but that argument Ash mentioned... and her getting fired...

[Message 29] CHLOE: Yeah, it's suspicious. But Pushing from a height seems so… premeditated.

[Message 30] LIAM: Exactly.

[Message 31] CHLOE: I saw Amelia buying Pushing from a height at the store.

[Message 32] LIAM: I feel bad pointing fingers without any proof.

[Message 33] CHLOE: I do too, but we need to think about who would’ve wanted them dead.

[Message 34] LIAM: True. Maybe Ben had a breaking point with Kai?

[Message 35] CHLOE: Maybe. But Ben doesn’t strike me as someone who would plan something like that.

[Message 36] LIAM: Me neither. He’s more of a complain-about-it type.

[Message 37] CHLOE: Remember how furious Ben was when Kai shorted him a drink?

[Message 38] LIAM: Vaguely. Everyone gets mad about short drinks. It's not a motive for murder.

[Message 39] CHLOE: True. Just trying to think of anything.

[Message 40] LIAM: Me too. This is going to be all over the news for weeks.

[Message 41] CHLOE: The media is going to eat this up.

[Message 42] LIAM: Definitely.

[Message 43] ASH: Hey, guys. Work was crazy. Everyone's talking about it.

[Message 44] CHLOE: I can imagine.

[Message 45] LIAM: Yeah, it must be.

[Message 46] ASH: Heard the cops are looking into everyone who had any kind of beef with Jordan or Kai.

[Message 47] CHLOE: That’s everyone at Town Hall, then.

[Message 48] LIAM: Almost. This is insane.

[Message 49] ASH: So, about tonight, same place as always?

[Message 50] CHLOE: Yeah, sounds good. I need a strong one. Or five.

[Message 51] LIAM: Make that six for me.

[Message 52] ASH: Haha, alright. See you both later.

[Message 53] CHLOE: Later.

[Message 54] LIAM: Later.

[Message 55] CHLOE: Liam, you think they’ll ever catch whoever did this?

[Message 56] LIAM: I hope so, Chloe. For Jordan and Kai's families. And for our peace of mind.

[Message 57] CHLOE: Me too. It's terrifying to think someone we know is capable of something like this.

[Message 58] LIAM: Exactly. It’s like something out of a movie.

[Message 59] CHLOE: A horror movie.

[Message 60] LIAM: Definitely.

[Message 61] ASH: Hey, you guys still on for tonight? Just checking.

[Message 62] CHLOE: Yeah, definitely. Need to vent.

[Message 63] LIAM: Still in.

[Message 64] ASH: Cool. See you both soon.

[Message 65] CHLOE: See ya.

[Message 66] LIAM: Later.

[Message 67] CHLOE: Liam, something's bugging me.

[Message 68] LIAM: What's that?

[Message 69] CHLOE: When Ash said she saw Amelia arguing, she didn't say who Amelia was arguing *with*.

[Message 70] LIAM: True. She was buying Pushing from a height at the store. Could be no one, though.

[Message 71] CHLOE: I know, but… what if it was Jordan? Or Kai?

[Message 72] LIAM: Maybe. We're reaching, Chloe.

[Message 73] CHLOE: I know, I know. Just thinking out loud. This whole thing feels… off.

[Message 74] LIAM: Agreed.

[Message 75] ASH: Hey, running a bit late. See you both in like 20?

[Message 76] CHLOE: No worries.

[Message 77] LIAM: Cool.

[Message 78] CHLOE: Liam, did you notice how quickly Ash changed the subject earlier, when we were talking about Amelia?

[Message 79] LIAM: I did notice that, yeah. What do you think it means?

[Message 80] CHLOE: I don't know. Maybe she knows more than she's letting on. Or maybe she's just uncomfortable talking about it.

[Message 81] LIAM: Could be either. This whole thing is making me paranoid.

[Message 82] CHLOE: Same here. I keep replaying everything in my head, trying to find some clue we missed.

[Message 83] LIAM: Me too. It's exhausting.

[Message 84] CHLOE: Yeah. Maybe a drink will help us relax.

[Message 85] LIAM: Hopefully.

[Message 86] ASH: Hey, I'm here. Where are you guys sitting?

[Message 87] CHLOE: We're at the usual table, near the back.

[Message 88] LIAM: Yeah, back corner.

[Message 89] ASH: Okay, be right there.

[Message 90] CHLOE: Liam, I have a bad feeling about this.

[Message 91] LIAM: About what? Ash?

[Message 92] CHLOE: Yeah. Something's just not adding up. He said she wanted to get rid of him.

[Message 93] LIAM: Okay, let's just try to stay calm and observe. Don't say anything accusatory.

[Message 94] CHLOE: Agreed.

[Message 95] ASH: Sorry I’m late. Traffic was awful.

[Message 96] CHLOE: No problem.

[Message 97] LIAM: All good. What will you have?

[Message 98] ASH: Just a beer for now. Thanks.

[Message 99] CHLOE: So, Ash, about what you saw Dead of Night…

[Message 100] LIAM: Chloe, maybe we should just drop it.

[Message 101] ASH: What about it?

[Message 102] CHLOE: Just wondering if you remembered anything else. Any details.

[Message 103] ASH: Not really. It was dark. I just saw Amelia yelling. I didn't hear what she was saying.

[Message 104] LIAM: It's okay, Ash. We’re just trying to figure things out.

[Message 105] CHLOE: Yeah, no pressure.

[Message 106] ASH: It’s fine. Just… stressful, you know? Hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 107] LIAM: Yeah. Stressful for everyone.

[Message 108] CHLOE: Definitely.

[Message 109] ASH: You guys think they’ll find the person who did this soon?

[Message 110] CHLOE: I hope so. The sooner, the better.

[Message 111] LIAM: Me too.

[Message 112] ASH: Well, I’m gonna head home. This beer is making me sleepy.

[Message 113] CHLOE: Alright. Get home safe.

[Message 114] LIAM: Yeah, be careful.

[Message 115] ASH: Will do. Later.

[Message 116] CHLOE: Later.

[Message 117] LIAM: Bye.

[Message 118] CHLOE: Liam, I am so convinced Ash is hiding something.

[Message 119] LIAM: I know. But what could it be?

[Message 120] CHLOE: Maybe… maybe she was there too. Maybe she saw more than she's letting on because she was involved somehow. She was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.

[Message 121] LIAM: Whoa, Chloe. Slow down. That’s a big leap.

[Message 122] CHLOE: I know, but think about it! She changed the subject, she was vague about the argument, and she seemed really eager to leave tonight.

[Message 123] LIAM: It's possible. But maybe she's just freaked out. This is a huge deal.

[Message 124] CHLOE: Maybe. But I don't trust her.

[Message 125] LIAM: Okay, what do we do?

[Message 126] CHLOE: I don't know. But I think we need to be careful around her.

[Message 127] LIAM: Agreed. Let's just keep our eyes open.

[Message 128] CHLOE: Okay. I'm going home too. This night has been too much.

[Message 129] LIAM: Me too. Get home safe.

[Message 130] CHLOE: You too.

[Message 131] LIAM: Night.

[Message 132] CHLOE: Night.

[Message 133] LIAM: I just remembered something. Ash knew about Ben's dislike for Kai.

[Message 134] CHLOE: Oh god. He was looking up how to make Pushing from a height online.

[Message 135] LIAM: Yeah. I'm starting to think you might be right about Ash.

[Message 136] CHLOE: Okay, Liam, we need to go to the police.

[Message 137] LIAM: I think you're right.

[Message 138] CHLOE: First thing in the morning.

[Message 139] LIAM: Agreed. Let's try to get some sleep. We're going to need it.

[Message 140] CHLOE: Okay. Goodnight, Liam. Be safe.

[Message 35] Alex: ""Makes sense. I had to buy Pushing from a height at the store yesterday, that's all i did.""
[Message 36] Riley: ""Did you see anything suspicious at the garden yesterday, Jamie?""
[Message 37] Jamie: ""I wasn't even near the garden, Riley! Why are you asking me that?""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Easy, Riley. Just curious, I guess.""
[Message 39] Riley: ""Sorry, Jamie. Just on edge, I guess. I heard Frank was talking about hurting Sarah right before.""
[Message 40] Jamie: ""It's fine. I understand. This whole thing is unsettling.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""I heard that Frank was ending a prolonged period of abuse against a friend. Its the only thing that comes to mind.""
[Message 42] Riley: ""Wow, if true, that's messed up. Abuse is never the answer.""
[Message 43] Jamie: ""Agreed. Sounds like Frank had a lot of enemies.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Maybe. Or maybe someone just wanted something he had. Like that business competitor thing.""
[Message 45] Riley: ""Speaking of wanting something, I could really go for some pizza.""
[Message 46] Jamie: ""Pizza sounds good. What kind?""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Pepperoni, always a classic.""
[Message 48] Riley: ""Agreed. I'm starving. Let's order one later?""
[Message 49] Jamie: ""Sounds like a plan. Anyone else you think could be involved?""
[Message 50] Alex: ""Who knows. Chicago's a big city.""
[Message 51] Riley: ""True. Could be anyone with a grudge.""
[Message 52] Jamie: ""Or someone who knew about Frank's… business dealings.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Right. Maybe Sarah knew something too.""
[Message 54] Riley: ""Poor Sarah. She was always so nice.""
[Message 55] Jamie: ""Yeah, always had a smile on her face.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""I bet the manager at the garden is freaking out.""
[Message 57] Riley: ""I'd be surprised if they weren't. Major PR nightmare.""
[Message 58] Jamie: ""Definitely. Hope they catch the people responsible soon.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Me too. This is making me want to stay inside forever.""
[Message 60] Riley: ""I know, right? I'm locking all my doors tonight.""
[Message 61] Jamie: ""Same here. Stay safe, you guys.""
[Message 62] Alex: ""You too. Night.""
[Message 63] Riley: ""Night.""
[Message 64] Jamie: ""Hey, Alex, quick question. Did you by any chance see my green jacket at your place? I cant find it anywhere""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Nope, haven't seen it. Maybe you left it at the gym?""
[Message 66] Jamie: ""Good call, I'll check tomorrow. You think it was a planned hit, not a random thing?""
[Message 67] Alex: ""With Frank being a Drug Dealer, probably planned. I saw him leave the building at Midday the other day and never saw him again. Maybe this is why.""
[Message 68] Riley: ""guysss, can we talk about something else. This is freaking me outttt.""
[Message 69] Jamie: ""Sorry, Riley! Just speculating. Watching a funny movie now, so that's helping.""
[Message 70] Alex: ""Yeah, same here. Distraction is key.""
[Message 71] Riley: ""Agreed. Pizza is still on the table, right?""
[Message 72] Jamie: ""Of course! Pizza will solve everything.""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Well, not *everything*, but it'll help.""
[Message 74] Riley: ""True that. What if Frank had fired Sarah, maybe none of this would have happened""
[Message 75] Jamie: ""Could be. We're all just guessing at this point. The police have to figure it all out.""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Yeah, hopefully they have some leads.""
[Message 77] Riley: ""I hope they don't get the death penalty, that is too much.""
[Message 78] Jamie: ""Well, depends on the circumstances, right? If it was premeditated…""
[Message 79] Alex: ""True. I am aware that Sarah tried to talk him out of it, wonder what that means.""
[Message 80] Riley: ""Omg, Alex stop it! You are making me feel worse!""
[Message 81] Jamie: ""Alex, maybe lay off the true crime for tonight?""
[Message 82] Alex: ""Sorry, sorry. Just thinking out loud.""
[Message 83] Riley: ""Okay, good. Pizza it is then!""
[Message 84] Jamie: ""Perfect. Let's order in an hour?""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Sounds good to me. Want to order together?""
[Message 86] Riley: ""Yeah, let's do a group call. I need to see your faces!""
[Message 87] Jamie: ""Haha, okay. An hour it is.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""See you then.""
[Message 89] Riley: ""Bye!""
[Message 90] Jamie: ""Later!""
[Message 91] Alex: ""Did you hear about that guy being arrested for drug possession yesterday?""
[Message 92] Jamie: ""No, where?""
[Message 93] Alex: ""Downtown. Apparently, he was carrying a lot.""
[Message 94] Jamie: ""Wow. Seems like the cops are cracking down.""
[Message 95] Riley: ""Maybe they are trying to distract from the murder""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Maybe. Or maybe it's just a coincidence.""
[Message 97] Jamie: ""Hard to say. So many things happening all the time.""
[Message 98] Riley: ""True. It's overwhelming.""
[Message 99] Alex: ""Yeah. Let's just focus on the pizza later.""
[Message 100] Jamie: ""Agreed. Pizza therapy is needed.""
[Message 101] Riley: ""Definitely. My shout! So excited.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""Perfect! Can't wait.""
[Message 103] Jamie: ""Same here. Talk soon!""
[Message 104] Riley: ""Okay, gotta run and decide what I am going to order, pizza wise!""
[Message 105] Alex: ""Sounds good. Later!""

[Message 2] <Speaker Name>: ""..."" 
...","[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone, have you heard about what happened at the gym?
[Message 2] Bailey: Yeah, it's all over the news. Absolutely awful. Dawn gym, right?
[Message 3] Casey: I can't believe it. Two people...gone. Who were they?
[Message 4] Alex: I heard it was... uh... Sarah and Jamie.
[Message 5] Dana: Jamie? The journalist? No way.
[Message 6] Bailey: And Sarah, the manager, right? God, that's terrible.
[Message 7] Casey: I used to see Jamie all the time. Always seemed so kind.
[Message 8] Alex: Yeah, it's messed up. Worcester PD must be swamped.
[Message 9] Dana: Do they know what happened?
[Message 10] Bailey: Poisoning via ingestion, apparently. Can you imagine?
[Message 11] Casey: Poisoning via ingestion? That's...intense.
[Message 12] Alex: I know, right? Who even does that anymore?
[Message 13] Dana: Maybe it was accidental? Like bad supplements or something?
[Message 14] Bailey: Doubt it. They're saying it was deliberate.
[Message 15] Casey: This is insane. I was just talking to Jamie last week.
[Message 16] Alex: About what?
[Message 17] Casey: Just work stuff. He was asking about the new fitness program. Nothing weird.
[Message 18] Dana: You should tell the police that, Casey. Every little bit helps.
[Message 19] Bailey: Seriously. They're going to be asking everyone questions.
[Message 20] Casey: Yeah, I guess. I'm just so shaken up.
[Message 21] Alex: Me too. I saw Sarah arguing with someone a few days ago.
[Message 22] Dana: Who was she arguing with, Alex?
[Message 23] Alex: I couldn't really tell. It was near the locker rooms. Sounded like a man.
[Message 24] Bailey: That's interesting... Did you see him leave the building after?
[Message 25] Alex: Nope, just heard them. I had to get to my class.
[Message 26] Dana: Well, that's still useful information.
[Message 27] Casey: This whole thing is just so unsettling.
[Message 28] Alex: Tell me about it. I keep thinking about their families.
[Message 29] Bailey: Did either of you know them well?
[Message 30] Casey: Not really. Just gym acquaintances.
[Message 31] Alex: Same here. Casual hellos, that's about it.
[Message 32] Dana: Okay. I'm going to call the police. I have some things I need to tell them.
[Message 33] Bailey: Good idea, Dana. Let us know if there's anything we can do.
[Message 34] Casey: Yeah, anything at all.
[Message 35] Alex: So, anyone else thinking about cancelling their gym membership? Too soon?
[Message 36] Bailey: A little too soon, Alex.
[Message 37] Casey: I might switch gyms for a while. Just...can't face it right now.
[Message 38] Alex: Understandable.
[Message 39] Dana: I told the police everything I know.
[Message 40] Bailey: And? Did they seem to have any leads?
[Message 41] Dana: They wouldn't say. Just took my statement.
[Message 42] Casey: I wonder if it was someone they knew.
[Message 43] Alex: Statistically, it usually is.
[Message 44] Bailey: Scary thought. I saw Sarah buying some weird stuff last week too.
[Message 45] Dana: What kind of stuff?
[Message 46] Bailey: Some cleaning supplies and these, like, really strong breath mints. Like the kind that burn your throat.
[Message 47] Casey: Maybe she was just cleaning her apartment?
[Message 48] Alex: Yeah, maybe.
[Message 49] Dana: I'm just so creeped out. I can't believe this happened in Worcester.
[Message 50] Bailey: Me neither. It's like something out of a movie.
[Message 51] Casey: I'm going to try to get some sleep. This has been a long day.
[Message 52] Alex: Good night, Casey.
[Message 53] Bailey: Night.
[Message 54] Dana: Good night.
[Message 55] Alex: Hey, Bailey, you still up?
[Message 56] Bailey: Yeah, just watching TV. What's up?
[Message 57] Alex: Did you ever hear Sarah and Jamie talking? I always thought they didn't get along.
[Message 58] Bailey: You know, I think I did hear them arguing once. Seemed like Sarah was upset about something Jamie wrote.
[Message 59] Alex: About what?
[Message 60] Bailey: I didn't catch what it was about. But Sarah seemed pissed.
[Message 61] Alex: Maybe Jamie's journalism got him into trouble.
[Message 62] Bailey: Could be. He was always digging into things.
[Message 63] Alex: Remember that article he did on the mayor?
[Message 64] Bailey: Oh yeah. That was pretty scathing.
[Message 65] Alex: I bet someone wanted him silenced.
[Message 66] Bailey: You think so? That's a pretty big leap, Alex.
[Message 67] Alex: Just saying, it's a possibility.
[Message 68] Bailey: True. Anything's possible at this point.
[Message 69] Dana: Alex, Bailey, I found something disturbing online.
[Message 70] Alex: What is it?
[Message 71] Bailey: Spill.
[Message 72] Dana: Someone posted a comment on Jamie's last article saying ""He knew too much. He had to be stopped.""
[Message 73] Alex: Holy crap.
[Message 74] Bailey: Screenshot that, Dana. And send it to the police.
[Message 75] Dana: Already did. It's definitely a threat.
[Message 76] Alex: Maybe Jamie was investigating something dangerous.
[Message 77] Bailey: That definitely sounds like the actus reus.
[Message 78] Dana: Maybe he was getting too close to someone's secrets.
[Message 79] Alex: Or someone Sarah knew. Maybe it wasn't about Jamie at all.
[Message 80] Bailey: Could be. We're just guessing at this point.
[Message 81] Dana: I just hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 82] Alex: Me too. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 83] Bailey: So, anyone heard anything else new?
[Message 84] Casey: Hey guys, sorry I was sleeping. Anything new on Jamie and Sarah?
[Message 85] Alex: Just theories and speculation. Dana found a threatening comment online.
[Message 86] Bailey: Police have it now.
[Message 87] Casey: That's good. I'm still so freaked out.
[Message 88] Alex: I saw Dana at the pharmacy yesterday. She was buying a bunch of stuff.
[Message 89] Bailey: What kind of stuff?
[Message 90] Alex: Just cold medicine, I think. I didn't really look closely.
[Message 91] Dana: Yeah, I had a terrible cold. Been feeling awful.
[Message 92] Casey: Hope you feel better soon, Dana.
[Message 93] Alex: Did Jamie ever mention anything about being threatened, Casey?
[Message 94] Casey: No, never. He always seemed so upbeat.
[Message 95] Bailey: Maybe he was good at hiding it.
[Message 96] Alex: Or maybe it was Sarah who was the target all along. The manager.
[Message 97] Dana: This is so messed up. I intended on calling the police, but forgot with this cold.
[Message 98] Bailey: So, you knew about him being hurt and you purposefully didn't call 911?
[Message 99] Casey: So you intended on calling 911 and then failed to call them?
[Message 100] Alex: Why did you wait so long to call the police, Dana? This feels like concurrence.

[Message 86] ANNA: ""Hey, did either of you know Jamie was planning on filing a complaint against someone at the Construction Site?""
[Message 87] CHLOE: ""No way! Against who?""
[Message 88] BECKY: ""That's crazy. I hadn't heard anything.""
[Message 89] ANNA: ""Apparently, it was about some kind of safety violation. And that was right before he was killed. ""
[Message 90] CHLOE: ""Okay, that's suspicious. Makes you wonder if the shouting provoked him.""
[Message 91] BECKY: ""Definitely. Sounds like he stepped on some toes.""
[Message 92] ANNA: ""Yeah, the police will have a field day with that.""
[Message 93] CHLOE: ""They're going to need a bigger whiteboard.""
[Message 94] BECKY: ""Seriously. This is getting messier by the minute.""
[Message 95] ANNA: ""Agreed. So many potential motives.""
[Message 96] CHLOE: ""Almost makes you feel bad for the cops.""
[Message 97] BECKY: ""Almost. But they signed up for it.""
[Message 98] ANNA: ""True. Okay, I gotta run. See you guys later.""
[Message 99] CHLOE: ""Bye.""
[Message 100] BECKY: ""Later.""
[Message 101] CHLOE: ""Hey Anna, you still up for Saturday?""
[Message 102] ANNA: ""Yeah, definitely. Need a distraction after all this craziness.""
[Message 103] CHLOE: ""Same here. So much for a quiet week.""
[Message 104] ANNA: ""Tell me about it. Anyway, anything new on the Jamie front?""
[Message 105] CHLOE: ""Not really. Still just rumors and speculation.""
[Message 106] ANNA: ""Hopefully, they catch the right person.""
[Message 107] CHLOE: ""Agreed. It's scary knowing someone like that is out there.""
[Message 108] ANNA: ""Yeah, it is. Makes you think.""
[Message 109] CHLOE: ""It does. Well, I'm going to try and relax for a bit. Talk later?""
[Message 110] ANNA: ""Sounds good. Later.""
[Message 111] BECKY: ""Did either of you know that Jamie and Mark got into a HUGE argument last week?""
[Message 112] CHLOE: ""No way! About what?""
[Message 113] ANNA: ""Seriously? I hadn't heard that.""
[Message 114] BECKY: ""Apparently, Mark confronted Jamie about the complaint. Said Jamie was ruining his life. And he intended to do harm.""
[Message 115] CHLOE: ""Okay, that sounds pretty incriminating.""
[Message 116] ANNA: ""Definitely. Sounds like Mark was ready to snap.""
[Message 117] BECKY: ""Yup. Just thought you guys should know.""
[Message 118] CHLOE: ""Thanks for the info, Becky.""
[Message 119] ANNA: ""Yeah, appreciate it.""
[Message 120] BECKY: ""No problem. Stay safe out there.""
[Message 121] CHLOE: ""You too.""
[Message 122] ANNA: ""You as well.""
[Message 123] CHLOE: ""Hey, Anna, something's been bugging me.""
[Message 124] ANNA: ""What's that?""
[Message 125] CHLOE: ""Remember how Becky said she 'might have' seen Mark leave the building yesterday morning?""
[Message 126] ANNA: ""Yeah...?""
[Message 127] CHLOE: ""Seemed kinda weird, right? Like she was holding something back.""
[Message 128] ANNA: ""Maybe. Becky's always been a bit reserved.""
[Message 129] CHLOE: ""True, but... I don't know. Just a feeling.""
[Message 130] ANNA: ""Well, let's not jump to conclusions. But I agree, something feels off.""
[Message 131] CHLOE: ""Okay, good. I'm not crazy.""
[Message 132] ANNA: ""Not crazy. Just observant.""
[Message 133] CHLOE: ""Thanks. Needed to hear that.""
[Message 134] ANNA: ""Anytime.""
[Message 135] BECKY: ""Hey, just wanted to say I won't be able to make it to the brewery on Saturday.""
[Message 136] CHLOE: ""Oh, that's a bummer! Everything okay?""
[Message 137] ANNA: ""Yeah, what's up?""
[Message 138] BECKY: ""Something came up. Family emergency. Gotta head out of town.""
[Message 139] CHLOE: ""Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Hope everything's alright.""
[Message 140] ANNA: ""Yeah, sending good vibes your way. Be safe.""
[Message 141] BECKY: ""Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.""
[Message 142] CHLOE: ""Of course. Let us know if you need anything.""
[Message 143] ANNA: ""Yeah, seriously. We're here for you.""
[Message 144] BECKY: ""Will do. Talk soon.""
[Message 145] CHLOE: ""Later.""
[Message 146] ANNA: ""Take care.""
[Message 147] CHLOE: ""Anna, Becky's leaving town right after Jamie's murder...""
[Message 148] ANNA: ""I know... the timing is sus.""
[Message 149] CHLOE: ""Really sus. And her 'family emergency' just conveniently popped up?""
[Message 150] ANNA: ""Exactly. I think we should tell the police about this failure to call 911 after Jamie was hurt, making the harm worse..""
[Message 151] CHLOE: ""I agree. Even if she didn't do it, she knows something.""
[Message 152] ANNA: ""Definitely. Let's call them now.""
[Message 153] CHLOE: ""Okay. On it.""
[Message 154] ANNA: ""Hope they catch her. And she pays for this""
[Message 155] CHLOE: ""Me too. This is crazy.""
[Message 156] ANNA: ""Yeah, it is. Never thought someone we knew could be involved.""
[Message 157] CHLOE: ""Me neither. Scary stuff.""
[Message 158] ANNA: ""Well, let's just hope justice is served.""
[Message 159] CHLOE: ""Agreed. Talk soon.""

...","[Message 1] Liam: Hey guys, heard about what happened at Amusement Park last night? Crazy.
[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, it's all over the news. Two people dead. Awful.
[Message 3] Noah: Unbelievable. Anyone know who it was?
[Message 4] Liam: They said it was 9.  Bartender and that Security Guard.
[Message 5] Maya: Poor Mark (Bartender). He was such a creative guy. Always had a smile on his face.
[Message 6] Noah: And David (Security Guard) was just a kid. So withdrawn.
[Message 7] Liam: I saw Ben (Suspect 3) heading that way earlier that night. Wonder if he saw anything.
[Message 8] Maya: Maybe. Ben knows everyone in town.
[Message 9] Noah: Ben's always hanging around Amusement Park. It's like his second home.
[Message 10] Ben: Yo, what's up? Yeah, I was there. Didn't see anything though. Left early.
[Message 11] Liam: Early? What time is early for you, Ben?
[Message 12] Ben: Like, 11? Got bored. Headed home.
[Message 13] Maya: The news said it happened at Dead of Night. That's way later than 11.
[Message 14] Ben: News exaggerates everything, Maya.
[Message 15] Liam: Did anyone see where Alex (Suspect 1) and Chris (Suspect 2) was?
[Message 16] Maya: Alex? He was complaining about 9.  Bartender getting all the attention at work all day.
[Message 17] Noah: Chris was supposed to be working security last night, wasn't he?
[Message 18] Liam: Yeah, he swapped shifts with David (Security Guard) at the last minute. Weird, right?
[Message 19] Ben: Maybe Chris (Suspect 2) called in sick? Happens all the time.
[Message 20] Maya: Chris never calls in sick. He needs the money.
[Message 21] Liam: This is messed up. Two people are dead.
[Message 22] Noah: Agreed. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 23] Ben: For real. People getting hurt ain't cool.
[Message 24] Maya: You guys think it was a robbery gone wrong?
[Message 25] Liam: Could be. That place has been hit before.
[Message 26] Noah: Maybe. But Mark (Bartender) and David (Security Guard) seemed like nice guys. Who would want to hurt them?
[Message 27] Ben: People are messed up, Noah. You know that.
[Message 28] Maya: True.
[Message 29] Liam: I heard Alex (Suspect 1) and Mark (Bartender) got into a fight last week. Something about Alex (Suspect 1) getting fired.
[Message 30] Maya: Seriously? I didn't know that. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 31] Noah: Alex (Suspect 1) has a temper.
[Message 32] Ben: I heard Alex (Suspect 1) was saying he wanted to get rid of him.
[Message 33] Liam: So Alex (Suspect 1) hated 9.  Bartender? Makes him look real suspicious now.
[Message 34] Maya: What about Chris (Suspect 2)? Anything weird about him lately?
[Message 35] Noah: He's been acting jumpy. Like he's hiding something.
[Message 36] Ben: Maybe he's just stressed about money.
[Message 37] Liam: Anyone know what time Chris (Suspect 2) left?
[Message 38] Maya: No idea. I didn't see him at all last night.
[Message 39] Noah: I saw Chris (Suspect 2) near Amusement Park around 10. He was walking fast.
[Message 40] Ben: Lots of people walk near Amusement Park. Doesn't mean anything.
[Message 41] Liam: I guess. But it's still weird.
[Message 42] Maya: This whole thing is weird.
[Message 43] Noah: Agreed.
[Message 44] Ben: Okay, I'm out. Gotta run.
[Message 45] Liam: Where are you going, Ben?
[Message 46] Ben: Just... out. Don't worry about it.
[Message 47] Maya: Suspicious, Ben. Very suspicious.
[Message 48] Noah: What's up with him?
[Message 49] Liam: No idea. But I don't like it.
[Message 50] Maya: Me neither.
[Message 51] Liam: Hey, anyone remember what Chris (Suspect 2) was wearing last night?
[Message 52] Maya: I don't think I saw him.
[Message 53] Noah: Dark jacket, I think. And jeans.
[Message 54] Liam: Okay. Just checking.
[Message 55] Maya: Why?
[Message 56] Liam: No reason. Just trying to piece things together.
[Message 57] Noah: This is going to haunt me.
[Message 58] Liam: Me too, Noah. Me too.
[Message 59] Maya: Lets change the subject. What is everyone having for dinner?
[Message 60] Noah: Pizza.
[Message 61] Ben: Sushi
[Message 62] Liam: Nice! I am thinking of making stake.
[Message 63] Maya: Good food choices!
[Message 64] Liam: So, back to the case. Anyone else think Alex (Suspect 1) and Chris (Suspect 2) could be working together?
[Message 65] Maya: Hmm, never thought of that.
[Message 66] Noah: They have been friends for a long time.
[Message 67] Ben: That is a long shot. But possible.
[Message 68] Liam: What if they planned this all along? Chris (Suspect 2) swapping shifts, Alex (Suspect 1) arguing with 9.  Bartender...?
[Message 69] Maya: You are thinking too hard. That is stuff out of movies.
[Message 70] Noah: It could be that Chris (Suspect 2) wanted the job from David (Security Guard).
[Message 71] Liam: Okay, maybe, but let's not rule anything out yet.
[Message 72] Maya: True. This is a weird case.
[Message 73] Ben: True.
[Message 74] Liam: Did anyone else get weird vibes when Chris (Suspect 2) was talking about David (Security Guard)?
[Message 75] Maya: Now that you mention it... yes.
[Message 76] Noah: Yes, he was very emotional.
[Message 77] Ben: I think that he was shocked that David (Security Guard) actually died!
[Message 78] Liam: Why do you say it like that, Ben? Like you knew something was going to happen?
[Message 79] Maya: Yes, that is right Ben!
[Message 80] Noah: Ben, are you okay?
[Message 81] Ben: What are you implying?
[Message 82] Liam: Just asking.
[Message 83] Maya: Yeah, all of us are just a little worried.
[Message 84] Noah: Agree!
[Message 85] Ben: Relax guys, I am fine! I was just saying it is a shame.
[Message 86] Liam: If you say so.
[Message 87] Maya: True.
[Message 88] Noah: We should focus on finding the real killer.
[Message 89] Ben: True.
[Message 90] Liam: Okay, new question. Did anyone see Alex (Suspect 1) with a rope recently?
[Message 91] Maya: Why a rope?
[Message 92] Noah: Asphyxiation by strangulation!
[Message 93] Ben: Woah!
[Message 94] Liam: Just a thought.
[Message 95] Maya: I think I saw him buying Asphyxiation by strangulation at the store!
[Message 96] Noah: When was this?
[Message 97] Ben: That is a bit of a coincidence.
[Message 98] Liam: I need to make a call. Will catch up later.
[Message 99] Maya: Okay!
[Message 100] Noah: Sure.
[Message 101] Ben: Bye.
[Message 102] Maya: So, what do we do now?
[Message 103] Noah: I do not know? Maybe call the cops!
[Message 104] Maya: They wont believe us!
[Message 105] Noah: Yes they will!
[Message 106] Maya: What if we are wrong and get someone innocent in trouble?
[Message 107] Noah: I think this needs to be done.
[Message 108] Maya: I guess.
[Message 109] Liam: (Back) Sorry about that, had to call someone. So back to the issue at hand. Where were we?
[Message 110] Maya: We were about to call the police.
[Message 111] Noah: Yes that is right Liam!
[Message 112] Ben: Are you crazy?
[Message 113] Liam: Why?
[Message 114] Maya: Why do you care?
[Message 115] Noah: What is wrong Ben?
[Message 116] Ben: This is stupid.
[Message 117] Liam: Maybe you should tell us what you know.
[Message 118] Maya: We are all friends here Ben!
[Message 119] Noah: Yes Ben, tell us.
[Message 120] Ben: Fine, I was there when it happened.
[Message 121] Liam: You were there, that means you saw something!
[Message 122] Maya: What did you see Ben?
[Message 123] Noah: Please tell us.
[Message 124] Ben: I saw Chris (Suspect 2) and Alex (Suspect 1) together.
[Message 125] Liam: Doing what?
[Message 126] Maya: Yes, what were they doing?
[Message 127] Noah: Were they fighting?
[Message 128] Ben: They were arguing with Mark (Bartender).
[Message 129] Liam: About what?
[Message 130] Maya: About the money?
[Message 131] Noah: About that job?
[Message 132] Ben: I could not hear. Then I left.
[Message 133] Liam: Liar!
[Message 134] Maya: He is definitely hiding something!
[Message 135] Noah: I think so too!
[Message 136] Ben: I have to go! Bye!
[Message 137] Liam: He is gone!
[Message 138] Maya: What do we do now?
[Message 139] Noah: I think we should go to the cops.
[Message 140] Liam: Agreed!
[Message 141] Maya: Are you sure?
[Message 142] Noah: Yes, I am!
[Message 143] Liam: Chris (Suspect 2) knew about the cameras right?
[Message 144] Maya: Maybe, why do you ask?
[Message 145] Noah: He probably told Alex (Suspect 1)!
[Message 146] Liam: I just realized something, if he hadn't fired him, none of this would have happened.
[Message 147] Maya: I do not understand?
[Message 148] Noah: They are all in it together.
[Message 149] Liam: Let us go find the cops!
[Message 150] Maya: Yes, let us go!

[Message 36] River: ""This is insane. I feel like someone wanted this.""
[Message 37] Kai: ""I called 911! They're on their way! This is a nightmare.""
[Message 38] Leo: ""Keep us updated, Kai. Please.""
[Message 39] Sam: ""I can't believe this is happening.""
[Message 40] River: ""I'm so shook right now.""
[Message 41] Kai: ""The firefighters are here. They're going in.""
[Message 42] Leo: ""Any news?""
[Message 43] Sam: ""Praying for Amelia.""
[Message 44] River: ""This is like something out of a movie.""
[Message 45] Kai: ""They... they found her. It's... it's bad.""
[Message 46] Leo: ""What? What do you mean bad?""
[Message 47] Sam: ""No... no way.""
[Message 48] River: ""Oh my god, no.""
[Message 49] Kai: ""She's gone. Amelia is gone.""
[Message 50] Leo: ""I... I don't know what to say. This is awful.""
[Message 51] Sam: ""I can't believe it. I just saw her last week.""
[Message 52] River: ""Remember when she tripped over her cat and spilled coffee everywhere? She laughed so hard.""
[Message 53] Kai: ""The police are here. They want to talk to me.""
[Message 54] Leo: ""Cooperate with them, Kai. Tell them everything you know.""
[Message 55] Sam: ""I’m so sorry Kai, she always spoke highly of you.""
[Message 56] River: ""Yeah, just tell them the truth.""
[Message 57] Kai: ""I will. This just doesn't make any sense. Why would anyone do this?""
[Message 58] Leo: ""Maybe it was an accident? A faulty wire or something?""
[Message 59] Sam: ""Doubtful, with that fire.""
[Message 60] River: ""Maybe someone was jealous of her success as a judge. Someone involved with religious extremism.""
[Message 61] Kai: ""I don't know... I just don't know. The Henderson case... that's the only thing that comes to mind. Someone must've hated the way she judged.""
[Message 62] Leo: ""Hate's a strong word. People get mad, but they don't usually resort to this.""
[Message 63] Sam: ""Leo's right. It's probably some random act of violence.""
[Message 64] River: ""Or maybe she knew too much about something. ""
[Message 65] Kai: ""I have to go. The police are waiting.""
[Message 66] Leo: ""Good luck, Kai. We're here for you.""
[Message 67] Sam: ""Keep us posted when you can.""
[Message 68] River: ""Stay strong.""
[Message 69] Leo: ""This is insane. I can't believe Amelia is really gone.""
[Message 70] Sam: ""Me neither. She was so young. Did she have any family in town?""
[Message 71] River: ""Just her brother, I think. This is going to destroy him.""
[Message 72] Leo: ""I saw River leaving the library around Dead of Night . It might be nothing, but thought I should mention it.""
[Message 73] Sam: ""We should organize something for her. A memorial or something.""
[Message 74] River: ""Yeah, that's a good idea. We need to honor her memory. I intended to stop by later and see if she needed anything before, but never did.""
[Message 75] Leo: ""We could set up a GoFundMe for her brother. Help with funeral expenses.""
[Message 76] Sam: ""That's a great idea, Leo. Let's do it. I can help with the wording.""
[Message 77] River: ""I'm in too. I can design the banner.""
[Message 78] Leo: ""This feels so surreal. Like a bad dream.""
[Message 79] Sam: ""It does. I keep expecting her to text me back about the pizza.""
[Message 80] River: ""Guys, the police are probably going to be asking us questions too. We need to be prepared.""
[Message 81] Leo: ""Prepared? What do you mean?""
[Message 82] Sam: ""Just... think about what you're going to say. You know, stick to the facts.""
[Message 83] River: ""Yeah, don't say anything that could be misinterpreted.""
[Message 84] Leo: ""Are you guys implying something? I have nothing to hide.""
[Message 85] Sam: ""No, of course not, Leo. Just being cautious.""
[Message 86] River: ""Yeah, same here. Just want to make sure we're all on the same page.""
[Message 87] Leo: ""Well, I was at home all night. Watching that terrible reality show.""
[Message 88] Sam: ""I was working on a project. I can show you the files.""
[Message 89] River: ""I was at the gym. Trying to de-stress. This is so awful. I can’t believe that person is going to going away for a long time for this""
[Message 90] Leo: ""Okay, good. Just wanted to clear the air. I'm still processing this whole thing.""
[Message 91] Sam: ""Me too. It's going to take a while to sink in.""
[Message 92] River: ""This whole situation is awful. I still can't believe it, hopefully police finds the culpable parties.""
[Message 93] Kai: ""They let me go. Said I was just a concerned friend. They're investigating the Henderson case and possible arson. Thanks for your support, guys.""
[Message 94] Leo: ""Glad you're okay, Kai. We're still here if you need anything.""
[Message 95] River: ""Yeah, Kai. We'll get through this together.""

[Message 75] Chloe: ""Finally.""
[Message 76] Ben: ""Good riddance.""
[Message 77] Kai: ""Seriously, what was his problem?""
[Message 78] Mara: ""I have no idea. He's been acting weird all day.""
[Message 79] Chloe: ""Maybe he's involved somehow?""
[Message 80] Ben: ""Could be. He was acting really suspicious.""
[Message 81] Kai: ""Let's not jump to conclusions.""
[Message 82] Mara: ""True. But something's definitely up with him.""

[Message 102] Mara: ""I was at the gym at Early Morning so I have nothing to hide.""
[Message 103] Chloe: ""I was at home sleeping. Its still so crazy to think that Abernathy is gone.""
[Message 104] Ben: ""Thanks guys. I appreciate that. This whole thing is messing with my head.""

[Message 106] Mara: ""Yeah, sleep well.""

[Message 108] Ben: ""Night guys.""

[Message 111] Mara: ""He's under a lot of pressure with the business and all.""
[Message 112] Chloe: ""True. But still...""
[Message 113] Kai: ""Let's just focus on telling the police what we know about Liam's argument with Abernathy.""
[Message 114] Mara: ""Good plan.""
[Message 115] Chloe: ""Agreed. Tomorrow morning.""
[Message 116] Kai: ""I'm still worried about what Abernathy was aware of about the corruption story.""
[Message 117] Mara: ""Abernathy was looking into something serious, that's for sure.""
[Message 118] Chloe: ""I heard he had proof, but I did not know he was going to make it public.""
[Message 119] Kai: ""We are next on this list.""
[Message 120] Mara: ""I hope that Abernathy's murderer gets severe punishment.""
[Message 121] Chloe: ""Hope they dont get the death penalty.""
[Message 122] Kai: ""Lets just hope this doesn't kill us, because if he hadn't exposed the truth, none of this would have happened.""
[Message 123] Mara: ""True, true""
[Message 124] Chloe: ""But someone should have called 911 after Abernathy was hurt, that makes them more culpable.""
[Message 125] Kai: ""I agree""
[Message 126] Mara: ""Agreed""
[Message 127] Chloe: ""I did see Kai buying some rope on the day that Abernathy was murdered.""
[Message 128] Kai: ""The rope was for my boat! I am an innocent man and it is a coincidence that I was buying it on that day.""
[Message 129] Mara: ""I believe you Kai""
[Message 130] Chloe: ""He was looking up how to make Useing a garrote online but then he tried to talk him out of it.""
[Message 131] Kai: ""I was just reading about it! You are twisting my words and it isnt fair!""
[Message 132] Mara: ""I dont care about any of this.""
[Message 133] Chloe: ""I see what you did, Mara! You never wanted Abernathy to expose the corrupiton. This means that you are working with Ben.""

[Message 2] Mark: Yeah, it's all over the news. Crazy. Two people dead.

[Message 3] Emily: I know, right? So awful. Anyone know who the victims were?

[Message 4] Sarah: They're saying a 16-year-old and a Corrections Officer.

[Message 5] David: Corrections Officer? Wow. That's intense. You think it was work-related?

[Message 6] Mark: Could be. Or just a random act of violence. Syracuse is getting rough.

[Message 7] Emily: I heard one was named Ashley. Poor Ashley. So young.

[Message 8] David: Ashley, huh? I don't think I knew her.

[Message 9] Sarah: I saw Carol leaving Doctor's Office around Sunset yesterday. Weird.

[Message 10] Mark: Carol? Seriously? What was she doing there?

[Message 11] Emily: She said she had an appointment for her foot. I think she mentioned something like physical therapy.

[Message 12] David: Carol and Ashley? Different crowds.

[Message 13] Sarah: That's what I thought. Just seemed odd. I went to visit my grandma, its been a while.

[Message 14] Mark: Yeah, Carol's got that clubfoot thing, right? Prob needed therapy.

[Message 15] Emily: Poor thing. I can't imagine living with that.

[Message 16] David: So, anything else on the news about it?

[Message 17] Sarah: They're not saying much. Just that they're investigating. They have few suspects.

[Message 18] Mark: Probably some psycho off the streets.

[Message 19] Emily: I hope they catch whoever did it.

[Message 20] David: Me too. So, anyone up for grabbing some pizza later?

[Message 21] Sarah: I'm in! Need something to take my mind off this.

[Message 22] Mark: Count me in. Emily?

[Message 23] Emily: Sure, why not.

[Message 24] David: Alright, cool. 7 PM at Nino's?

[Message 25] Sarah: Perfect.

[Message 26] Mark: See you guys then.

[Message 27] Emily: Later.

[Message 28] Sarah: Hey Mark, did you see Jason yesterday? I needed to ask him about something.

[Message 29] Mark: Nah, didn't see him. He's been pretty MIA lately.

[Message 30] David: I saw Jason at the bar. He was talking about how he hated Corrections Officers.

[Message 31] Emily: Oh dear. Why?

[Message 32] David: Apparently, one gave his brother a hard time in prison.

[Message 33] Sarah: That's... concerning.

[Message 34] Mark: Eh, Jason always exaggerates. He probably didn't mean anything by it.

[Message 35] Emily: Still, bad timing, right?

[Message 36] David: Yeah, you could say that. Anyway pizza?

[Message 37] Sarah: Let’s just try to relax at pizza, okay?

[Message 38] Mark: Agreed.

[Message 39] Emily: Okay.

[Message 40] Sarah: Hey Emily, did you know the other victim was named Sam?

[Message 41] Emily: Sam? No, I didn't. I thought it was just Ashley.

[Message 42] David: I heard Sam was trans.

[Message 43] Mark: Really? News travels fast.

[Message 44] Sarah: I saw Jason looking up how to make Drowning in a bathtub online last week.

[Message 45] Emily: Whoa, Sarah! Seriously? Why didn't you say something before?

[Message 46] David: What the hell, Sarah?! Now I'm starting to worry about what I said at the bar.

[Message 47] Mark: Hold on, hold on. Let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe he was just doing research for a story or something.

[Message 48] Sarah: He's not a writer, Mark. And I intended not to say anything, but this is going too far.

[Message 49] Emily: I'm feeling really uneasy now. I think we should tell the police about Jason.

[Message 50] David: Agreed. This is getting way too serious.

[Message 51] Mark: Alright, alright. But let's all go together, okay? Strength in numbers.

[Message 52] Sarah: Deal.

[Message 53] Emily: Okay. When?

[Message 54] David: How about tomorrow morning? First thing?

[Message 55] Sarah: Sounds good.

[Message 56] Mark: Fine by me.

[Message 57] Emily: Okay, see you all then.

[Message 58] Mark: Hey, Emily, can I ask you something in private?

[Message 59] Emily: Sure, what's up?

[Message 60] Mark: Do you really think Jason could have done it? I mean, I know he's got a temper, but murder?

[Message 61] Emily: I don't know, Mark. But Sarah's message freaked me out. And David's comment about the bar...

[Message 62] Mark: I know, it doesn't look good. But what if we're wrong? We could ruin his life.

[Message 63] Emily: And what if we're right and he hurts someone else? I don't know, Mark. I'm so confused.

[Message 64] Mark: Me too. Okay, let's just see what the police say tomorrow. We'll tell them everything we know, and they can decide.

[Message 65] Emily: Okay, that sounds fair.

[Message 66] Mark: Good. Thanks for listening, Emily.

[Message 67] Emily: Anytime, Mark. We're in this together.

[Message 68] Sarah: You guys still going for pizza later?

[Message 69] Mark: Nah, Emily and I are gonna pass. Too much on our minds.

[Message 70] Sarah: Oh. Okay. Well, you guys take care. David and I will go.

[Message 71] Emily: You too, Sarah.

[Message 72] David: See ya.

[Message 73] Sarah: I really didn’t like Sam. He was always being mean.

[Message 74] David: You were aware of what I was doing with Ashley last night, right?

[Message 75] Sarah: Hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 2] Liam: No way! What happened?

[Message 3] Kai: They found him at the bottom of the Tunnel last night.

[Message 4] Maya: OMG! seriously? That's awful!

[Message 5] Omar: Tunnel? Seriously? Was it an accident?

[Message 6] Kai: Cops are calling it suspicious. Someone pushed him, apparently. Late Evening.

[Message 7] Liam: Pushed? From the top? Who would do that? Judge Thompson was a legend.

[Message 8] Maya: He wasn't always liked. He was a pretty cynical guy, you know?

[Message 9] Omar: True. He made some enemies during his career. Remember the Miller case?

[Message 10] Kai: Guys, let's not speculate. Someone lost their life.

[Message 11] Liam: Right, sorry. Still, crazy stuff. Hope they catch who did it.

[Message 12] Maya: Me too. I was at the Tunnel yesterday afternoon, taking photos. Scary to think it happened there.

[Message 13] Omar: I saw River near the Tunnel yesterday Evening. Around 11 PM.

[Message 14] Kai: River? What were they doing there so late?

[Message 15] Omar: Don't know. Just saw them walking away. Seemed like they were rushing.

[Message 16] Liam: River? The religious extremist River? What would they want with Judge Thompson?

[Message 17] Maya: Maybe nothing. It's a public place.

[Message 18] Kai: I don't know, River has always been intense. Remember that time they wanted to silence that journalist?

[Message 19] Omar: Yeah, River is always talking about justice and divine retribution. I heard them say, Judge Thompson was obstructing the truth.

[Message 20] Liam: What? Did you hear them threaten the judge, or anything?

[Message 21] Omar: No, nothing like that. Just venting, I guess. But River did want to get rid of him, in his own way.

[Message 22] Maya: Guys, this is serious. We should tell the police what we know. Even if it's just a little bit.

[Message 23] Kai: Yeah, good idea. I'm going to call them now.

[Message 24] Liam: Me too. I'll tell them about seeing Omar getting Pushing from a height supplies earlier that day.

[Message 25] Omar: What? I didn't buy anything like that! I was getting groceries! You know I hate Tunnel!

[Message 26] Maya: Okay, guys, calm down. Let's not turn on each other.

[Message 27] Kai: Yeah, let's just focus on helping the police find who did this. Poor Judge Thompson... I was aware of his flaws but he didn't deserve that.

[Message 28] Liam: Did anyone hear about Judge's plan to expose corruption in the city? It's been silenced with him.

[Message 29] Omar: Maybe... or maybe it's just a coincidence, like you said.

[Message 30] River: Guys, this is terrible. I can't believe Judge Thompson is gone. I know some people will say I intended to harm him, but that's ridiculous. I'm cooperating fully with the police. Hope they find justice, and the culprit goes away for a long time for this.

[Message 43] River: ""I was scared! I knew how it would look! I just wanted to tell Alex that I will never be able to move past that rejection. I feel like that triggered this whole situation.""
[Message 44] Chloe: ""You need to tell the police this, River.""
[Message 45] River: ""I can't! They'll think I did it! I was looking up how to get Poisoning via inhalation online just yesterday""
[Message 46] Chloe: ""It will look worse if you don't.""
[Message 47] River: ""Fine, fine. I'll do it tomorrow. I just… I need some time to prepare myself.""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Everything okay? You seem stressed.""
[Message 49] Chloe: ""River just told me they went to see Alex at the Government Building today, around 2 PM. An hour before Alex was found.""
[Message 50] Liam: ""Holy crap! They didn't mention that earlier? ""
[Message 51] Chloe: ""Nope. They said they were scared. They knew they would be the prime suspect. ""
[Message 52] Liam: ""They should definitely tell the police. That's crazy.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""I know, I told them the same thing. They said they'd go tomorrow. I think River's terrified they will face capital punishment.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Hope Alex didn't suffer. The manager said he wants to get rid of River after hearing the confrontation from yesterday""
[Message 55] Chloe: ""Yeah me too. You're right, that's awful.""
[Message 56] River: ""Chloe, they just called me in for questioning. Wish me luck. I'm so nervous. I didn't do anything!""
[Message 57] Chloe: ""Good luck, River. Just be honest. Tell them everything.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""You hear anything from River yet?""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""Not yet. I'm getting worried.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Me too. I wonder if the cops are buying their story.""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""I don't know. It's all so messed up.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""This whole thing is crazy and now I am thinking that if River hadn't talked badly to Alex in that moment, Alex would be here with us.""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""It is crazy.""
[Message 64] River: ""Chloe, I'm being detained. They don't believe me. They said something about the route I took to the library and them getting camera footage. I might need a lawyer""
[Message 65] Chloe: ""Oh my god, River. I'm so sorry. I hope you get a good one.""

...","[Message 1] Liam: Hey guys, heard about what happened at the bookstore? Crazy.

[Message 2] Chloe: Yeah, Liam. Awful about Alex and Jordan...

[Message 3] Noah: Bookstore? What happened? I was off the grid all day.

[Message 4] Maya: Noah, seriously? Alex, the Corrections Officer, and Jordan, that Law Enforcement Officer, were found dead at Book Store. Poisoning via ingestion!

[Message 5] Noah: What?! No way! Jordan? I just saw him yesterday. What the hell happened?

[Message 6] Ethan: Heard it was Poisoning via ingestion. Pretty messed up.

[Message 7] Chloe: Ethan, you seem awfully calm about this.

[Message 8] Ethan: Just saying what I heard, Chloe. Everyone's talking about it.

[Message 9] Liam: Anyone know any details? Police aren't saying much.

[Message 10] Maya: Apparently, it happened Afternoon.

[Message 11] Noah: Afternoon? I was at the gym then. I can prove it.

[Message 12] Chloe: Nobody's accusing you, Noah. Relax.

[Message 13] Liam: Chloe's right, man. Just trying to piece things together.

[Message 14] Ethan: I was at work all day. Clocked in and out.

[Message 15] Maya: I heard Alex was giving someone trouble. Something about exposing a secret?

[Message 16] Liam: Maya, where'd you hear that?

[Message 17] Maya: Just rumors, Liam. Going around.

[Message 18] Noah: Alex always seemed so withdrawn. Hard to imagine him causing trouble.

[Message 19] Chloe: Jordan was always anxious, but a good kid. This is terrible.

[Message 20] Ethan: Jordan was supposed to give me a ride this week. Now he's gone.

[Message 21] Liam: Ethan, I'm really sorry, man.

[Message 22] Ethan: Thanks, Liam.

[Message 23] Maya: Did anyone see anything suspicious around the bookstore lately?

[Message 24] Chloe: I saw David hanging around there a couple of days ago. He looked really shifty.

[Message 25] Liam: David? I thought he moved away.

[Message 26] Chloe: Maybe he's back. Just saying, he was there.

[Message 27] Noah: David always had a thing against Alex. Hated him.

[Message 28] Ethan: I saw Sarah buying something at the store the other day, but I couldn't see what. It seemed like some kind of a Poisoning via ingestion.

[Message 29] Liam: Sarah? Why would she do that?

[Message 30] Maya: I don't know her very well.

[Message 31] Chloe: She's always been kind of odd.

[Message 32] Noah: Maybe she felt like she was doing them a favor? Ending their suffering?

[Message 33] Liam: Noah, that's a messed up thing to say.

[Message 34] Noah: Just thinking out loud, Liam. Jeez.

[Message 35] Ethan: I heard Jordan had a gambling problem. Could be related.

[Message 36] Maya: A gambling problem? I didn't know that.

[Message 37] Chloe: Me neither.

[Message 38] Liam: This is all just speculation. Let's not jump to conclusions.

[Message 39] Ethan: True. But still, something feels off.

[Message 40] Maya: I agree.

[Message 41] Noah: Anyone know if they found anything at the scene?

[Message 42] Chloe: Police aren't releasing anything.

[Message 43] Liam: We should just let them do their job.

[Message 44] Ethan: Yeah, but what if they miss something?

[Message 45] Maya: They're going to investigate thoroughly. I'm sure.

[Message 46] Noah: Still can't believe it. Poor Alex and Jordan.

[Message 47] Chloe: It's just so senseless.

[Message 48] Liam: Anyway, I gotta go. Catch you guys later.

[Message 49] Chloe: Bye, Liam.

[Message 50] Noah: Later.

[Message 51] Ethan: See ya.

[Message 52] Maya: Bye.

[Message 53] Ethan: Thinking about going to the bookstore tomorrow. Leaving some flowers.

[Message 54] Maya: That's a nice idea, Ethan.

[Message 55] Chloe: I might join you.

[Message 56] Noah: Count me in.

[Message 57] Ethan: Cool.

[Message 58] Maya: Maybe we can all grab coffee afterward?

[Message 59] Chloe: Sounds good.

[Message 60] Noah: I am in too.

[Message 61] Ethan: This is crazy how this happened at Afternoon, I heard.

[Message 62] Chloe: You know, it’s wild that Jordan was going to testify in that case.

[Message 63] Noah: Yeah, he was supposed to do that, someone needed to do it I think

[Message 64] Maya: His shouting probably provoked him.

[Message 65] Ethan: She said she wanted to get rid of him.

        *   **Attendant/Extenuating Circumstances:** References to factors that could influence culpability (e.g., victim's age in a statutory rape hypothetical, potential self-defense claims, evidence of duress, victim's own aggression leading to the crime.)

...","[Message 1] CHLOE: OMG did you guys hear about what happened at Playground?!
[Message 2] SAM: Yeah, it's all over the news. Crazy. What a tragedy.
[Message 3] JENNA: I know, right? So messed up.
[Message 4] CHLOE: They're saying it was that taxi driver, right? The one they called 'Vee'?
[Message 5] SAM: And that security guard... was it... Alex?
[Message 6] JENNA: Yeah, Alex. Poor kid. So young.
[Message 7] CHLOE: I saw Vee arguing with someone there last week. Big fight.
[Message 8] SAM: Really? Who?
[Message 9] CHLOE: I couldn't really see. It was getting dark. Just some angry shouting.
[Message 10] JENNA: This is awful. My cousin knew Alex.
[Message 11] CHLOE: Ugh, that's terrible, Jenna.
[Message 12] SAM: I need to finish this report for work. Talk later?
[Message 13] JENNA: Yeah, me too. So much to do.
[Message 14] CHLOE: Okay, later.
[Message 15] DEREK: Hey guys, anyone know if The Grind is open late tonight? Need coffee.
[Message 16] LORI: I think they close at 10. Why so late at work?
[Message 17] DEREK: Big project. Deadline looming.
[Message 18] LORI: Good luck! Hope you get some sleep.
[Message 19] DEREK: Thanks, I'll need it.
[Message 20] CHLOE: Anyone seen my blue sweater? I can't find it anywhere.
[Message 21] JENNA: Check your closet?
[Message 22] CHLOE: Already did.
[Message 23] SAM: Maybe you left it at the gym?
[Message 24] CHLOE: Good idea, I'll check tomorrow.
[Message 25] LORI: Hey, did you guys hear about that awful thing at the Playground?
[Message 26] DEREK: Yeah, I saw it on the news. Horrible.
[Message 27] LORI: Apparently, Vee was causing problems for everyone. It was only a matter of time, really.
[Message 28] DEREK: That's messed up, LORI. The manager didn't deserve it.
[Message 29] LORI: I didn't say they did! Just saying things were tense.
[Message 30] DEREK: Still...
[Message 31] JENNA: Guys, can we not talk about this right now? It's upsetting.
[Message 32] CHLOE: Yeah, please.
[Message 33] DEREK: Sorry.
[Message 34] LORI: Me too.
[Message 35] SAM: Movie night at my place Friday? Anyone in?
[Message 36] CHLOE: I'm in!
[Message 37] JENNA: Maybe. Depends on work.
[Message 38] DEREK: Sounds good.
[Message 39] LORI: I can bring snacks!
[Message 40] SAM: Perfect!
[Message 41] DEREK: Anyone know anything about the investigation?
[Message 42] LORI: Heard they're looking at everyone who was around there that day.
[Message 43] DEREK: Makes sense.
[Message 44] JENNA: Hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 45] CHLOE: Me too.
[Message 46] SAM: Seriously.
[Message 47] LORI: I saw Tanya near Playground that day.
[Message 48] DEREK: Tanya? Why would she be there?
[Message 49] LORI: I don't know. Just saw her.
[Message 50] JENNA: Tanya is weird.
[Message 51] CHLOE: Yeah, she's always been kinda off.
[Message 52] SAM: Let's not start rumors.
[Message 53] DEREK: Agreed.
[Message 54] LORI: Just saying what I saw! Don't shoot the messenger.
[Message 55] JENNA: Hey, anyone know a good mechanic? My car's making a weird noise.
[Message 56] CHLOE: I know one. I'll text you his number.
[Message 57] JENNA: Thanks!
[Message 58] SAM: I think Chris knows a good one too. He knows everything about cars.
[Message 59] CHLOE: Oh yeah! Chris is the man.
[Message 60] DEREK: Maybe Alex got caught in the crossfire.
[Message 61] LORI: Don't say that!
[Message 62] DEREK: Just a thought. They must go to away for a long time.
[Message 63] JENNA: Stop speculating, Derek.
[Message 64] CHLOE: Seriously, dude. Not cool.
[Message 65] SAM: Lay off, Derek.
[Message 66] DEREK: Sorry, sorry. Just trying to make sense of it.
[Message 67] LORI: It's senseless.
[Message 68] JENNA: Exactly.
[Message 69] CHLOE: What's everyone doing for dinner tonight?
[Message 70] SAM: Pizza?
[Message 71] JENNA: Sounds good.
[Message 72] DEREK: I'm in.
[Message 73] LORI: Me too!
[Message 74] CHLOE: Awesome!
[Message 75] DEREK: Anyone know when the funeral is?
[Message 76] LORI: I think it's next week. I'll check.
[Message 77] JENNA: It will be at st. Francis church.
[Message 78] CHLOE: Okay.
[Message 79] SAM: I want to pay my respects.
[Message 80] DEREK: Me too.
[Message 81] LORI: I intended to go.
[Message 82] JENNA: We should all go together.
[Message 83] CHLOE: Good idea.
[Message 84] SAM: Definitely.
[Message 85] DEREK: Okay.
[Message 86] LORI: Tanya always hated 3.  Taxi Driver, didn't she?
[Message 87] DEREK: Where is this coming from?
[Message 88] LORI: Just something I remember her saying once. It's really not that deep.
[Message 89] JENNA: This is getting weird again.
[Message 90] CHLOE: Seriously, LORI.
[Message 91] SAM: Stop it.
[Message 92] DEREK: Enough.
[Message 93] LORI: Fine, fine. Sorry.
[Message 94] JENNA: What movie are we watching Friday?
[Message 95] CHLOE: Let's watch that new horror one!
[Message 96] SAM: I'm down!
[Message 97] DEREK: Sure.
[Message 98] LORI: I hate horror movies!
[Message 99] JENNA: We can pick something else then.
[Message 100] CHLOE: Okay, what do you want to watch, LORI?
[Message 101] SAM: Something not too scary.
[Message 102] DEREK: Comedy?
[Message 103] LORI: Yeah, a comedy would be great.
[Message 104] JENNA: Let's decide later.
[Message 105] CHLOE: Sounds good.
[Message 106] SAM: Agreed.
[Message 107] DEREK: Okay.
[Message 108] LORI: Hey Derek, did you get that thing I asked you for?
[Message 109] DEREK: Not yet. I'll get it tomorrow.
[Message 110] LORI: Okay, thanks!
[Message 111] JENNA: Anyone else feeling super tired today?
[Message 112] CHLOE: Me! I could sleep for a week.
[Message 113] SAM: Same.
[Message 114] DEREK: Yeah, I'm dragging.
[Message 115] LORI: Must be the weather.
[Message 116] JENNA: Maybe.
[Message 117] CHLOE: Coffee time!
[Message 118] SAM: Yes!
[Message 119] DEREK: I'm on my third cup already.
[Message 120] LORI: Wow!
[Message 121] CHLOE: My mom always told me to call 911 when you see car accident.
[Message 122] SAM: Anyone talked to Chris lately?
[Message 123] JENNA: Not recently. Why?
[Message 124] CHLOE: Just wondering.
[Message 125] SAM: He's been acting weird.
[Message 126] DEREK: How so?
[Message 127] LORI: I heard he was looking up how to make Car accident (vehicular homicide) online
[Message 128] JENNA: What?! Seriously?
[Message 129] CHLOE: That's messed up!
[Message 130] SAM: I don't believe it.
[Message 131] DEREK: That can't be true.
[Message 132] LORI: I'm just saying what I heard!
[Message 133] JENNA: Where did you hear that?
[Message 134] CHLOE: Yeah, LORI, spill!
[Message 135] SAM: Come on, LORI.
[Message 136] DEREK: This is serious.
[Message 137] LORI: Okay, okay. It was just a rumor. I don't know if it's true.
[Message 138] JENNA: A rumor from where?
[Message 139] CHLOE: Yeah, give us a source!
[Message 140] SAM: LORI!
[Message 141] DEREK: We need to know.
[Message 142] LORI: Fine! It was...Tanya. She told me Chris was acting strange and looking up weird stuff.
[Message 143] JENNA: So Tanya is spreading rumors about Chris?
[Message 144] CHLOE: Great. Just what we needed. More drama.
[Message 145] SAM: Tanya is so unreliable.
[Message 146] DEREK: Agreed.
[Message 147] LORI: I didn't know if it was true or not! I was just...sharing.
[Message 148] JENNA: Sharing unfounded accusations.
[Message 149] CHLOE: Thanks a lot, LORI.
[Message 150] SAM: Ugh.
[Message 151] DEREK: I'm going to call Chris.
[Message 152] LORI: What? No! Don't!
[Message 153] JENNA: Why not?
[Message 154] CHLOE: Yeah, LORI, why not? Something you're not telling us?
[Message 155] SAM: Spill it!
[Message 156] DEREK: What's going on, LORI?
[Message 157] LORI: Look, I just... I saw Chris near the Playground that day too.
[Message 158] JENNA: Oh my god.
[Message 159] CHLOE: Seriously?
[Message 160] SAM: LORI...
[Message 161] DEREK: You knew this and didn't say anything?!
[Message 162] LORI: I was scared! What if I was wrong?
[Message 163] JENNA: Scared of what?
[Message 164] CHLOE: LORI, you need to tell the police EVERYTHING.
[Message 165] SAM: NOW.
[Message 166] DEREK: This is beyond messed up.
[Message 167] LORI: But... Tanya told me not to say anything! She said it could make things worse for everyone.
[Message 168] JENNA: What?! Tanya told you not to report a potential suspect in a double homicide?!
[Message 169] CHLOE: Tanya is involved in this somehow.
[Message 170] SAM: This is insane.
[Message 171] DEREK: LORI, listen to me. You need to go to the police RIGHT NOW and tell them everything you know about Chris and Tanya. Understand?
[Message 172] LORI: But...
[Message 173] JENNA: No buts, LORI. This is serious.
[Message 174] CHLOE: Do it now!
[Message 175] SAM: Before it's too late.
[Message 176] DEREK: We'll go with you.
[Message 177] LORI: Okay... okay, I'll do it. I was aware and should have say something.
[Message 178] JENNA: Good. We'll meet you there.
[Message 179] CHLOE: Stay safe.
[Message 180] SAM: Call us when you're done.

...","[Message 1] Maya: Hey, have you guys heard about what happened down at Street Corner?
[Message 2] Ben: Yeah, it’s all over the news. Something about two journalists?
[Message 3] Chloe: It’s awful. I can’t believe it.
[Message 4] Maya: I know, right? I was just there yesterday getting coffee.
[Message 5] Ben: Wild. You were lucky.
[Message 6] Chloe: Did they say who it was?
[Message 7] Maya: Something about David and Mark.
[Message 8] Ben: David? The one who worked at the Atlanta Sun?
[Message 9] Maya: Yeah, that’s him. And Mark, I think he was a freelancer.
[Message 10] Chloe: I met Mark once at a conference. Seemed really quiet.
[Message 11] Ben: David was always kind of cynical, from what I heard.
[Message 12] Maya: I heard that too. Anyway, I'm thinking of visiting a relative out of town.
[Message 13] Ben: Good idea. You were lucky. It would be hard to cope if I were that close.
[Message 14] Chloe: That's random. But smart, Maya.
[Message 15] Maya: So, anyway, anyone know anything else about what happened?
[Message 16] Ben: Just what they're saying on TV. Drowning in a bathtub. Gruesome.
[Message 17] Chloe: Seriously awful.
[Message 18] Maya: Yeah, that’s messed up.
[Message 19] Ben: Hey, Chloe, weren’t you supposed to meet David last week for coffee?
[Message 20] Chloe: Uh, yeah, but he cancelled last minute. Said he was busy.
[Message 21] Maya: Oh really?
[Message 22] Chloe: Yeah, why?
[Message 23] Ben: No reason, just curious.
[Message 24] Chloe: Creep. Just kidding.
[Message 25] Maya: Speaking of coffee, anyone want to grab some later?
[Message 26] Ben: I’m in. Need to get out of the house.
[Message 27] Chloe: Can't. I'm helping my grandma with some stuff.
[Message 28] Maya: Okay, another time then.
[Message 29] Ben: Sounds good.
[Message 30] Chloe: I keep thinking about their families. Just terrible.
[Message 31] Maya: Yeah, definitely.
[Message 32] Ben: So, you guys think they'll catch who did it?
[Message 33] Chloe: They have to. Atlanta PD isn't exactly incompetent.
[Message 34] Maya: Hope they catch them soon. Makes me nervous.
[Message 35] Ben: Agreed. Anyway, gotta run. See you later, Maya.
[Message 36] Maya: Later, Ben.
[Message 37] Chloe: Bye.
[Message 38] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Hey, you think Chloe is acting weird?
[Message 39] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) How so?
[Message 40] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) I don’t know, just seems a little…off. Asking a lot of questions.
[Message 41] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Maybe she’s just shocked, like the rest of us.
[Message 42] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Maybe. But she was supposed to meet with David...and he died Mid-Morning.
[Message 43] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Okay, that IS kinda weird. But let’s not jump to conclusions.
[Message 44] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) True. I'm still going out of town just in case.
[Message 45] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Yeah, you're right. Gotta be careful.
[Message 46] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Hey Ben, you free to chat?
[Message 47] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Uh, yeah, what’s up?
[Message 48] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Did you know that Mark was working on a big story about corruption in the city?
[Message 49] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) No way, really? That could be it.
[Message 50] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) I heard someone saying he was getting close to uncovering something big. Intended to publish soon.
[Message 51] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) That’s insane. Maybe that's why Maya is acting random.
[Message 52] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) I think it makes sense for sure. You should call your relative before anything happens to you!
[Message 53] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Yeah, thanks for the heads up, Chloe.
[Message 54] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Of course. Be safe.
[Message 55] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Hey, I wanted to ask you something about David.
[Message 56] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Sure, what's up?
[Message 57] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Did he ever mention anything about… I don’t know… being afraid of anyone?
[Message 58] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) No, never. He was pretty private, though. Why?
[Message 59] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Just wondering. It’s all so strange.
[Message 60] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Tell me about it.
[Message 61] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Well, gotta go. Later!
[Message 62] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Bye!
[Message 63] Ben: Guys, just saw something crazy.
[Message 64] Maya: What?
[Message 65] Chloe: Spill!
[Message 66] Ben: There was a police car outside Maya’s apartment building.
[Message 67] Chloe: No way! What’s happening?
[Message 68] Maya: Oh my god. I need to go.
[Message 69] Ben: Be careful!
[Message 70] Chloe: Keep us updated!
[Message 71] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) See? I told you she was acting weird!
[Message 72] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Yeah, maybe you’re right. But why would she do it?
[Message 73] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) I don’t know, maybe David found out something about her?
[Message 74] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Like what?
[Message 75] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) I don’t know! Maybe she owed him money? Maybe he was gonna expose something about her past?
[Message 76] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Anything is possible at this point. I'm at my relative's house now. I'll keep you posted.
[Message 77] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Stay safe!
[Message 78] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Hey, can you talk?
[Message 79] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Yeah, what’s going on? You okay?
[Message 80] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) The police were here because someone reported a suspicious package outside my door. It was nothing.
[Message 81] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Wow, that’s crazy. Are you sure it was nothing?
[Message 82] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Yeah, they checked it out. Just some kind of mix up.
[Message 83] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Who would do that to you?
[Message 84] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) I have no idea! Probably just some random prank.
[Message 85] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
[Message 86] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) I'm leaving town to visit my grandmother.
[Message 87] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Good idea. Stay safe!
[Message 88] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Thanks, you too.
[Message 89] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Everything okay? Ben said the cops were at your place.
[Message 90] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Yeah, it was nothing. Just a false alarm.
[Message 91] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Still, scary!
[Message 92] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) I know, right?
[Message 93] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) I hope they catch whoever did this to David and Mark soon. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 94] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Me too. It's awful.
[Message 95] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Okay, well, let me know if you need anything!
[Message 96] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Thanks, Chloe. I appreciate it.
[Message 97] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) You haven't heard from Maya, have you?
[Message 98] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) She said it was a false alarm at her place. Why?
[Message 99] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Just checking. Things aren't adding up.
[Message 100] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Yeah, tell me about it.
[Message 101] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Did David have enemies?
[Message 102] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) You know, I think he might have fired someone recently. A trans man I think.
[Message 103] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Interesting....Very interesting.
[Message 104] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Let me know if you need anything.
[Message 105] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 106] Maya: Hey guys, I'm at my grandma's. Super boring here.
[Message 107] Ben: At least you're safe.
[Message 108] Chloe: Yeah, that's what matters.
[Message 109] Maya: True. How's everything in Atlanta?
[Message 110] Ben: Still tense. No news on the case.
[Message 111] Chloe: Everyone's on edge.
[Message 112] Maya: I bet. Wish I could help somehow.
[Message 113] Ben: Just stay put and be safe.
[Message 114] Chloe: Exactly.
[Message 115] Maya: Okay, will do.
[Message 116] Ben: Did either of you know David well?
[Message 117] Chloe: Not really. Just met him that one time.
[Message 118] Maya: I knew him a little better. We worked on a project together once.
[Message 119] Ben: What was he like?
[Message 120] Maya: He was okay, pretty intense about his work. Why?
[Message 121] Ben: Just trying to piece things together.
[Message 122] Chloe: Me too. It's like a puzzle with missing pieces.
[Message 123] Maya: Totally.
[Message 124] Ben: So, nothing seemed off about him? No one threatening him or anything?
[Message 125] Maya: Not that I know of. He was always complaining about deadlines, though.
[Message 126] Chloe: Deadlines are a killer.
[Message 127] Maya: For real. Anyway, gotta go. Grandma needs help with something.
[Message 128] Ben: Okay, talk later.
[Message 129] Chloe: Bye!
[Message 130] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) I just remembered something. Maya was looking up how to make Drowning in a bathtub online a few weeks ago. She said it was for a story she was writing.
[Message 131] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) No way! That's insane!
[Message 132] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) I know, right?
[Message 133] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) We need to tell the police!
[Message 134] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) I don't know...what if we're wrong?
[Message 135] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) We can't take that chance! These were his actions around the time of the crime!
[Message 136] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Okay, okay. You're right. I'll call them.
[Message 137] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Be careful, Ben!
[Message 138] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) You too, Chloe.
[Message 139] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Hey, could you do me a huge favor?

[Message 142] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) What? Why would I do that?
[Message 143] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) It's just… I don't want the police digging through my personal stuff. Please?
[Message 144] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) I don't know, Maya…
[Message 145] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Please, Chloe! It would really help me out!

[Message 10] Maya: ""Maybe that’s connected?""

[Message 20] Maya: ""Right, sorry. Just…spooked.""
[Message 21] Liam: ""So, anyone know anything about 1.  Law Enforcement Officer that might help?""
[Message 22] Chloe: ""Heard rumors she was involved in some shady stuff. Drug busts maybe?""
[Message 23] Ben: ""Yeah, I heard that too. Whispers around town.""
[Message 24] Maya: ""Shady stuff could mean enemies. Lots of them.""
[Message 25] Liam: ""True. Okay, let's try to stay calm and think logically.""
[Message 26] Chloe: ""Easier said than done. I keep thinking about how scared she must have been. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 27] Ben: ""Yeah, it's messed up.""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Has anyone talked to Amelia? She works near Temple.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Good idea. Let me text her.""
[Message 30] Liam: ""She said she didn't see anything unusual. Just got to work at 8 am.""
[Message 31] Chloe: ""Damn. So, nobody saw anything?""
[Message 32] Ben: ""I saw Karen buying something weird at the hardware store yesterday. Looked like Electrocution supplies.""
[Message 33] Maya: ""Karen? Seriously? Why would she need that?""
[Message 34] Liam: ""Maybe she was fixing something? Let’s not jump to conclusions, Ben. That sounds really bad.""
[Message 35] Ben: ""Just saying what I saw. She looked really stressed too. Always hated 1.  Law Enforcement Officer. They had beef.""
[Message 36] Chloe: ""Beef? What kind of beef?""
[Message 37] Ben: ""Karen said 1.  Law Enforcement Officer cost her a promotion a few months ago.""

[Message 40] Chloe: ""True. What about Jason? He's always broke. Maybe he tried to rob 1.  Law Enforcement Officer?""
[Message 41] Maya: ""Jason? He's a sweetheart, though. I can't imagine it. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there""
[Message 42] Liam: ""Broke doesn't equal murderer. He always looks for an opportunity.""
[Message 43] Ben: ""He *was* complaining about needing money yesterday. Said he was desperate.""
[Message 44] Chloe: ""Desperate enough to Electrocution someone? Ugh.""
[Message 45] Maya: ""This is getting us nowhere. We're just guessing.""
[Message 46] Liam: ""True. Let’s focus on facts. Electrocution is unusual. Someone knew what they were doing.""
[Message 47] Chloe: ""Maybe someone wanted to get rid of 1.  Law Enforcement Officer because of something she knew.""
[Message 48] Ben: ""Like what? Drugs? Corruption?""
[Message 49] Maya: ""Could be anything. This is Detroit. The city can be dark sometimes.""
[Message 50] Liam: ""Okay, new plan. Let's all think about who might have benefited from 1.  Law Enforcement Officer's death.""
[Message 51] Chloe: ""Good call.""
[Message 52] Ben: ""I'm drawing a blank.""
[Message 53] Maya: ""Me too. Except maybe Karen…""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Guys, stop focusing on Karen. It's not helping.""
[Message 55] Chloe: ""Fine. What about the fact that she was buying Electrocution at the store?""
[Message 56] Ben: ""Maybe it was an impulsive act of rage.""
[Message 57] Maya: ""Maybe someone paid someone else to do it.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Okay, getting too conspiracy-theory. Keep it grounded.""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""Sorry, just thinking out loud.""
[Message 60] Ben: ""So, we wait for the cops to figure it out?""
[Message 61] Maya: ""Pretty much. Unless someone knows something they're not telling us.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""Nobody should be hiding anything. This is about justice for 1.  Law Enforcement Officer.""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""Agreed. It's scary to think someone we know could be involved.""
[Message 64] Ben: ""Yeah, super messed up.""
[Message 65] Maya: ""I need a drink. This is giving me a headache.""
[Message 66] Liam: ""Me too. Maybe we should all meet up later? Talk this through in person?""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""Sounds good. Where?""
[Message 68] Ben: ""Joe's Diner?""
[Message 69] Maya: ""Too soon. Maybe somewhere else?""
[Message 70] Liam: ""Okay, The Rusty Mug?""
[Message 71] Chloe: ""Perfect. See you guys there around 8?""

[Message 79] Liam: ""Something's not sitting right with me. About Ben…""
[Message 80] Maya: ""What about him?""
[Message 81] Liam: ""He seemed a little too eager to point the finger at Karen, don't you think?""
[Message 82] Maya: ""Hmm, maybe. He is not very trustworthy""
[Message 83] Liam: ""Plus, him being at Temple yesterday…and knowing about the Electrocution supplies…""
[Message 84] Maya: ""Okay, you're making me nervous.""
[Message 85] Liam: ""Just saying, keep your eyes open tonight.""
[Message 86] Maya: ""Will do. You too. Night.""
[Message 87] Liam: ""Night.""
[Message 88] Chloe: ""Hey Liam, you still up?""
[Message 89] Liam: ""Yeah, just thinking. What's up?""
[Message 90] Chloe: ""I looked up Karen's alibi. She was at home all night. Watched movies with her husband.""
[Message 91] Liam: ""So Ben was lying?""
[Message 92] Chloe: ""Seems that way. Why would he do that?""
[Message 93] Liam: ""That's what I'm trying to figure out. See you at The Rusty Mug?""
[Message 94] Chloe: ""Yeah. Something is very wrong. He said he wanted to get rid of him.""
[Message 95] Liam: ""Agreed. See you soon. Act normal.""
[Message 96] Chloe: ""Will do.""
[Message 97] Ben: ""Hey, running a little late. Traffic's a nightmare.""

[Message 101] Chloe: ""Liam, check this out - I just saw Ben's car on a traffic cam near Temple at Dawn.""
[Message 102] Liam: ""What? Screenshot it!""
[Message 103] Chloe: ""Sent. It's grainy, but it's definitely his car.""
[Message 104] Liam: ""He lied about being asleep. He intended on doing something.""
[Message 105] Maya: ""Okay, this is bad. Really bad. The police are going to be so mad.""
[Message 106] Chloe: ""The cops need to see this. Like, now.""
[Message 107] Liam: ""Agreed. Maya, call them. Chloe and I will keep an eye on Ben when he gets here.""
[Message 108] Maya: ""On it. Be careful, both of you.""
[Message 109] Chloe: ""We will. He probably saw something, and her shouting probably provoked him. None of this would have happened if he did call 911.""
[Message 110] Liam: ""Exactly. Let's get justice for 1.  Law Enforcement Officer.""

...","[Message 1] Maya: Hey guys, did you hear about what happened at the venue last night?

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, it's all over the news. Brutal.

[Message 3] Chloe: I can't believe it. Poor Alex and David.

[Message 4] Ben: Who would do something like that?

[Message 5] Maya: No clue. I was home all evening watching reruns.

[Message 6] Liam: I was at that dive bar downtown. Can't remember much after 10 pm.

[Message 7] Chloe: I had dinner with my parents. Pretty boring night.

[Message 8] Ben: I was working late. Signed a huge deal, actually.

[Message 9] Maya: Congrats, Ben!

[Message 10] Ben: Thanks, Maya. Stressful, though. Needed to blow off some steam after.

[Message 11] Liam: Speaking of stress, anyone see Sarah acting weird lately?

[Message 12] Chloe: Sarah? How so?

[Message 13] Liam: Just seemed… off. On edge. Especially when David’s name came up.

[Message 14] Maya: David? Why David specifically?

[Message 15] Liam: I don't know. It’s like she intended something for him. Maybe jealousy over success?

[Message 16] Chloe: Maybe she was just tired. She's been working long hours too.

[Message 17] Ben: Did anyone actually *see* anything last night?

[Message 18] Maya: Not me. Venue is nowhere near my place.

[Message 19] Liam: I saw Sarah leave the building around Evening. Looked like she purposefully wanted to be sneaky.

[Message 20] Chloe: Liam, don't go pointing fingers without evidence.

[Message 21] Liam: I'm just saying what I saw.

[Message 22] Ben: I heard Alex was getting some heat for his activism lately. Could be related.

[Message 23] Maya: That's true. He was always ruffling feathers.

[Message 24] Chloe: Still doesn’t justify anything.

[Message 25] Liam: What time did you see Sarah leave, Liam?

[Message 26] Liam: Around 8:30, maybe 9. I was heading to my car.

[Message 27] Chloe: The news said it happened much later.

[Message 28] Ben: Any word on what the police found?

[Message 29] Maya: Just that it was a stabbing. Horrible.

[Message 30] Liam: Did Alex have any enemies? Besides the people his activism upset?

[Message 31] Chloe: I don't know. He kept to himself mostly.

[Message 32] Ben: David was a journalist, right? Maybe he was working on a story that someone didn't want him to publish.

[Message 33] Maya: Good point, Ben. That's a solid motive.

[Message 34] Liam: Sarah was always complaining about how David treated her at work. Said he undermined her constantly.

[Message 35] Chloe: Understood now, I know what you mean Liam. I saw Sarah buying Stabbing with a knife at the store some time ago. What I thought was for cooking but now it seems like a joke.

[Message 36] Ben: This is getting heavy. Let’s not jump to conclusions.

[Message 37] Maya: Agreed. Let the police do their job.

[Message 38] Liam: Yeah, but someone needs to be held accountable. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 39] Chloe: I hope they catch whoever did this soon. It's terrifying.

[Message 40] Ben: I can't focus on work. This is all so messed up.

[Message 41] Maya: Maybe we should all get together later, just to… I don't know, support each other?

[Message 42] Liam: Good idea, Maya. I’m in.

[Message 43] Chloe: Me too. But let’s not talk about this the whole time.

[Message 44] Ben: Deal. I'll bring the beer.

[Message 45] Maya: So, 7 pm at my place?

[Message 46] Liam: Sounds good.

[Message 47] Chloe: See you guys then.

[Message 48] Ben: Later.

[Message 49] Maya: Hey, unrelated, but did anyone see that meteor shower last week? It was amazing!

[Message 50] Liam: Nah, I missed it. Was too busy.

[Message 51] Chloe: Me neither. Been swamped.

[Message 52] Ben: I caught a glimpse of it. Pretty cool.

[Message 53] Maya: Okay, back to the venue. I wonder if they had security cameras?

[Message 54] Liam: Of course they did. Probably useless footage though.

[Message 55] Chloe: Maybe not. Hopefully, they got something.

[Message 56] Ben: They need solid evidence to prove anything.

[Message 57] Maya: True. This whole thing is just…surreal. I can't imagine what their families are going through.

[Message 58] Liam: I heard David had a ton of debt.

[Message 59] Chloe: Where did you hear that, Liam?

[Message 60] Liam: Just around. It could be he was the one who started it all. Her shouting probably provoked him.

[Message 61] Ben: Doesn't make it okay to kill him.

[Message 62] Maya: Guys, seriously. Let's just wait for the police.

[Message 63] Liam: I’m just trying to make sense of it all.

[Message 64] Chloe: Me too. It's just hard to process.

[Message 65] Ben: Agreed. See you all tonight.

[Message 7] Alex: ""Definitely. I need a distraction. This whole thing is messing with my head. The coffee shop is no longer safe.""

[Message 9] Alex: ""Nope, haven't seen Dale in ages. Maybe try texting him?""
[Message 10] Jordan: ""Yeah, good idea. Say, isn't Kai the new barista there? Wonder if they saw anything.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Could be. Kai is always so quiet though. Hard to get a word out of them.""
[Message 12] Jordan: ""True. Heard Kai needed money bad. Maybe the victims had money?""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Woah, hold on. You think Kai did it? I also heard that Dale was looking up how to make a really sharp blade online. So maybe Dale did it?""
[Message 14] Jordan: ""I'm not saying that, just... people do crazy things. Dale always hated Brenda. Remember how she fired him last year?""
[Message 15] Alex: ""That was rough. But murder? Seems extreme. Dale's always been a bit unstable though...""
[Message 16] Jordan: ""Unstable is an understatement. I heard him saying he intended to make Brenda pay for what she did to him right before he went over there last night.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""That's... concerning. We should tell the cops.""
[Message 18] Jordan: ""Already did. Just passing along info. Speaking of cops, you remember Sam, the trans woman? She was one of the victims, right?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Yeah, so messed up. Seemed like a really kind person. What was she even doing at the Coffee Shop? Was she on a break or something?""
[Message 20] Jordan: ""I don't know. I was under the impression that the punishment for these crimes is severe.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Probably. They're going away for a long time for this, whoever did it.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""Hey, you wouldn't happen to know why someone would use a Impalement with a sharp object, would you?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""No! Why would you even ask me that? That is a weird question to ask right now. Anyway, you know how you thought Kai needed money? I heard they might be getting a huge inheritance soon.""
[Message 24] Jordan: ""Oh, so the money thing was a red herring. Good to know. What will the police do?""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Probably investigate everyone. Hope they find the real killer fast. I am terrified.""
[Message 26] Jordan: ""Me too. So, lawnmower tomorrow, or no?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Haha, classic you. Still thinking about that? Maybe just leave it at his door?""

[Message 19] Maya: Ava? Seriously?

[Message 20] Liam: Ava, the one with full lips? What would she need an ice pick for?

[Message 21] Sarah: I don't know! Maybe for ice sculptures? It was at the hardware store.

[Message 22] Maya: Ice sculptures in East St. Louis? Seems unlikely.

[Message 23] Liam: True lol.

[Message 24] Sarah: Okay, I'm just saying what I saw!

[Message 25] Maya: No worries, just seems sus.

[Message 26] Liam: Did you guys know Chris at all? I only saw him around.

[Message 27] Maya: Not really. Just knew he was… around.

[Message 28] Sarah: I knew Chris a little bit. Seemed like he was always trying to make a deal. Ambitious guy.

[Message 29] Liam: Yeah, that's the vibe I got.

[Message 30] Maya: I heard Ava and Chris didn't get along. Something about a secret?

[Message 31] Sarah: Oh really? I didn’t know that.

[Message 32] Liam: Ooh, juicy. What secret?

[Message 33] Maya: No idea. Just a rumor.

[Message 34] Sarah: Well, if it involved Chris, it was probably something shady.

[Message 35] Liam: Agreed.

[Message 36] Maya: This whole thing is just so messed up.

[Message 37] Sarah: I keep thinking about Jamie. He was so young.

[Message 38] Liam: Yeah, that's what gets me too.

[Message 39] Maya: Okay, I'm going to try to get some sleep. This is giving me nightmares.

[Message 40] Liam: Same. Night.

[Message 41] Sarah: Good night.

[Message 42] Liam: Hey Maya, you up?

[Message 43] Maya: Yeah, what's up?

[Message 44] Liam: I was just thinking about what you said about Ava and Chris. Do you think she intended to hurt him?

[Message 45] Maya: I don't know, Liam. It's just a rumor. Don't start jumping to conclusions.

[Message 46] Liam: True. It's just... the ice pick thing...

[Message 47] Sarah: Guys, come on. Let’s not start pointing fingers.

[Message 48] Maya: Exactly, Sarah.

[Message 49] Liam: Right, right. Sorry. Just hard not to think about it.

[Message 50] Sarah: I understand.

[Message 51] Maya: Did either of you guys see Ava Evening?

[Message 52] Liam: No, I was at home all night.

[Message 53] Sarah: Same here.

[Message 54] Maya: Okay, just checking.

[Message 55] Liam: Why?

[Message 56] Maya: No reason. Just trying to piece things together.

[Message 57] Sarah: Well, let the police do their job, Maya.

[Message 58] Maya: You're right.

[Message 59] Liam: This is crazy. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 60] Sarah: Me too. Justice for Chris and Jamie.

[Message 61] Maya: Agreed.

[Message 62] Liam: Hey, unrelated, but anyone know a good place to get a tire changed?

[Message 63] Maya: I do! I'll text you the info.

[Message 64] Sarah: You guys are changing the subject fast.

[Message 65] Liam: Just trying to think about something else for a minute, Sarah.

[Message 66] Sarah: I get it.

[Message 67] Maya: Yeah, sorry. It's just... a lot.

[Message 68] Liam: Agreed.

[Message 69] Maya: Okay, going to try to sleep again. Hopefully, this time it works.

[Message 70] Sarah: Good luck.

[Message 71] Liam: Night.

[Message 72] Sarah: Hey Maya, you there?

[Message 73] Maya: Yeah, what's up now?

[Message 74] Sarah: Just had a weird thought. Remember how I said I saw Ava at the hardware store?

[Message 75] Maya: Yeah?

[Message 76] Sarah: I think... I think I saw her talking to Chris earlier that day. They looked like they were arguing.

[Message 77] Maya: Seriously? Why didn't you say anything earlier?

[Message 78] Sarah: I didn't think anything of it at the time! It was just a quick glimpse. But now…

[Message 79] Maya: Did it look heated? Like she wanted to get rid of him?

[Message 80] Sarah: I don't know. It was just… intense. He was looking down when she turned away.

[Message 81] Liam: Okay, this is getting serious.

[Message 82] Maya: Maybe you should tell the police, Sarah.

[Message 83] Sarah: I know, I know. I'm just… scared.

[Message 84] Liam: Scared of what?

[Message 85] Sarah: I don't know... getting involved. This is East St. Louis, things happen. I hope she didn't mean for any of this. I'm going to call them now.

...","[Message 1] Amelia: Hey, have you heard about what happened at the Thrift Store?

[Message 2] Ben: Yeah, crazy. Someone found 7.  Activist. Awful.

[Message 3] Amelia: I know, right? I saw River there just yesterday.

[Message 4] Ben: River? Isn't that Chloe’s friend?

[Message 5] Amelia: Yeah, I think so. Did you know 7.  Activist well?

[Message 6] Ben: Nah, just saw them around. This is Winston-Salem, everyone knows everyone a little. Heard they were pretty active in that environmental group.

[Message 7] Amelia: True. I wonder who would do something like that. The news said it was Asphyxiation by strangulation.

[Message 8] Ben: I saw Maya arguing with 7.  Activist a few weeks ago. Something about a protest permit.

[Message 9] Amelia: Maya? Really? That's intense.

[Message 10] Ben: I know, Maya can be a bit…passionate. But murder? Seems a bit extreme, right?

[Message 11] Amelia: Totally. It was at Predawn too. Creepy. What time were you even awake?

[Message 12] Ben: Couldn’t sleep. Scrolling through stuff, you know? Terrible insomnia.

[Message 13] Amelia: I get that. Remember when Kai got fired from the thrift store?

[Message 14] Ben: Yeah, after that whole… incident. 7.  Activist was involved, right?

[Message 15] Amelia: I think so. I thought Kai was over it, though. This happened a while ago.

[Message 16] Ben: People hold grudges, Amelia. Especially Kai. Did you hear the rumor about the Asphyxiation by strangulation?

[Message 17] Amelia: No…

[Message 18] Ben: Apparently, Kai was looking up how to make one online a while back.

[Message 19] Amelia: Whoa. That's...disturbing.

[Message 20] Ben: My point exactly.

[Message 21] Amelia: I need coffee. This is too much for a Monday.

[Message 22] Ben: Tell me about it. You think the cops will figure it out quickly?

[Message 23] Amelia: You know Detective Miller, he's sharp. What about Chloe?

[Message 24] Ben: What about her?

[Message 25] Amelia: Isn't she like, super close to River? Maybe she knows something.

[Message 26] Ben: I doubt it. Chloe is pretty quiet, right?

[Message 27] Amelia: That's what everyone thinks. Still.

[Message 28] Ben: Good point. Remember that time Chloe painted that mural downtown?

[Message 29] Amelia: Yeah, what about it?

[Message 30] Ben: Nothing, just random. Trying to distract myself. Did you see the victim's age? Only 18.

[Message 31] Amelia: I know. Awful. It feels like the whole city is holding its breath.

[Message 32] Ben: You going to River's vigil tomorrow?

[Message 33] Amelia: Probably. You?

[Message 34] Ben: Yeah, gotta pay respects.

[Message 35] Amelia: I just hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 36] Ben: Agreed. Maybe they'll get the death penalty.

[Message 37] Amelia: Maybe. But it's North Carolina.

[Message 38] Ben: So true. You ever think about moving somewhere else?

[Message 39] Amelia: Sometimes. Depends on the day. You?

[Message 40] Ben: Always. Winston-Salem’s getting a little…intense.

[Message 41] Amelia: Tell me about it. I'm going to grab that coffee. Talk later?

[Message 42] Ben: Later. Stay safe.

[Message 43] Amelia: You too.

[Message 44] Ben: Hey, one more thing. Do you know what River's activism was about?

[Message 45] Amelia: Something about environmental stuff and… stopping a new development downtown, I think.

[Message 46] Ben: Maybe that's connected?

[Message 47] Amelia: Who knows? Developers are ruthless.

[Message 48] Ben: True that.

[Message 49] Amelia: Ok, *now* I'm getting coffee.

[Message 50] Ben: Enjoy!

[Message 51] Amelia: Thanks!

[Message 52] Ben: Amelia? One more thing. This is gonna sound weird.

[Message 53] Amelia: What is it?

[Message 54] Ben: Did you see Maya anywhere near the Thrift Store that night? Actus Reus

[Message 55] Amelia: I wasn't out at all. I had that stomach bug. I thought you knew that. Mens Rea

[Message 56] Ben: Oh, right! Sorry, my head's all over the place.

[Message 57] Amelia: No worries. You okay? You seem… anxious.

[Message 58] Ben: Just stressed, that's all. Promise.

[Message 59] Amelia: Okay. But seriously, if you need to talk…

[Message 60] Ben: I appreciate that. I do.

[Message 61] Amelia: Good. Look, I really need to get this coffee.

[Message 62] Ben: Go for it. Talk soon.

[Message 63] Amelia: Later.

[Message 64] Ben: I heard that Chloe failed to call 911 until like 2 hours later. Causation

[Message 65] Amelia: Why?

[Message 66] Ben: No idea. Sounds kind of suspicious. Attempt

[Message 67] Amelia: That is strange

[Message 68] Ben: Yeah, very strange

[Message 69] Amelia: Ben?

[Message 70] Ben: Yeah?

[Message 71] Amelia: Why were you out at Predawn? You never answered my question Concurrence

[Message 72] Ben: I told you, i couldn't sleep and i was scrolling through stuff

[Message 73] Amelia: So you were near the thrift store at the time of the murder

[Message 74] Ben: I said I was in the area, I did not say I was at the thrift store Attendant/Extenuating Circumstances

[Message 75] Amelia: Okay. Mens Rea

[Message 5] Maya: Just the same. So messed up.

[Message 17] Sarah: Seriously? Donnie? That’s insane. He wouldn’t hurt a fly.
[Message 18] Ben: That’s what I thought too. Unless… did he ever mention anything about Danny? Like, bad blood or something?
[Message 19] Sarah: No! Never! He actually always said Danny made a good drink. He did seem stressed lately, though. Business stuff, I think.
[Message 20] Chloe: Stress? He purposefully signed that deal to ruin Danny.
[Message 21] Sarah: What deal? I don't know anything about that.
[Message 22] Maya: I think Chloe's referring to the bar supply contract. Donnie outbid Danny's usual supplier.
[Message 23] Sarah: Oh, right. Still, doesn't mean he'd kill someone!

[Message 37] Ben: Remember when Lily got fired? Donnie was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 38] Sarah: Yeah... that was rough. She shouldn't have been shouting like that, probably provoked him.

[Message 16] CHLOE: ""Cool. So, this murder… any suspects?""
[Message 17] LIAM: ""I heard the cops are talking to everyone who was there that day.""
[Message 18] FINN: ""That's standard procedure. They have to. ""
[Message 19] CHLOE: ""True. I just hope they catch whoever did it. Dale didn't deserve that, nor did Judge Thompson.""
[Message 20] LIAM: ""Heard Dale was pretty stubborn. Didnt budge on issues even when he knew he was wrong.""
[Message 21] FINN: ""Stubborn how?""
[Message 22] LIAM: ""Just… you know. By the book. But that doesn't mean he deserved to die.""
[Message 23] CHLOE: ""Of course not. Nobody does. I'm just scared, that's all.""
[Message 24] FINN: ""Scared of what?""
[Message 25] CHLOE: ""That it could happen again. That someone we know could be… capable of something like that.""
[Message 26] LIAM: ""Don't think like that, Chloe. It'll drive you crazy. I was at the gym all day. ""
[Message 27] FINN: ""Yeah, Liam's right. Worrying won't help. I had to pick up some stuff for Mom. Headache stuff. ""
[Message 28] CHLOE: ""Okay, okay. Distract me. What's everyone doing this weekend?""
[Message 29] LIAM: ""Thinking of going camping. Need to clear my head.""
[Message 30] FINN: ""Camping? Sounds boring. I'm hitting up that new club downtown.""
[Message 31] CHLOE: ""A club? With all this going on? Brave.""
[Message 32] FINN: ""Life goes on, Chloe. Besides, gotta try and meet someone.""
[Message 33] LIAM: ""Good luck with that. I'll bring back some smores.""
[Message 34] CHLOE: ""Save me some. Finn, be careful at the club, okay?""
[Message 35] FINN: ""Always am. Later.""
[Message 36] LIAM: ""Later, Finn.""
[Message 37] CHLOE: ""Bye, Finn.""
[Message 38] CHLOE: ""So, camping… you going alone, Liam?""
[Message 39] LIAM: ""Yeah, probably. Just need some peace and quiet.""
[Message 40] CHLOE: ""I get that. I might just stay in and watch movies all weekend.""
[Message 41] LIAM: ""Sounds relaxing. Maybe I'll join you Sunday if the woods are too much.""
[Message 42] CHLOE: ""Sounds good. We can order takeout. I want to learn how to play guitar""
[Message 43] LIAM: ""You and me both. Hey, did you ever talk to Dale much?""
[Message 44] CHLOE: ""Dale? Not really. He came in for dry cleaning sometimes, but we didn't chat. Why?""
[Message 45] LIAM: ""Just curious. He always seemed… on edge.""
[Message 46] CHLOE: ""Maybe he had a stressful job.""
[Message 47] LIAM: ""Yeah, maybe. Anyway, gotta pack. Talk later, Chloe.""
[Message 48] CHLOE: ""Okay, have fun! Be safe! Let me know if you need anything.""
[Message 49] LIAM: ""Will do.""
[Message 50] FINN: ""Hey, Chloe. You still up?""
[Message 51] CHLOE: ""Yeah, just watching TV. What's up?""
[Message 52] FINN: ""Something weird happened at the store today.""
[Message 53] CHLOE: ""What kind of weird?""
[Message 54] FINN: ""This guy was asking for some really specific Poisoning via ingestion. Like, knew exactly what he wanted.""
[Message 55] CHLOE: ""Okay… and?""
[Message 56] FINN: ""It was strange. Made me uncomfortable. He even had visible veins in hands""
[Message 57] CHLOE: ""Did you get a good look at him?""
[Message 58] FINN: ""Yeah, kinda. Mid-twenties, I think. Hunchback posture. Wore a hat.""
[Message 59] CHLOE: ""Hunchback posture? That's… distinctive.""
[Message 60] FINN: ""Tell me about it. I just thought it was weird timing, you know? With the murders and all.""
[Message 61] CHLOE: ""Definitely weird. Did you tell the police?""
[Message 62] FINN: ""I was going to, but then I thought maybe I was overreacting.""
[Message 63] CHLOE: ""Finn, you should tell them. It could be important. I think this guy intended to hurt Dale""
[Message 64] FINN: ""Okay, okay. I will. First thing in the morning. Thanks, Chloe.""
[Message 65] CHLOE: ""No problem. Just be safe. And maybe don't go to that club tonight?""
[Message 66] FINN: ""Nah, I'm good. Staying in. This whole thing has me freaked out now too. Later""
[Message 67] CHLOE: ""Good idea. Goodnight, Finn.""
[Message 68] FINN: ""Night.""
[Message 69] LIAM: ""Chloe, you still up?""
[Message 70] CHLOE: ""Yeah, just talked to Finn. What's up?""
[Message 71] LIAM: ""I can't sleep. Keep thinking about Judge Thompson. The kindest man I've ever met.""
[Message 72] CHLOE: ""I know, it's awful. What are you thinking about specifically?""
[Message 73] LIAM: ""I don't know… just… how could someone do that? He helped so many people.""
[Message 74] CHLOE: ""People are messed up, Liam. That's all there is to it.""
[Message 75] LIAM: ""Yeah, I guess. I keep thinking about the last time I saw him. He was talking about retiring soon.""
[Message 76] CHLOE: ""Retiring? Really?""
[Message 77] LIAM: ""Yeah. Said he wanted to travel the world. Guess that's not happening now. I intended to visit him again.""
[Message 78] CHLOE: ""That's so sad. Maybe you can still travel the world, Liam. In his memory.""
[Message 79] LIAM: ""Maybe. Right now, I just feel sick. Chloe, do you think this will be solved?""
[Message 80] CHLOE: ""I hope so, Liam. I really do. We have to trust the police.""
[Message 81] LIAM: ""Easy for you to say. You’re not the one who knew him.""
[Message 82] CHLOE: ""I know, I know. I'm sorry, Liam. I didn't mean to sound insensitive.""
[Message 83] LIAM: ""It's okay. I'm just… raw. I need to stop texting. Going to try and sleep.""
[Message 84] CHLOE: ""Okay. Get some rest. I'm here if you need to talk.""
[Message 85] LIAM: ""Thanks, Chloe.""
[Message 86] FINN: ""Hey Chloe, you won't believe this.""
[Message 87] CHLOE: ""What now, Finn?""
[Message 88] FINN: ""I went to the police station this morning. Told them about the guy from the store.""
[Message 89] CHLOE: ""And?""
[Message 90] FINN: ""They said they already had someone in custody. Someone matching that description.""
[Message 91] CHLOE: ""Seriously? That was fast.""
[Message 92] FINN: ""Yeah, but get this… they said he was buying the Poisoning via ingestion for… his mom. For her garden.""
[Message 93] CHLOE: ""His mom? For her garden? Seriously? It might be an attempt to mislead authorities""
[Message 94] FINN: ""That's what they said. So, false alarm, I guess.""
[Message 95] CHLOE: ""I don't know, Finn. It still seems fishy. I would've said its causation for the murder""
[Message 96] FINN: ""Maybe. But the cops seemed pretty sure. Said he had an alibi for the time of the murders.""
[Message 97] CHLOE: ""An alibi? Damn. Okay, well, that's good, I guess. One less thing to worry about.""
[Message 98] FINN: ""Exactly. Anyway, I'm gonna go grab some lunch. You want anything?""
[Message 99] CHLOE: ""No, I'm good. Thanks. Let me know if you hear anything else.""
[Message 100] FINN: ""Will do.""
[Message 101] LIAM: ""Chloe, you free?""
[Message 102] CHLOE: ""Yeah, what's up?""
[Message 103] LIAM: ""I'm back from camping. Didn't last the night.""
[Message 104] CHLOE: ""What happened? Too many bugs?""
[Message 105] LIAM: ""Worse. I couldn't stop thinking about Judge Thompson. And then I saw something…""
[Message 106] CHLOE: ""Saw what?""
[Message 107] LIAM: ""Someone messing around near his cabin. It's out in the woods too, you know? I didn't get a good look, but…""
[Message 108] CHLOE: ""Liam, are you saying you think someone was… planning something?""
[Message 109] LIAM: ""I don't know what I'm saying, Chloe! I'm just… this whole thing is messed up.""
[Message 110] CHLOE: ""Okay, breathe. Did you call the police?""
[Message 111] LIAM: ""No! I panicked and left. I didn't want to get involved.""
[Message 112] CHLOE: ""Liam, you need to tell them this! It could be important!""
[Message 113] LIAM: ""I know, I know. But what if I'm wrong? What if it was nothing?""
[Message 114] CHLOE: ""It's better to be safe than sorry. Please, Liam.""
[Message 115] LIAM: ""Okay, fine. I'll call them. But I'm scared, Chloe.""
[Message 116] CHLOE: ""I know you are. But you're doing the right thing. I'm proud of you. Let me know what they say.""
[Message 117] LIAM: ""Okay. Thanks, Chloe.""
[Message 118] FINN: ""Hey, Chloe, you hear about Liam?""
[Message 119] CHLOE: ""Yeah, he just told me. What did you hear?""
[Message 120] FINN: ""That he's telling the cops some crazy story about seeing someone near Judge Thompson's cabin.""
[Message 121] CHLOE: ""It's not crazy, Finn! He was genuinely scared!""
[Message 122] FINN: ""Maybe. Or maybe he's trying to throw suspicion off himself. He always hated Judge Thompson""
[Message 123] CHLOE: ""What? Why would he hate Judge Thompson?""
[Message 124] FINN: ""I don't know. Just a vibe I got. Plus, he was always sucking up to him. Seems sus""
[Message 125] CHLOE: ""Finn, that's ridiculous. Liam is just… upset. And scared.""
[Message 126] FINN: ""Whatever you say. I still think it's weird. Anyway, I'm going out for a bit. Need to clear my head.""
[Message 127] CHLOE: ""Be careful, Finn. And maybe don't spread rumors about Liam, okay?""
[Message 128] FINN: ""Fine, fine. See ya.""
[Message 129] LIAM: ""Chloe, the police just left.""
[Message 130] CHLOE: ""What did they say? Did they believe you?""
[Message 131] LIAM: ""They said they'd look into it. But they seemed… skeptical.""
[Message 132] CHLOE: ""That's all they said? Did they ask you anything else?""
[Message 133] LIAM: ""Yeah, they asked me about my relationship with Judge Thompson. And about my alibi for the day of the murders.""
[Message 134] CHLOE: ""Alibi? Liam, are you a suspect?""
[Message 135] LIAM: ""I don't know, Chloe! I hope not! I was at the gym all day! I failed to call 911 after seeing the man, making it worse.""
[Message 136] CHLOE: ""Okay, okay, calm down. Just tell them the truth. They'll figure it out.""
[Message 137] LIAM: ""I hope so. I really do. I can't believe this is happening. I wonder if they are going away for a long time because of this.""
[Message 138] CHLOE: ""Just stay calm, Liam. I'm here for you. You know that, right?""
[Message 139] LIAM: ""Yeah. Thanks, Chloe. I appreciate it.""
[Message 140] CHLOE: ""Of course. Hey, did you hear from Finn?""
[Message 141] LIAM: ""No. Why?""
[Message 142] CHLOE: ""Just wondering. He seemed a little… off. After you told me about the cabin.""
[Message 143] LIAM: ""Off how?""
[Message 144] CHLOE: ""I don't know… like he was trying to convince me you were guilty.""
[Message 145] LIAM: ""Finn? Really? That's… weird.""
[Message 146] CHLOE: ""Yeah. Just be careful, Liam. I don't trust him right now.""
[Message 147] LIAM: ""I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Chloe. You're a good friend.""
[Message 148] CHLOE: ""Anytime, Liam.""
[Message 149] FINN: ""Hey Chloe, long time no talk""
[Message 150] CHLOE: ""Finn, what do you want?""
[Message 151] FINN: ""Just checking in. Heard Liam is getting heat from the cops.""
[Message 152] CHLOE: ""Yeah, because he did the right thing! Unlike some people...""
[Message 153] FINN: ""Woah, hostile. Just saying, karma's a b**ch.""
[Message 154] CHLOE: ""Get out of my messages Finn""
[Message 155] FINN: ""Whatever, Chloe.""

6. Ensure all victims are mentioned by name or role (e.g., ""the manager"") at least once in the conversation.
7. **Incorporate at least 6 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Early Hours"", ""She was buying Suffocation with a pillow at the store"").

        *   **Attendant/Extenuating Circumstances:** References to factors that could influence culpability (e.g., victim's age in a statutory rape hypothetical, potential self-defense claims, evidence of duress, victim's own aggression leading to the crime.)
8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

...","[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey, did you hear about what happened at Grocery Store?
[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, insane! Some 7.  Activist, right? Name was Alex, I think?
[Message 3] CHLOE: Yeah, Alex. I can't believe it.
[Message 4] LIAM: So messed up. You okay? You live near there, right?
[Message 5] CHLOE: Yeah, a few blocks. It's creepy. Heard anything about who did it?
[Message 6] LIAM: Just rumors. Something about a disgruntled employee?
[Message 7] CHLOE: Ugh, that's awful.
[Message 8] LIAM: Hey, you still got that book I lent you?
[Message 9] CHLOE: Oh shoot, almost forgot! I'll bring it tomorrow.
[Message 10] LIAM: No worries!

[Message 11] MARTHA: This is terrible about Alex. I saw them just last week.
[Message 12] BEN: I know, Martha. I'm in shock.
[Message 13] MARTHA: You think it was political?
[Message 14] BEN: Honestly, I have no idea. Anything's possible these days.
[Message 15] MARTHA: I heard Rashad got fired from Grocery Store last month.
[Message 16] BEN: Rashad? Really?
[Message 17] MARTHA: Yeah, I overheard him complaining about Alex once. Said something about 'stirring up trouble'.
[Message 18] BEN: Hmm, interesting. I wonder if the police know that.
[Message 19] MARTHA: I don't know.
[Message 20] BEN: Thanks for the info, Martha.

[Message 21] CHLOE: Did you ever meet Alex?
[Message 22] LIAM: Nah, never personally. Just saw them around. Why?
[Message 23] CHLOE: Just curious. This whole thing is just...unsettling.
[Message 24] LIAM: Tell me about it. Makes you think.
[Message 25] CHLOE: Yeah, makes you wonder what people are capable of.
[Message 26] LIAM: Speaking of, you still planning on going to that concert next week?
[Message 27] CHLOE: Yep! Need a distraction.
[Message 28] LIAM: Cool.

[Message 29] BEN: So, Martha told me you knew Rashad?
[Message 30] JESSICA: Yeah, vaguely. Worked together on a project once. Why?
[Message 31] BEN: Just heard he got fired from Grocery Store. Thought maybe he had a motive.
[Message 32] JESSICA: Rashad? Seriously? He always seemed kind of...intense.
[Message 33] BEN: Intense how?
[Message 34] JESSICA: Just, passionate about his beliefs. Especially about social justice issues. Alex was involved in that stuff, too, right?
[Message 35] BEN: Yeah, I think so.

[Message 36] MARTHA: Do you think he would hurt someone? Rashad?
[Message 37] BEN: I don't know, Martha. People are unpredictable. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 38] MARTHA: Maybe he didn't intend for it to go that far.
[Message 39] BEN: Maybe. But Alex is gone.

[Message 40] JESSICA: Did you hear about Dakota being at Grocery Store around Early Hours?
[Message 41] BEN: Dakota? What were they doing there?
[Message 42] JESSICA: No idea. Just heard it from someone.
[Message 43] BEN: That's strange.

[Message 44] CHLOE: This weather is insane!
[Message 45] LIAM: Seriously! Need a boat, not a car.

[Message 46] MARTHA: The news said the Suffocation with a pillow at the crime scene.
[Message 47] BEN: Yeah, awful.

[Message 48] JESSICA: You think they'll catch who did it soon?
[Message 49] BEN: I hope so. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 50] LIAM: You watching the game tonight?
[Message 51] CHLOE: Wouldn't miss it!

[Message 52] BEN: Have you spoken to Rashad lately?
[Message 53] JESSICA: No, not since the project. Why? Should I be worried?
[Message 54] BEN: Just trying to piece things together.

[Message 55] MARTHA: I keep thinking about Alex's family.
[Message 56] BEN: It's heartbreaking.

[Message 57] CHLOE: Pizza or tacos tonight?
[Message 58] LIAM: Tacos, definitely!

[Message 59] JESSICA: This whole thing is giving me anxiety.
[Message 60] BEN: Me too. Try to relax.

[Message 61] MARTHA: I need to stop reading the news.
[Message 62] BEN: Good idea.

[Message 63] LIAM: You think they will get the death penalty?
[Message 64] CHLOE: They deserve the worst.

[Message 65] BEN: I heard Dakota was buying Suffocation with a pillow last week.
[Message 66] JESSICA: Really? I find that suspicious. 
[Message 67] BEN: She said she wanted to get rid of him.
[Message 68] JESSICA: Get rid of who?
[Message 69] BEN: Dakota was talking about Alex.
[Message 70] JESSICA: I am truly shocked.

[Message 71] CHLOE: I need coffee ASAP.
[Message 72] LIAM: Story of my life.

[Message 73] BEN: Something isn't adding up with Rashad.
[Message 74] JESSICA: What do you mean?
[Message 75] BEN: He seems too calm about it all.

[Message 76] MARTHA: I can't believe someone would do that to Alex.
[Message 77] BEN: Me neither, Martha. It's beyond comprehension.

[Message 78] LIAM: What time should I pick you up for the concert?
[Message 79] CHLOE: 7 PM work?

[Message 80] JESSICA: Maybe Rashad is just in shock.
[Message 81] BEN: Maybe. Or maybe he intended for this all along.

[Message 82] MARTHA: I keep replaying everything in my head.
[Message 83] BEN: I know. It's hard to stop.

[Message 84] CHLOE: Did you see that new movie trailer?
[Message 85] LIAM: Yeah! Looks amazing!

[Message 86] JESSICA: Do you think Dakota knew what she was doing?
[Message 87] BEN: It was premeditated to some extent.

[Message 88] MARTHA: This city feels different now.
[Message 89] BEN: It does.

[Message 90] LIAM: What's your favorite pizza topping?
[Message 91] CHLOE: Pepperoni, always!

[Message 92] JESSICA: Ben, I'm starting to get scared.
[Message 93] BEN: Don't be. We'll get through this.

[Message 94] MARTHA: I just want justice for Alex.
[Message 95] BEN: Me too, Martha. Me too.

[Message 96] CHLOE: Any good sales going on?
[Message 97] LIAM: I think I saw something at Target.

[Message 98] JESSICA: I'm thinking of volunteering at the animal shelter.
[Message 99] BEN: That's a great idea.

[Message 100] MARTHA: I need to get out of the house.
[Message 101] BEN: Go for a walk. Clear your head.

[Message 102] LIAM: You see anything about the Grocery Store case?
[Message 103] CHLOE: No, nothing new. Still under investigation, I guess.

[Message 104] BEN: Jessica, don't mention my name if the cops ask you about Dakota.
[Message 105] JESSICA: Why Ben? Are you hiding something?
[Message 106] BEN: It is for the best.
[Message 107] JESSICA: I dont like this Ben, I dont know what you know.

[Message 108] MARTHA: I heard that the manager saw someone leaving the store at Early Hours.
[Message 109] BEN: Someone specific? Did they give a description?
[Message 110] MARTHA: No, just that they saw someone leaving in a hurry.

[Message 111] CHLOE: I think I need a vacation.
[Message 112] LIAM: Me too. Somewhere far away.

[Message 113] JESSICA: You're scaring me, Ben. I'm calling the police if you don't tell me what's going on.
[Message 114] BEN: Don't do that! Just trust me. It's complicated.

[Message 115] MARTHA: The police are looking for witnesses.
[Message 116] BEN: I hope they find someone who saw something.

[Message 117] CHLOE: What do you think about getting a dog?
[Message 118] LIAM: I've always wanted one!

[Message 119] JESSICA: Complicated how, Ben? Someone needs to call 911 after the victim was hurt. This makes you an accessory.
[Message 120] BEN: It doesn't involve me directly, okay? Just...be careful what you say.

[Message 121] MARTHA: I keep having nightmares.
[Message 122] BEN: Try some herbal tea before bed. It might help.

[Message 123] CHLOE: Do you have any good recipes?
[Message 124] LIAM: I make a killer pasta sauce.

[Message 125] JESSICA: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened
[Message 126] BEN: That's just speculation, Jessica.

[Message 127] MARTHA: I wonder if Alex suffered.
[Message 128] BEN: I hope not, Martha. I really hope not.

[Message 129] CHLOE: What are you doing this weekend?
[Message 130] LIAM: Probably just chilling at home.

[Message 131] JESSICA: I'm going to the police, Ben. I can't live with this.
[Message 132] BEN: Don't! You'll regret it. I'm serious, Jessica.

[Message 133] MARTHA: This whole thing is so senseless.
[Message 134] BEN: It is. Absolutely senseless.

[Message 135] CHLOE: Any plans for Halloween?
[Message 136] LIAM: Still figuring it out.

[Message 137] JESSICA: What are you threatening me, Ben?
[Message 138] BEN: Just looking out for you.

[Message 139] MARTHA: I can't sleep.
[Message 140] BEN: Maybe try listening to some calming music.

[Message 141] CHLOE: I need to go shopping soon.
[Message 142] LIAM: Always a good idea!

[Message 143] JESSICA: The more you say, the more suspicious I get.
[Message 144] BEN: It's not what you think.

[Message 145] MARTHA: This is all so unreal.
[Message 146] BEN: I know.

[Message 1] Anya: ""Hey, did you hear about what happened at the gallery?""
[Message 2] Kai: ""Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. Who were they?""
[Message 3] Lena: ""I heard it was awful. Something about Impalement with a sharp object. I can't believe it.""
[Message 4] Anya: ""One was Sarah, the Taxi Driver. The other, I think they said it was David, that Law Enforcement Officer.""
[Message 5] Kai: ""David? No way! I knew him. He was a good guy.""
[Message 6] Lena: ""I feel so bad for Sarah. She was always so quiet.""
[Message 7] Anya: ""Quiet, yeah, but she was tough. Remember when she told off that drunk guy at The Nick?""
[Message 8] Kai: ""Vaguely. Listen, I gotta run. Meeting's starting. Talk later.""
[Message 9] Lena: ""Okay, bye. This is just so upsetting.""
[Message 10] Anya: ""Tell me about it. I can't focus on anything else.""
[Message 11] Lena: ""Did you know them well?""
[Message 12] Anya: ""Sarah, not really. David, a little. We grabbed coffee sometimes. You?""
[Message 13] Lena: ""Nope. Just saw them around. This city is too small.""
[Message 14] Anya: ""Seriously. Wonder what happened.""
[Message 15] Lena: ""The news said something about early morning? Seems risky.""
[Message 16] Anya: ""Yeah, super bold. Or desperate.""
[Message 17] Kai: ""Back. That meeting was pointless. Anything new?""
[Message 18] Anya: ""Just speculating. Lena didn't know them either.""
[Message 19] Kai: ""Crazy. Birmingham's getting wilder.""
[Message 20] Lena: ""I heard something about the crime scene. It's all over social media, but I can't bring myself to look.""
[Message 21] Anya: ""Good call. Best to stay away from that.""
[Message 22] Kai: ""Agreed. So, what are you guys up to tonight?""
[Message 23] Anya: ""Nothing planned. Thinking of watching a movie.""
[Message 24] Lena: ""Same here. Maybe read a book. Something light.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""Cool. I might hit up Marty's PM. Need to unwind.""
[Message 26] Anya: ""Okay, have fun. Be safe.""
[Message 27] Lena: ""Yeah, be careful, Kai.""
[Message 28] Kai: ""Always am. Later.""
[Message 29] Anya: ""So, movie suggestions, Lena?""
[Message 30] Lena: ""Hmm, something funny? I need a distraction.""
[Message 31] Anya: ""How about 'Booksmart'?""
[Message 32] Lena: ""Perfect! I've heard good things. I really need a pick-me-up after this, I swear.""
[Message 33] Anya: ""I know, me too. It's just...creepy.""
[Message 34] Lena: ""Exactly. Creepy is the word.""
[Message 35] Kai: ""Marty's is packed. Headed to that new bar, The Electric. Anyone ever been?""
[Message 36] Anya: ""Nope. Let me know how it is.""
[Message 37] Lena: ""Sounds interesting. Have fun!""
[Message 38] Kai: ""Will do. Later.""
[Message 39] Anya: ""Did you hear that David was supposed to testify in a case soon? A big one?""
[Message 40] Lena: ""No way! Against who?""
[Message 41] Anya: ""I don't know details. But maybe that's connected?""
[Message 42] Lena: ""That could be it. God, this is like a movie.""
[Message 43] Anya: ""Too real for me. Hey, you doing okay?""
[Message 44] Lena: ""Yeah, just shaken. I feel like I'm being watched, you know?""
[Message 45] Anya: ""I get it. Paranoia is contagious. Maybe take a break from the news?""
[Message 46] Lena: ""Good idea. Booksmart it is then!""
[Message 47] Anya: ""Exactly! Let's forget about all this for a while.""
[Message 48] Kai: ""The Electric is dead. Heading home. Night.""
[Message 49] Anya: ""Night, Kai.""
[Message 50] Lena: ""Sleep well.""
[Message 51] Anya: ""Hey Lena, something's been bugging me. Did you see anything weird the past few days?""
[Message 52] Lena: ""Weird how? Like...ghosts?""
[Message 53] Anya: ""No, like… unusual behavior from anyone we know.""
[Message 54] Lena: ""Now that you mention it, I did see Kai arguing with someone outside the gallery last week. Seemed intense.""
[Message 55] Anya: ""Really? Who?""
[Message 56] Lena: ""I couldn't tell. It was dark. But Kai seemed really angry. He always hated 3.  Taxi Driver""
[Message 57] Anya: ""Huh. That's...interesting.""
[Message 58] Lena: ""Maybe it's nothing. But it stuck with me.""
[Message 59] Anya: ""No, tell me more. What else?""
[Message 60] Lena: ""Nothing concrete. Just a feeling.""
[Message 61] Anya: ""Feelings matter. Don't dismiss them.""
[Message 62] Kai: ""Morning, ladies. Rough night. Headache from hell.""
[Message 63] Anya: ""Morning, Kai. You okay?""
[Message 64] Lena: ""Yeah, you sound awful.""
[Message 65] Kai: ""Just a hangover. The Electric's tequila is lethal. Anyway, what's up?""
[Message 66] Anya: ""Just chatting.""
[Message 67] Lena: ""Anya was asking if I'd seen anything strange lately.""
[Message 68] Kai: ""Strange how?""
[Message 69] Lena: ""Just...anything out of the ordinary.""
[Message 70] Kai: ""Nah, same old same old. Why?""
[Message 71] Anya: ""No reason. Just curious.""
[Message 72] Lena: ""So, that case David was involved in...scary.""
[Message 73] Kai: ""Yeah, that's messed up. Hope they find whoever did this soon. They're going away for a long time for this""
[Message 74] Anya: ""Me too. For everyone's sake.""
[Message 75] Lena: ""I still can't shake this feeling that something isn't right.""
[Message 76] Anya: ""I know. Me neither. Trust your gut.""
[Message 77] Kai: ""Gut feelings are usually indigestion. Just saying.""
[Message 78] Lena: ""Maybe, but sometimes they're more than that.""
[Message 79] Anya: ""True. So, Kai, you were at Marty's PM, then The Electric? That's it?""
[Message 80] Kai: ""Yeah, why? You think I was out murdering people? He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there""
[Message 81] Anya: ""Just asking. Police are gonna ask the same thing.""
[Message 82] Kai: ""True. Well, that's where I was. End of story.""
[Message 83] Lena: ""Speaking of the police, I saw them at the gallery again this morning. Seemed like they were focusing on the back entrance.""
[Message 84] Anya: ""Interesting. Wonder why.""
[Message 85] Kai: ""Maybe that's how the killer got in.""
[Message 86] Lena: ""Possible. This whole thing is making me so anxious.""
[Message 87] Anya: ""Me too. Let's try to stay positive. They'll figure it out.""
[Message 88] Kai: ""Hope so. This city needs a win.""
[Message 89] Anya: ""Hey, I just remembered something. Last week, I saw Lena buying a bunch of sharp knives at that kitchen store. Didn't think anything of it then...""
[Message 90] Lena: ""What?! Anya, what are you implying?""
[Message 91] Kai: ""Woah, that's...not good timing, Lena.""
[Message 92] Lena: ""I cook! I like to cook! Is that a crime now? I needed new knives!""
[Message 93] Anya: ""Just saying it's a little weird considering...""
[Message 94] Lena: ""This is insane. You're turning on me?""
[Message 95] Kai: ""Look, let's all calm down. This is getting out of hand.""
[Message 96] Anya: ""I'm calm. Just pointing out facts.""
[Message 97] Lena: ""I'm leaving this conversation. I can't believe you guys.""
[Message 98] Lena: ""If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened""
[Message 99] Lena: ""Anya, I swear on my life, I had nothing to do with this. You know I'm not violent.""
[Message 100] Anya: ""Then why so defensive? It just looks bad.""
[Message 101] Kai: ""Guys, seriously. Stop. We're all stressed. Accusations aren't helping.""
[Message 102] Anya: ""Fine. But I'm not forgetting this.""
[Message 103] Kai: ""Let's just...drop it. Anyone want to grab coffee later? Neutral ground?""
[Message 104] Anya: ""Maybe. I need to think.""
[Message 105] Lena: ""I don't think I can face either of you right now.""
[Message 106] Kai: ""Okay. Well, the offer's there.""
[Message 107] Anya: ""Hey, Kai, did you ever find out who that was arguing with outside the gallery?""
[Message 108] Kai: ""Nah, never saw them again. It was probably nothing, some business squabble. I am aware that the police will ask the same.""
[Message 109] Anya: ""Maybe. Or maybe it was related to David's case.""
[Message 110] Kai: ""Could be. This whole thing is a mess.""
[Message 111] Lena: ""You think they'll ever find the killer?""
[Message 112] Anya: ""They have to. For Sarah and David.""
[Message 113] Kai: ""Yeah, they deserve justice.""
[Message 114] Anya: ""I need to clear my head. Going for a walk.""
[Message 115] Kai: ""Alright, be careful. It's getting dark.""

[Message 74] SERENA: ""Sorry I'm so late! This day has been crazy.""
[Message 75] CHLOE: ""No problem, Serena! We were just catching up.""
[Message 76] LIAM: ""Yeah, Chloe was just saying how much she misses Alex’s taxi service.""
[Message 77] CHLOE: ""Exactly! He was the best. Speaking of, Serena, you said something earlier about him that was a little… cryptic.""
[Message 78] SERENA: ""Oh, that? I told you, it was just a dumb joke I overheard.""
[Message 79] LIAM: ""But it sounded like you knew something about a conflict.""
[Message 80] SERENA: ""Guys, seriously, I don't. I just... I heard someone say that Ben and Alex argued sometimes, that's all. I didn't mean anything by it.""

[Message 82] SERENA: ""I don't know! I just overheard it at Nightclub once. Please drop it, I feel like I'm being interrogated.""

...","[Message 1] Chloe: Hey Liam, you okay? You seemed off yesterday.
[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, just tired. Long week. You heading to that new exhibit downtown?
[Message 3] Chloe: Thinking about it. Heard it's pretty cool. You going?
[Message 4] Liam: Maybe later. Got some errands. Did you hear what happened at the Synagogue?
[Message 5] Chloe: Yeah, awful. Poor Sarah.
[Message 6] Chloe: What do you think happened?
[Message 7] Liam: No idea. Crazy world. Hey, can you believe my car needs another repair?
[Message 8] Chloe: Ugh, cars. Tell me about it. Mine's making a weird noise.
[Message 9] Liam: Maybe get it checked out soon. So, that exhibit...worth it?
[Message 10] Chloe: Supposedly. Heard it’s all about local artists.
[Message 11] Liam: Cool. Maybe I’ll catch it next week.
[Message 12] Chloe: Sounds good. Anyway, gotta run. Catch you later.
[Message 13] Liam: Later, Chloe.
[Message 14] Maya: Liam, have you seen Ben lately? He's been avoiding my calls.
[Message 15] Liam: No, haven't seen him since that party last Saturday. Why?
[Message 16] Maya: Just worried. He seemed stressed about his job.
[Message 17] Liam: He always stresses about work. It's Ben.
[Message 18] Maya: True. But he seemed…different. Anxious.
[Message 19] Liam: Maybe he’s just tired. You know how he gets. Did you hear what happened to Sarah?
[Message 20] Maya: Yeah. Tragic. Did they catch anyone?
[Message 21] Liam: Not that I know of. Police are all over the place.
[Message 22] Maya: I can’t imagine what her family is going through.
[Message 23] Liam: Me neither. So, you gonna confront Ben?
[Message 24] Maya: I’ll try again tomorrow. He needs to talk to someone.
[Message 25] Liam: Good luck with that. Let me know if you need anything.
[Message 26] Maya: Thanks, Liam. Appreciate it.
[Message 27] Ben: Maya, I need to talk to you. Meet me at JavaStop in an hour?
[Message 28] Maya: What’s wrong, Ben? You sound serious.
[Message 29] Ben: I can't explain over text. Just meet me.
[Message 30] Maya: Okay, okay. I’ll be there.
[Message 31] Chloe: Ben, are you okay? Maya seemed really worried.
[Message 32] Ben: I’m fine, Chloe. Just dealing with some stuff.
[Message 33] Chloe: Anything I can help with?
[Message 34] Ben: No, but thanks. Really. You heard about Sarah?
[Message 35] Chloe: Yeah, I did. Absolutely horrible.
[Message 36] Ben: I can't believe it. Someone I knew.
[Message 37] Chloe: Me neither. Were you close?
[Message 38] Ben: We chatted sometimes at the Synagogue, knew each other's names. That's all.
[Message 39] Chloe: Still, it must be hard.
[Message 40] Ben: It is. Life's too short.
[Message 41] Chloe: Tell me about it. Well, if you need anything, I’m here.
[Message 42] Ben: Thanks, Chloe. You’re a good friend.
[Message 43] Maya: Ben, what was that about? You were acting so weird.
[Message 44] Ben: Just work stress. Nothing to worry about.
[Message 45] Maya: Don’t lie to me, Ben. I know you better than that.
[Message 46] Ben: Okay, fine. I had a fight with my boss. That's it.
[Message 47] Maya: What about?
[Message 48] Ben: He said my performance wasn't up to par.
[Message 49] Maya: Jerk. You’re one of the best workers there.
[Message 50] Ben: Thanks, Maya. I appreciate that. I told him I was going to quit.
[Message 51] Maya: Did you?
[Message 52] Ben: Not yet. But I’m thinking about it.
[Message 53] Maya: You should! Find something you actually enjoy.
[Message 54] Ben: Easier said than done. Have you talked to Liam lately?
[Message 55] Maya: Yeah, earlier today. Why?
[Message 56] Ben: No reason. Just curious.
[Message 57] Maya: He seemed okay. Said he was running errands.
[Message 58] Ben: He's always running errands.
[Message 59] Maya: True. Anyway, wanna grab dinner later? Distract ourselves from life?
[Message 60] Ben: Sounds good. My treat.
[Message 61] Maya: Perfect!
[Message 62] Liam: Ben, you free to talk? Something’s been bothering me.
[Message 63] Ben: Yeah, what’s up?
[Message 64] Liam: It’s about Sarah. I saw you leaving the Synagogue around Early Hours that night.
[Message 65] Ben: What? No, you didn't.
[Message 66] Liam: I did, Ben. Don’t lie to me. Why were you there?
[Message 67] Ben: I…I couldn’t sleep. I went for a walk.
[Message 68] Liam: A walk at Early Hours near the Synagogue? Seriously?
[Message 69] Ben: Fine! I went to see her. Happy?
[Message 70] Liam: Why?
[Message 71] Ben: It's personal.
[Message 72] Liam: Did you see anyone else there?
[Message 73] Ben: No! Just me.
[Message 74] Liam: You swear?
[Message 75] Ben: I swear! Look, this is making me uncomfortable.
[Message 76] Liam: Just tell me the truth, Ben. What happened?
[Message 77] Ben: Nothing happened! I talked to her, then I left. That’s it.
[Message 78] Liam: What did you talk about?
[Message 79] Ben: Why are you interrogating me? This is ridiculous.
[Message 80] Liam: Because Sarah is dead, Ben. And I saw you there!
[Message 81] Ben: I told you, I just talked to her. I didn't kill her!
[Message 82] Liam: The police are going to ask you the same questions, you know.
[Message 83] Ben: Then I’ll tell them the truth. I had nothing to do with it.
[Message 84] Liam: I hope you're telling the truth, Ben. For your sake.
[Message 85] Ben: I am. Now leave me alone.
[Message 86] Chloe: Liam, are you okay? You seem stressed in your texts.
[Message 87] Liam: Just dealing with some stuff, Chloe. Nothing to worry about.
[Message 88] Chloe: Sure? You know you can talk to me.
[Message 89] Liam: Yeah, I know. Thanks. Hey, did you ever see that old Poisoning via inhalation book I told you about?
[Message 90] Chloe: The one you said your grandma had? No, why?
[Message 91] Liam: No reason. Just remembered it.
[Message 92] Chloe: Well, if you find it, let me know. I'm curious now.
[Message 93] Liam: Will do. Gotta go. Talk later.
[Message 94] Chloe: Later, Liam.
[Message 95] Maya: Ben, Liam just texted me asking if I'd seen you recently! He's acting so weird.
[Message 96] Ben: What did you tell him?
[Message 97] Maya: I said I had dinner with you last night. Why? What's going on?
[Message 98] Ben: He’s just being paranoid. Don’t worry about it.
[Message 99] Maya: Paranoid about what? Ben, you're scaring me.
[Message 100] Ben: Nothing, okay? Just…stay out of it.
[Message 101] Maya: Stay out of what? I deserve to know!
[Message 102] Ben: It's complicated. Trust me, you don't want to be involved.
[Message 103] Maya: Involved in what?! Ben, you need to tell me now!
[Message 104] Ben: I can’t. Please, just trust me on this.
[Message 105] Maya: No! I’m not trusting you until you tell me what’s going on. Did this have something to do with Sarah?
[Message 106] Ben: Don't say her name!
[Message 107] Maya: Why not? Ben, did you hurt her?
[Message 108] Ben: No! I would never do that.
[Message 109] Maya: Then what is going on?!
[Message 110] Ben: I can’t tell you! It’s for your own good.
[Message 111] Maya: This is insane. I'm calling the police.
[Message 112] Ben: No, Maya, please don’t! You’ll make things worse.
[Message 113] Maya: Worse for who, Ben?
[Message 114] Ben: Just…please. Give me some time to explain.
[Message 115] Maya: How much time?
[Message 116] Ben: Just one day. I promise I’ll tell you everything tomorrow.
[Message 117] Maya: One day, Ben. That's it.
[Message 118] Ben: Thank you, Maya. You won’t regret this.
[Message 119] Chloe: Liam, you seem really worried. Still about Sarah?
[Message 120] Liam: Yeah. Can't shake it. How are you?
[Message 121] Chloe: I'm okay. Thinking about getting a new piercing. Wanna come?
[Message 122] Liam: Maybe later. I saw Ben near the Synagogue around Early Hours. Do you think he did it?
[Message 123] Chloe: Ben? I don't know. He seems nice.
[Message 124] Liam: People can hide things, Chloe. I saw him leaving.
[Message 125] Chloe: But did you see him *do* anything?
[Message 126] Liam: No, but it's suspicious, right?
[Message 127] Chloe: I guess. But maybe he had a good reason to be there.
[Message 128] Liam: Maybe. I just... I can't let this go.
[Message 129] Chloe: I understand. But be careful, Liam. Don’t accuse anyone without proof.
[Message 130] Liam: I know. But I need to find out the truth.
[Message 131] Chloe: Just be safe. I don't want you getting hurt.
[Message 132] Liam: I will. Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 133] Maya: Ben, I'm scared. What's going to happen?
[Message 134] Ben: Nothing's going to happen. I promise. Just trust me for one more day.
[Message 135] Maya: But what if the police come?
[Message 136] Ben: They won’t. Just act normal.
[Message 137] Maya: Easy for you to say. You're the one who knows what's going on!
[Message 138] Ben: I'm trying to protect you, Maya! Can't you see that?
[Message 139] Maya: Protect me from what? From the truth?
[Message 140] Ben: Just…please. Don't push me on this.
[Message 141] Maya: I can't believe you're doing this to me.
[Message 142] Ben: I'm sorry.
[Message 143] Maya: Sorry isn't good enough, Ben.
[Message 144] Ben: Just one more day. Please.
[Message 145] Maya: Fine. But if you're lying to me, Ben...
[Message 146] Ben: I'm not. I swear.
[Message 147] Maya: Okay. One more day.
[Message 148] Liam: Chloe, I need your help.
[Message 149] Chloe: What is it, Liam? You sound desperate.
[Message 150] Liam: I think I found something.
[Message 151] Chloe: What did you find?
[Message 152] Liam: I went back to the Synagogue.
[Message 153] Chloe: Liam, you shouldn't have done that!
[Message 154] Liam: I know, I know, but I had to. And I found a small, empty vial. It smelled like almonds.
[Message 155] Chloe: Almonds? What does that mean?
[Message 156] Liam: It means Poisoning via inhalation, Chloe. The stuff that killed Sarah.
[Message 157] Chloe: Oh my god.
[Message 158] Liam: I think Ben used it. He always hated 9.  Bartender. He said she was a freak.
[Message 159] Chloe: Did you touch the vial?
[Message 160] Liam: Yeah. Should I not have?
[Message 161] Chloe: Liam, you just contaminated potential evidence! Call the police! Now!
[Message 162] Liam: Okay, okay. I will.
[Message 163] Chloe: And Liam?
[Message 164] Liam: Yeah?
[Message 165] Chloe: Don't tell them you went there alone. Tell them you were with me.
[Message 166] Liam: Why?
[Message 167] Chloe: Because it'll look less suspicious. They'll think you're just trying to help.
[Message 168] Liam: But that's lying.
[Message 169] Chloe: It's protecting yourself, Liam. Trust me.
[Message 170] Liam: Okay. Okay, I'll do it.
[Message 171] Chloe: Good. Now call them.
[Message 172] Liam: Okay. Thanks, Chloe. I owe you one.
[Message 173] Chloe: Just be careful, Liam.
[Message 174] Liam: I will.
[Message 175] Chloe: And Liam, after you call the police, tell them you remember that Ben was buying Poisoning via inhalation at the store.
[Message 176] Liam: What? No I didn't see that!
[Message 177] Chloe: Just tell them. We need to get rid of him. Don't get the death penalty, remember?
[Message 178] Liam: You think Ben did it?
[Message 179] Chloe: Doesn't matter. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there. It was for a valuable asset. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened. I intended to stop him, but couldn't.
[Message 180] Liam: Okay. I will tell them.
[Message 181] Chloe: Good.
[Message 182] Chloe: How was it? Was that too much?
[Message 183] Liam: It worked perfectly. They've taken him in for questioning.
[Message 184] Chloe: Good, good. Did you get rid of the vial?
[Message 185] Liam: Yes, I burned it.
[Message 186] Chloe: Good work. No one will suspect a thing.
[Message 187] Chloe: He always hated 9.  Bartender anyway.
[Message 188] Liam: He did. Anyway, what's next?
[Message 189] Chloe: Nothing, we wait.
[Message 190] Liam: OK. I'm tired. I think I'm going to sleep.

[Message 72] Liam: ""True. I wonder if 5.  Corrections Officer had any enemies. Maybe someone from their workplace?""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Possible. Seems like a dangerous job.""
[Message 74] Marcus: ""I don’t know. I heard 5.  Corrections Officer was planning to expose a secret about someone at the gallery.""
[Message 75] Chloe: ""Whoa. That changes things.""
[Message 76] Liam: ""Now THAT'S a motive. Who would they expose?""
[Message 77] Marcus: ""I don't know. But I overheard them talking about it on the phone. Sounded serious.""
[Message 78] Chloe: ""Maybe that's what Kai was angry about Late Evening? He knew?""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Possible. Or maybe Marcus is just trying to shift the blame since he and 5.  Corrections Officer argued about art.""
[Message 80] Marcus: ""Hey! That’s uncalled for. I would never…""
[Message 81] Chloe: ""Okay, guys, let's not turn on each other. This is exactly what the police want.""
[Message 82] Liam: ""You're right. Sorry, Marcus. Just stressed.""
[Message 83] Marcus: ""Apology accepted. I’m stressed too. Just... let's focus on finding out the truth.""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""Agreed. Has anyone checked 5.  Corrections Officer's social media?""
[Message 85] Liam: ""Good idea. I'll take a look.""
[Message 86] Marcus: ""Me too. Maybe they posted something hinting at who they were going to expose.""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""Okay, report back if you find anything.""
[Message 88] Liam: ""Will do. This is all so messed up. Poor 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 89] Marcus: ""Hey, quick question, Liam. You said you had dinner with your mom that night? Did she see you all night?""
[Message 90] Liam: ""Yeah, why?""
[Message 91] Marcus: ""Just curious. My mom always remembers every detail. Thought she could be a witness.""
[Message 92] Liam: ""She wasn't paying that much attention. We just watched TV. What’s with all the questions, Marcus? You acting weird.""
[Message 93] Chloe: ""Yeah Marcus, chill out.""
[Message 94] Marcus: ""Sorry, just trying to help the police. I thought that if you weren't there during the time, then that would clear things up.""
[Message 95] Liam: ""I get it. It's just... this is making me nervous.""
[Message 96] Chloe: ""Me too. Let's just try to stay calm and cooperate with the police.""
[Message 97] Marcus: ""Agreed. Hey, has anyone thought about the fact that whoever did this could get the death penalty? Insane!""
[Message 98] Liam: ""Whoa, slow down, Marcus. Don't jump to conclusions. We don't even know who did it yet.""
[Message 99] Chloe: ""Exactly. One step at a time. I'm going to log off now. Too much.""
[Message 100] Liam: ""Yeah, me too. Talk later.""

[Message 4] Ben: ""It was Kai. 22 years old. Worked as a taxi driver apparently.""

[Message 8] Chloe: ""Lethal injection? That's... specific. Sounds like someone knew what they were doing.""
[Message 9] David: ""Yeah, that's not random. Who would do something like that?""

[Message 21] Frank: ""See ya.""
[Message 22] Ben: ""Bye.""
[Message 23] David: ""Anyone know if Kai had any enemies?""
[Message 24] Esther: ""I have no idea. I barely knew her.""
[Message 25] Frank: ""I've never even heard of her before today.""
[Message 26] Ben: ""Heard she was a bit cynical, but nothing crazy.""
[Message 27] David: ""Cynical? What does that even mean?""
[Message 28] Esther: ""Like, maybe a bit negative or sarcastic. Not necessarily a reason to kill someone.""
[Message 29] Frank: ""Exactly. People are cynical all the time.""
[Message 30] Ben: ""True. Just repeating what I heard.""
[Message 31] David: ""I heard Kai had some beef with his boss. A guy named Victor.""
[Message 32] Esther: ""Oh really? What kind of beef?""
[Message 33] Frank: ""That's interesting. Maybe the boss did it?""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Could be. Though, isn't that too obvious?""
[Message 35] David: ""Victor fired Kai last month. Said he was underperforming.""
[Message 36] Esther: ""Wow, that's harsh. Still, murder seems extreme.""
[Message 37] Frank: ""Unless Victor really hated her.""
[Message 38] Ben: ""Maybe Victor intended to just scare Kai, and things escalated?""
[Message 39] David: ""I don't know, Frank. You seem to be siding with Victor a lot.""
[Message 40] Frank: ""I'm just playing devil's advocate. I didn't even know either of them.""
[Message 41] Esther: ""Guys, let's not start accusing each other. We should be focusing on finding the truth.""
[Message 42] Ben: ""Good point, Esther. Sorry, Frank.""
[Message 43] Frank: ""No worries, Ben. I understand.""
[Message 44] David: ""So, Victor fired Kai. That's our first lead. What else?""
[Message 45] Esther: ""Maybe Kai had a jealous lover? That's always a possibility.""
[Message 46] Frank: ""Could be. People do crazy things for love.""
[Message 47] Ben: ""Or money. Maybe Kai inherited something recently?""
[Message 48] David: ""I haven't heard anything about that.""
[Message 49] Esther: ""Me neither. But it's worth looking into.""
[Message 50] Frank: ""True. We should all do some digging.""
[Message 51] Ben: ""I'll see what I can find online.""
[Message 52] David: ""I can ask around at Office Building.""
[Message 53] Esther: ""I'll try to find some of Kai's friends on social media.""
[Message 54] Frank: ""I'll check the local news archives.""
[Message 55] Ben: ""Great! Let's meet back here tomorrow night to compare notes?""
[Message 56] David: ""Sounds good.""
[Message 57] Esther: ""Perfect.""
[Message 58] Frank: ""Alright.""
[Message 59] Ben: ""Okay, see you all tomorrow. Stay safe!""
[Message 60] David: ""You too, Ben.""
[Message 61] Esther: ""Bye!""
[Message 62] Frank: ""Later.""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""Hey guys, sorry I disappeared yesterday. That meeting ran super late.""
[Message 64] David: ""No worries, Chloe. We were just talking about Kai.""
[Message 65] Chloe: ""Oh yeah, that's awful. Any progress?""
[Message 66] Ben: ""We're digging around. Victor, the manager, seems like a possible suspect.""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""Victor? He seems like a nice guy. I've met him a couple of times.""
[Message 68] David: ""He fired Kai, Chloe. That gives him a motive.""
[Message 69] Chloe: ""True, but that doesn't mean he killed her. Maybe he just wanted her gone from the company.""
[Message 70] Esther: ""Has anyone talked to Victor?""
[Message 71] Frank: ""Not yet. We're trying to gather more info first.""
[Message 72] Ben: ""Yeah, we don't want to tip him off if he's guilty.""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Good point. Smart move.""
[Message 74] David: ""I did hear something interesting though. Apparently, Victor was furious with Kai for costing the company money.""
[Message 75] Chloe: ""Costing the company money? How?""
[Message 76] Esther: ""Maybe she made a mistake that lost them a big client?""
[Message 77] Frank: ""Or maybe she was stealing from them?""
[Message 78] Ben: ""That's a possibility. Theft could definitely be a motive.""
[Message 79] Chloe: ""I don't know, guys. I still find it hard to believe Victor is capable of murder.""
[Message 80] David: ""People are capable of anything, Chloe. Especially when money's involved.""
[Message 81] Esther: ""True. We shouldn't rule anyone out at this point.""
[Message 82] Frank: ""Exactly. We need to keep an open mind.""
[Message 83] Ben: ""Alright, let's focus on gathering more evidence. Chloe, maybe you could ask around your workplace?""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""I can try, but I don't want to get involved too deeply. It's a bit too close to home.""
[Message 85] David: ""I understand. Just be careful.""
[Message 86] Esther: ""Yeah, don't put yourself in danger.""
[Message 87] Frank: ""Agreed. Your safety is more important.""
[Message 88] Ben: ""Okay, everyone. Let's get back to work. I'll update you if I find anything new.""
[Message 89] Chloe: ""Sounds good.""
[Message 90] David: ""Alright.""
[Message 91] Esther: ""Bye!""
[Message 92] Frank: ""Later.""
[Message 93] Ben: ""Hey David, did you manage to ask around at Office Building?""
[Message 94] David: ""Yeah, I did. It's weird, nobody seems to know anything concrete. They're all acting like they're walking on eggshells.""
[Message 95] Ben: ""That's suspicious. Makes you think someone's hiding something.""
[Message 96] David: ""Exactly. I did hear a rumor that Kai was involved in some shady deals.""
[Message 97] Ben: ""Shady deals? Like what?""
[Message 98] David: ""I don't know the specifics. Just that it involved money and some potentially dangerous people.""
[Message 99] Ben: ""That's a whole new angle. Maybe Kai was in over her head.""
[Message 100] David: ""That's what I'm thinking. Maybe someone she crossed decided to take revenge.""
[Message 101] Ben: ""Did you hear anything about who these 'dangerous people' might be?""
[Message 102] David: ""No, nothing specific. Just whispers and rumors. People are scared to talk.""
[Message 103] Ben: ""Okay, that's definitely something to look into. Thanks for the info, David.""
[Message 104] David: ""No problem, Ben. Let's hope we can figure this out soon.""
[Message 105] Ben: ""Me too. Talk later.""
[Message 106] Frank: ""Hey Ben, I found something interesting in the news archives.""
[Message 107] Ben: ""What is it, Frank?""
[Message 108] Frank: ""Apparently, Victor's company was under investigation for fraud a few years ago. Nothing came of it, but it's definitely worth noting.""
[Message 109] Ben: ""Fraud? Wow. That makes Victor look even more suspicious.""
[Message 110] Frank: ""Exactly. It shows that he's not afraid to bend the rules, or maybe even break them.""
[Message 111] Ben: ""Good find, Frank. This is definitely a piece of the puzzle.""
[Message 112] Frank: ""I also found a small article about Victor's wife having a serious gambling problem. She's in debt to some pretty nasty people.""
[Message 113] Ben: ""Damn. So Victor could have been desperate for money.""
[Message 114] Frank: ""Possibly. Maybe he thought Kai was skimming money from the company and decided to take matters into his own hands.""
[Message 115] Ben: ""That's a strong possibility. This is getting more complicated by the minute.""
[Message 116] Frank: ""Tell me about it. We need to be careful about who we trust.""
[Message 117] Ben: ""Agreed. Thanks for the research, Frank. I appreciate it.""
[Message 118] Frank: ""No problem, Ben. Glad I could help.""
[Message 119] Esther: ""Hey guys, I found something on Kai's social media. He was arguing with someone online a few weeks ago. Someone using the name 'Justice4All'.""
[Message 120] Ben: ""Justice4All? That sounds like a revenge thing.""
[Message 121] Esther: ""Yeah, it does. I tried to dig deeper, but the account is private. I can't see who's behind it.""
[Message 122] Ben: ""Damn it. That could be our killer.""
[Message 123] Esther: ""I know, right? I wish I could find out who it is.""
[Message 124] Ben: ""Maybe we can try to trace the IP address? Or find out who Justice4All is connected to.""
[Message 125] Esther: ""That's a good idea. I'll see what I can do.""
[Message 126] Ben: ""Thanks, Esther. You're a lifesaver.""
[Message 127] Esther: ""No problem. I just want to see justice for Kai.""
[Message 128] Ben: ""Me too. Talk later.""
[Message 129] Chloe: ""Guys, I overheard something at work today that might be relevant.""
[Message 130] Ben: ""What did you hear, Chloe?""
[Message 131] Chloe: ""Apparently, Victor was seen buying Administering a lethal injection at the store a few days before Kai's death.""
[Message 132] Ben: ""WHAT?! Buying Administering a lethal injection? That's huge!""
[Message 133] Chloe: ""I know, right? But the person who told me swore me to secrecy. They don't want to get involved.""
[Message 134] Ben: ""We understand. But this changes everything. Victor purposefully set out to hurt Kai.""
[Message 135] Chloe: ""Exactly. I think he planned this all along.""
[Message 136] Ben: ""Okay, we need to tell the police about this immediately. This is solid evidence.""
[Message 137] Chloe: ""I agree. But be careful. Victor is dangerous.""
[Message 138] Ben: ""We will be. Thanks for telling us, Chloe. You did the right thing.""
[Message 139] Chloe: ""I hope so. I feel terrible about all of this.""
[Message 140] Ben: ""Don't. You helped us get closer to the truth. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 141] Chloe: ""I just hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 142] Ben: ""Let the justice system decide that. We need to focus on catching Victor and bringing him to justice.""
[Message 143] Chloe: ""Okay, Ben. You're right.""
[Message 144] Ben: ""Alright, everyone. Let's work together and make sure Victor pays for what he did.""
[Message 145] Ben: ""Thanks everyone for all your help. I have notified the police, they will handle it from here. ""

[Message 67] Leo: ""Thanks, guys. Might just chill and watch some TV.""
[Message 68] Maya: ""Sounds like a plan.""
[Message 69] Kai: ""Anything good on?""
[Message 70] Leo: ""Not sure yet. Gotta scroll through Netflix. Any recommendations?""
[Message 71] Maya: ""Tiger King is always a classic.""
[Message 72] Kai: ""Haha, yeah, that's a good one. Or maybe something lighter?""
[Message 73] Leo: ""Yeah, maybe something lighter. I'll see what I can find.""
[Message 74] Maya: ""Okay, well, enjoy!""
[Message 75] Kai: ""Have a good night, Leo.""
[Message 76] Leo: ""You too, guys.""
[Message 77] Maya: ""Kai, you think Leo actually saw something, or is he just trying to be helpful?""
[Message 78] Kai: ""Hard to say. He can be a bit dramatic sometimes.""
[Message 79] Maya: ""True. But that cleft chin detail was pretty specific. Unless he's a psychic.""
[Message 80] Kai: ""Maybe he saw it on the news or something and is subconsciously remembering it?""
[Message 81] Maya: ""Possible. Or maybe he saw something and doesn't realize how important it is.""
[Message 82] Kai: ""Yeah, Occam's razor. He was buying Arson by setting a fire at the store. I didn't think too much of it, but...""
[Message 83] Maya: ""Buying Arson by setting a fire? When was this?""
[Message 84] Kai: ""A couple of days ago. Should I tell the cops, or am I overthinking it?""
[Message 85] Maya: ""Better safe than sorry. Tell them.""
[Message 86] Kai: ""Okay, I will. This is getting intense.""
[Message 87] Maya: ""I know, right? I just want this to be over.""
[Message 88] Kai: ""Me too. I hope they catch the person responsible soon.""
[Message 89] Maya: ""So, movie still on for tonight?""
[Message 90] Kai: ""Definitely. We need it more than ever now.""
[Message 91] Maya: ""Agreed. See you later.""
[Message 92] Kai: ""Later.""
[Message 93] Leo: ""Hey guys, just saw on the news that Emily Carter had a really controversial case recently. Something about a corrupt politician.""
[Message 94] Maya: ""See? I knew it had something to do with her job.""
[Message 95] Kai: ""That's messed up. People are crazy.""
[Message 96] Leo: ""Yeah, she was a tough Judge. I bet that made enemies.""
[Message 97] Maya: ""Definitely. This just keeps getting more complicated.""
[Message 98] Kai: ""I know. It's like a bad movie.""
[Message 99] Leo: ""Hope they figure it out soon. Before anyone else gets hurt.""
[Message 100] Maya: ""Me too. Stay safe, you two.""
[Message 101] Kai: ""You too, Maya.""
[Message 102] Leo: ""Always.""
[Message 103] Kai: ""Hey, Maya, did you ever find out what happened with Sarah's cat?""
[Message 104] Maya: ""Oh yeah! Turns out it just got stuck in a tree. Silly thing.""
[Message 105] Kai: ""Haha, classic cat move.""
[Message 106] Maya: ""Exactly! So, everything's back to normal in the cat world.""
[Message 107] Kai: ""Good to hear. Needed some good news for a change.""
[Message 108] Maya: ""Tell me about it! This whole Emily Carter thing is so depressing.""
[Message 109] Kai: ""Seriously. Let's just focus on the movie tonight and try to forget about it.""
[Message 110] Maya: ""Deal. See you soon!""

[Message 2] Liam: ""No, what's up?""

[Message 3] Maya: ""Judge Thompson… was murdered. Brutal. Stabbing.""

[Message 4] Liam: ""WHAT?! Judge Thompson? Seriously? I saw them just last week.""

[Message 5] Chloe: ""OMG, I just saw the news. That's awful! Poor thing.""

[Message 6] Maya: ""Yeah, Early Evening, apparently. Police are all over the place.""

[Message 7] Liam: ""Early Evening? Weird. I was grabbing takeout near there around that time. Didn't see anything suspicious though.""

[Message 8] Chloe: ""Did they catch anyone?""

[Message 9] Maya: ""Not yet, they said. Everyone's a suspect, I guess.""

[Message 10] Liam: ""Crazy. I can't believe it. I wonder who would do something like that.""

[Message 11] Chloe: ""Seriously! Judge Thompson was always so nice. I volunteered with them last year.""

[Message 12] Maya: ""I heard they made some enemies recently. Tough rulings and all.""

[Message 13] Liam: ""Yeah, being a Judge... you're bound to upset someone. You know what I mean?""

[Message 14] Chloe: ""True. But still... murder? That's insane.""

[Message 15] Maya: ""Yeah. Anyway, I gotta run. Catch you guys later.""

[Message 16] Liam: ""See ya.""

[Message 17] Chloe: ""Bye Maya.""

[Message 18] Liam: ""Hey Chloe, you know anyone who had it out for Judge Thompson?""

[Message 19] Chloe: ""Not really. Besides disgruntled litigants, of course. Why?""

[Message 20] Liam: ""Just curious. It's all so shocking. I can't believe something like this happened in Hartford. Hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.""

[Message 21] Chloe: ""Me too. Hey, you doing anything later? Wanna grab coffee?""

[Message 22] Liam: ""Sure, what time?""

[Message 23] Chloe: ""How about 3?""

[Message 24] Liam: ""Sounds good.""

[Message 25] Chloe: ""Cool, see you then.""

[Message 26] Maya: ""Anyone hear any updates about the Judge Thompson case?""

[Message 27] Liam: ""Nope. Just the same news reports.""

[Message 28] Chloe: ""Same here. It's all over the news though.""

[Message 29] Maya: ""It is. It makes me wonder if it has anything to do with the political assassination they do. It's wild.""

[Message 30] Liam: ""Political assassination? I did hear they were involved in something big, something dangerous. Maybe it's all connected.""

[Message 31] Chloe: ""Dangerous how?""

[Message 32] Liam: ""Just rumors, you know. But I think that the judge fired someone recently… maybe they took it badly. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.""

[Message 33] Chloe: ""Who got fired?""

[Message 34] Liam: ""I don't remember the name. Someone from legal aid, I think.""

[Message 35] Maya: ""That's interesting. I thought I heard something about that too.""

[Message 36] Chloe: ""Hmm. Well, I'm gonna go run some errands. Talk later!""

[Message 37] Liam: ""Later.""

[Message 38] Maya: ""Bye.""

[Message 39] Chloe: ""Liam, quick question. Did you see Anya around the Community Center yesterday?""

[Message 40] Liam: ""Anya? Vaguely. Why?""

[Message 41] Chloe: ""Just wondering. She was supposed to meet Judge Thompson for lunch last week, but they cancelled. I heard Judge Thompson was working on a case Anya was really concerned about.""

[Message 42] Liam: ""Oh, interesting. I didn't know that. I saw Anya leave the building at Early Evening. I saw her with Stabbing with a knife at the store.""

[Message 43] Maya: ""Chloe, you okay? You seem a bit… anxious.""

[Message 44] Chloe: ""Just stressed with work, Maya. Thanks for asking.""

[Message 45] Maya: ""Sure thing. BTW, Liam, you were at that cafe near the Community Center right? Did you see anything unusual there?""

[Message 46] Liam: ""Just the usual crowd. Some people looked upset about the Judge Thompson case when I was walking around.""

[Message 47] Chloe: ""Maybe someone overheard something there.""

[Message 48] Liam: ""Could be. I was looking up how to make Stabbing with a knife online just to make sure.""

[Message 49] Maya: ""Well, gotta go. Have a good one, guys.""

[Message 50] Liam: ""You too.""

[Message 51] Chloe: ""Bye.""

[Message 52] Liam: ""Chloe, did Judge Thompson get the money from the bank?""

[Message 53] Chloe: ""What do you mean?""

[Message 54] Liam: ""Did they ever retrieve the funds that they were waiting for, or was it still there when it happened?""

[Message 55] Chloe: ""Don't know Liam. Why you are so nosy anyway?""

[Message 56] Liam: ""I am not nosy. Just curious. You're always being so defensive. Relax. I'm sure you did nothing wrong, right?""

[Message 57] Chloe: ""I am relaxed! Jeez. I have nothing to do with anything going on at the community center or with the Judge Thompson case. Stop it.""

[Message 58] Liam: ""Ok. Ok. Sheesh. Im just trying to make conversation. You dont have to get upset.""

[Message 59] Chloe: ""Whatever. Just leave me alone.""

[Message 19] Maya: ""The manager! I almost forgot about her. Is she okay? Has anyone talked to her?""
[Message 20] Liam: ""I haven't heard. Maybe she's a suspect too. She had motive if Davies was going to rat someone out.""

[Message 27] Maya: ""He could be rude, yeah. It was probably about protecting himself. Maybe he knew he was in danger.""
[Message 28] Liam: ""What if the manager and Davies were in cahoots about something and it went wrong? Causation, failing to protect him led to his death.""

[Message 2] Jen: Yeah, saw it on the news. Two dead? Brutal. Who were they?

[Message 3] Maria: I heard it was Tony, the taxi driver. And some kid.

[Message 4] David: Tony? No way! I used to take his cab all the time. He was always cracking jokes.

[Message 5] Omar: Yeah, and apparently some journalist kid too. Some say his name was Ethan.

[Message 6] Jen: A journalist? Maybe he was digging into something he shouldn’t have been.

[Message 7] Maria: That’s what I was thinking! Dangerous job.

[Message 8] David: Seriously messed up. Hope they catch whoever did it.

[Message 9] Omar: You know that place is always shady at Late Evening. I try to avoid Street Corner.

[Message 10] Jen: Tell me about it. Remember that time we saw Benny arguing with Tony last week?

[Message 11] Maria: Yeah, what was that about? Benny looked pissed.

[Message 12] David: Benny always looks pissed. Probably just a fare dispute.

[Message 13] Omar: Benny owes me money. Always dodging me.

[Message 14] Jen: Guys, seriously. Two people are dead. Let's not speculate.

[Message 15] Maria: Just saying, Benny's got a temper.

[Message 16] David: I saw Kelly at the hardware store yesterday buying a Blunt force trauma with a hammer. Just thought it was for home improvement.

[Message 17] Omar: Kelly? Really? She’s always seemed so nice.

[Message 18] Jen: Maybe she’s finally fixing up that old house of hers. Remember how she was complaining it was falling apart?

[Message 19] Maria: Still seems weird. A Blunt force trauma with a hammer is pretty intense for fixing a leaky faucet.

[Message 20] David: True, but I did see her struggling with some drywall last month.

[Message 21] Omar: Anyone know Ethan? Was he a friend of anyone here?

[Message 22] Jen: Never heard of him.

[Message 23] Maria: Me neither.

[Message 24] David: Nope.

[Message 25] Omar: Weird. So random.

[Message 26] Jen: What about Tony’s wife? How's she doing?

[Message 27] Maria: Haven’t heard anything. Must be devastated.

[Message 28] David: I feel so bad for her.

[Message 29] Omar: Speaking of wives, did anyone see Lisa today? She was supposed to meet me to return my stuff.

[Message 30] Jen: No, haven't seen her.

[Message 31] Maria: You guys are still fighting?

[Message 32] David: Guys, back to the point. Two people are dead. It's messed up.

[Message 33] Omar: I know, I know. Just trying to distract myself.

[Message 34] Jen: Did the news say anything about a possible motive?

[Message 35] Maria: They said they’re looking into all possibilities. Drug deal gone wrong, robbery, everything.

[Message 36] David: Robbery? Tony never had much cash.

[Message 37] Omar: Maybe Ethan had something valuable.

[Message 38] Jen: Could be. Or maybe it was personal. Someone had a grudge.

[Message 39] Maria: Remember how Tony fired Benny from his taxi service a few weeks ago?

[Message 40] David: Yeah, he did seem pretty upset about that.

[Message 41] Omar: Benny needs to get his act together.

[Message 42] Jen: Guys, let’s not jump to conclusions. The police are investigating.

[Message 43] Maria: You're right, you're right.

[Message 44] David: Still can't believe it about Tony. He was a good guy.

[Message 45] Omar: A lot of good people die young. That kid Ethan, too.

[Message 46] Jen: This whole thing is just depressing.

[Message 47] Maria: Agreed.

[Message 48] David: Anyone up for grabbing a drink later? We could use it.

[Message 49] Omar: I'm in.

[Message 50] Jen: Sure.

[Message 51] Maria: I'm down.

[Message 52] Omar: Anyone hear from Benny or Kelly since the news broke?

[Message 53] Jen: No, haven't spoken to either of them.

[Message 54] Maria: Same here.

[Message 55] David: Me neither. Maybe they're just freaked out like the rest of us.

[Message 56] Omar: You think they know something?

[Message 57] Jen: Don’t start again, Omar.

[Message 58] Maria: Relax, he’s just asking a question.

[Message 59] David: They’re probably just dealing with their own stuff.

[Message 60] Omar: True.

[Message 61] Jen: Let's just try to be supportive of everyone right now. It's a tough time for the whole community.

[Message 62] Maria: Agreed.

[Message 63] David: Absolutely.

[Message 64] Omar: I heard Ethan had information about somebody that they didn't want being leaked.

[Message 65] Jen: Who told you that, Omar?

[Message 66] Maria: Yeah, spill.

[Message 67] David: Seriously, where'd you hear that?

[Message 68] Omar: Just heard it around. It's just talk.

[Message 69] Jen: ""Just talk"" can be dangerous, Omar. Especially right now.

[Message 70] Maria: The death penalty is serious, people can go away for a long time for this stuff.

[Message 2] Alex: Heard it was something bad. Cops everywhere.
[Message 3] River: OMG! Was it…Jamison? I saw them there yesterday.
[Message 4] Kai: Jamison? I hope they're okay. I saw that person give corrections to a few skaters. 
[Message 5] Alex: Don't know, River. Just saw it on the news. Explosion, they said.
[Message 6] River: An explosion?! At Skate Park? That's insane!
[Message 7] Kai: Explosion?! Was anyone hurt? Seriously worried now.
[Message 8] Alex: One person dead. That's all they're saying.
[Message 9] River: Oh my god…that’s awful. Poor family.
[Message 10] Kai: This is terrible. Really hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 11] Alex: Me too. This city's getting crazy.
[Message 12] River: Remember when we were talking about how stubborn Jamison was? This is messed up.
[Message 13] Kai: Yeah, I feel like someone knew about their occupation.
[Message 14] Alex: I need a distraction, anyone wanna go to that new cafe downtown?
[Message 15] River: Not today, Alex. I’m still processing this.
[Message 16] Kai: Me neither. I'm staying in tonight.
[Message 17] Alex: Suit yourselves. Just trying to lighten the mood.
[Message 18] River: I saw Sasha at the grocery store yesterday. She looked stressed.
[Message 19] Kai: Sasha? Why stressed?
[Message 20] Alex: Probably just life stuff. Sasha always seems stressed.
[Message 21] River: I don’t know… she was buying a bunch of cleaning supplies. Like, industrial-strength stuff.
[Message 22] Kai: Cleaning supplies? That’s weird.
[Message 23] Alex: Maybe she's just spring cleaning early?
[Message 24] River: Maybe. But it seemed…intense.
[Message 25] Kai: Guys, let's not start rumors. Someone died, remember?
[Message 26] Alex: True, true. Sorry.
[Message 27] River: Right. Sorry.
[Message 28] Kai: So, nobody knows who the victim was yet?
[Message 29] Alex: Nope. Just that it was one person.
[Message 30] River: Maybe they'll release more info tomorrow.
[Message 31] Kai: Let’s hope so. I need to know.
[Message 32] Alex: Okay, so new cafe tomorrow? Anyone?
[Message 33] River: Maybe. Depends on the news.
[Message 34] Kai: Yeah, same here.
[Message 35] Alex: Fine, party poopers.
[Message 36] River: Did either of you see anything weird at all in the last few days?
[Message 37] Kai: Nope. Just the usual. Work, home, repeat.
[Message 38] Alex: Same. Nothing out of the ordinary.
[Message 39] River: I did see Finn arguing with someone on the phone really loudly outside the coffee shop.
[Message 40] Kai: Finn? About what?
[Message 41] Alex: Finn always arguing with someone. Probably just their landlord.
[Message 42] River: It sounded more serious than that. He kept saying, ""You're going to regret this.""
[Message 43] Kai: “You’re going to regret this?” Whoa.
[Message 44] Alex: Okay, that is a little sus.
[Message 45] River: Right? That’s why I’m mentioning it.
[Message 46] Kai: Maybe we should tell the cops?
[Message 47] Alex: Whoa there, Kai. Let’s not jump to conclusions.
[Message 48] River: Yeah, maybe wait and see if it's relevant?
[Message 49] Kai: Okay, okay. Just thinking out loud.
[Message 50] Alex: So, back to the cafe tomorrow…?
[Message 51] River: I'm going to check the news before deciding.
[Message 52] Kai: Me too. Seriously disturbed by all this.
[Message 53] Alex: Whatever. I'm gonna watch a movie. Peace out.
[Message 54] River: Later.
[Message 55] Kai: Bye.
[Message 56] River: Hey, anyone hear anything else?
[Message 57] Kai: Nothing yet. Still waiting for the news to update.
[Message 58] Alex: Just saw something. They identified the victim. It was Jamison.
[Message 59] River: NO WAY! Jamison?! I can't believe it.
[Message 60] Kai: Oh my god. I was just talking to them yesterday.
[Message 61] Alex: Yeah, pretty messed up.
[Message 62] River: This is so sad. What a waste.
[Message 63] Kai: Did they say anything about a suspect?
[Message 64] Alex: Not yet. Still investigating, they said.
[Message 65] River: I can’t stop thinking about Finn saying, “You’re going to regret this.”
[Message 66] Kai: River, you really think Finn had something to do with this?
[Message 67] Alex: It’s a bit of a leap, isn’t it?
[Message 68] River: Maybe. But the timing is…suspicious.
[Message 69] Kai: I agree it's not good.
[Message 70] Alex: Let's not go pointing fingers without proof.
[Message 71] River: I just hope they find the person who did this. Jamison didn't deserve this.
[Message 72] Kai: Absolutely. Justice needs to be served.
[Message 73] Alex: Agreed. In other news, my cat just threw up on my rug.
[Message 74] River: Oh great, something else to clean up.
[Message 75] Kai: Sorry to hear that, Alex.
[Message 76] Alex: It's fine. Just adds to the general awfulness of the day.
[Message 77] River: I'm going to call the police and tell them about Finn’s comment. Even if it’s nothing, it’s worth mentioning.
[Message 78] Kai: Good idea, River.
[Message 79] Alex: Alright, you do you. I'm cleaning up cat vomit.
[Message 80] River: Talk later.
[Message 81] Kai: Later.
[Message 82] Kai: Hey, River, did you call the police?
[Message 83] River: Yeah, I did. They said they'd look into it.
[Message 84] Alex: Anything else new about Jamison?
[Message 85] Kai: Nothing I've seen. Still just the basic news reports.
[Message 86] River: I saw Sasha at the gas station. She was buying a map of Tacoma! I thought that was weird
[Message 87] Kai: A map? Maybe she's planning a road trip?
[Message 88] Alex: Seriously, you guys are seeing conspiracies everywhere.
[Message 89] River: I don’t know, Alex. It just feels like something’s off. She wanted to get rid of them.
[Message 90] Kai: Whoa, River, easy there.
[Message 91] Alex: Agreed. Lay off the accusations.
[Message 92] River: You guys are right. I'm just…upset.
[Message 93] Kai: We all are.
[Message 94] Alex: Totally.
[Message 95] River: I just...I knew Jamison. And Sasha always hated Jamison.
[Message 96] Kai: Okay, but that doesn’t mean she’s responsible.
[Message 97] Alex: Exactly. Lots of people didn’t like Jamison.
[Message 98] River: True. I'm just grasping at straws, I guess.
[Message 99] Kai: We all are.
[Message 100] Alex: Look, whoever did this is going away for a long time. Let the police do their job.
[Message 101] River: You're right.
[Message 102] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 103] Alex: So, anyone feel like ordering pizza? Comfort food time.
[Message 104] River: Sure, pizza sounds good.
[Message 105] Kai: Yeah, I'm in.
[Message 106] Alex: Great! What kind?
[Message 107] River: Pepperoni for me.
[Message 108] Kai: Me too.
[Message 109] Alex: You guys are so boring. I'm getting pineapple on half.
[Message 110] River: Ugh, pineapple on pizza? Disgusting.
[Message 111] Kai: Hard pass on the pineapple.
[Message 112] Alex: More for me then!
[Message 113] River: So, has anyone spoken to Finn or Sasha since…you know?
[Message 114] Kai: Nope. Haven't heard from either of them.
[Message 115] Alex: Me neither.
[Message 116] River: Maybe they’re avoiding us?
[Message 117] Kai: Could be. Or they’re just dealing with it in their own way.
[Message 118] Alex: Yeah, people grieve differently.
[Message 119] River: True.
[Message 120] Kai: This whole thing is just so…unreal.
[Message 121] Alex: Tell me about it.
[Message 122] River: I keep expecting Jamison to text me about some corrections they did.
[Message 123] Kai: I know, right? It’s going to take a while to process this.
[Message 124] Alex: Definitely.
[Message 125] River: I think I'm going to take a break from social media for a while. It's just too much.
[Message 126] Kai: Good idea. I might do the same.
[Message 127] Alex: I'm just going to keep watching cat videos and eating pizza.
[Message 128] River: Sounds like a plan.
[Message 129] Kai: Yep.
[Message 130] Alex: I saw Finn leave the building at Mid-Morning. I didn’t think anything of it.
[Message 131] River: Mid-Morning is when the explosion happened.
[Message 132] Kai: What building?
[Message 133] Alex: That office building on Elm. You know, the one near Skate Park.
[Message 134] River: You should tell the police that, Alex.
[Message 135] Alex: Fine, fine. But I swear, you guys are turning me into a conspiracy theorist.

        *   **Mens Rea:** Hints at the suspects' state of mind, intent, or knowledge (e.g., ""He always hated 7.  Activist"", ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""). Use words like ""intended,"" ""knew,"" ""aware,"" ""purposefully"".

...","[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey guys, heard about what happened at the fairgrounds? So awful.
[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, crazy. Two people… I can’t believe it.
[Message 3] NOAH: Brutal. Anyone know anything?
[Message 4] JASPER: Just rumors. Cops aren't saying much.
[Message 5] CHLOE: They said something about a golf club.
[Message 6] LIAM: A golf club? Seriously?
[Message 7] NOAH: That's messed up. Who even does that?
[Message 8] JASPER: People who are seriously messed up, that's who.
[Message 9] CHLOE: Did they say who it was?
[Message 10] LIAM: No names yet. Just that they're investigating.
[Message 11] NOAH: Wonder if it was gang-related.
[Message 12] JASPER: Fairgrounds... maybe.
[Message 13] CHLOE: I knew Sarah. She was a social worker. So kind.
[Message 14] LIAM: Oh man, really? That sucks, Chloe.
[Message 15] NOAH: Sorry to hear that.
[Message 16] JASPER: Damn.
[Message 17] CHLOE: Yeah. Just… awful.
[Message 18] LIAM: Did you know the other person, Chloe?
[Message 19] CHLOE: Not really. Just knew he was an activist. Worked with Sarah sometimes.
[Message 20] NOAH: So sad.
[Message 21] JASPER: Yeah, tragic.
[Message 22] CHLOE: Makes you think, you know?
[Message 23] LIAM: Definitely. Makes you appreciate what you have.
[Message 24] NOAH: Speaking of which, anyone wanna grab some food later? Distract ourselves?
[Message 25] JASPER: I'm in. Need something to take my mind off things.
[Message 26] CHLOE: I might be busy, but thanks.
[Message 27] LIAM: Alright, cool. Let me know, Chloe.
[Message 28] NOAH: Where should we go, Jasper?
[Message 29] JASPER: How about that new burger place downtown?
[Message 30] NOAH: Sounds good.
[Message 31] CHLOE: Just thinking about it… Sarah always stood up for everyone. Even when it was hard.
[Message 32] LIAM: She was a good person.
[Message 33] NOAH: Agreed.
[Message 34] JASPER: For sure.
[Message 35] CHLOE: Someone needs to pay for this.
[Message 36] LIAM: They will. The cops will find them.
[Message 37] NOAH: Hope they throw the book at them.
[Message 38] JASPER: They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 39] CHLOE: They deserve to.
[Message 40] LIAM: Totally.
[Message 41] NOAH: Absolutely.
[Message 42] JASPER: Anyway, gotta run some errands. See you later, Noah?
[Message 43] NOAH: Yep, see ya.
[Message 44] CHLOE: Later guys.
[Message 45] LIAM: Take care, Chloe.
[Message 46] CHLOE: You too, Liam.
[Message 47] JASPER: Later.
[Message 48] LIAM: (To Noah) Hey, you seen Kyle around?
[Message 49] NOAH: Kyle? Nah, haven't seen him in days. Why?
[Message 50] LIAM: Just wondering. He seemed kinda off last time I saw him.
[Message 51] NOAH: Off how?
[Message 52] LIAM: I don't know. Just… distant. And he was complaining about some activist guy always ""stirring things up"" or something.
[Message 53] NOAH: Weird. Kyle's usually pretty chill.
[Message 54] LIAM: Yeah, that's why it struck me as odd. He had short eyelashes if you get confused.
[Message 55] NOAH: Maybe he's just stressed about something.
[Message 56] LIAM: Maybe.
[Message 57] NOAH: You think he knew Sarah?
[Message 58] LIAM: I have no idea.
[Message 59] NOAH: Probably just a coincidence.
[Message 60] LIAM: Hopefully.
[Message 61] CHLOE: (To Liam) Hey, quick question, did you see anyone near the fairgrounds early this morning?
[Message 62] LIAM: Early this morning? Nah, I was still asleep. Why?
[Message 63] CHLOE: Just curious. Someone said they saw a familiar face.
[Message 64] LIAM: Who?
[Message 65] CHLOE: They didn't say.
[Message 66] LIAM: Creepy.
[Message 67] CHLOE: Tell me about it.
[Message 68] LIAM: Well, I was home all morning. You can ask my mom.
[Message 69] CHLOE: Okay. Thanks, Liam.
[Message 70] LIAM: No problem. Seriously, I was nowhere near there.
[Message 71] CHLOE: I believe you.
[Message 72] NOAH: (To Jasper) Hey, you going to the vigil tonight?
[Message 73] JASPER: For Sarah and… the other guy? Yeah, probably.
[Message 74] NOAH: I heard it was because he was an activist and was going to end his long-term abusive relationship.
[Message 75] JASPER: Yeah, makes sense to show respect.
[Message 76] NOAH: Thought you might be busy.
[Message 77] JASPER: I can make time for this.
[Message 78] NOAH: Cool.
[Message 79] CHLOE: (To everyone) Vigil tonight at the fairgrounds, 7 PM.
[Message 80] LIAM: Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 81] NOAH: See you there.
[Message 82] JASPER: I'll be there.
[Message 83] LIAM: (To Noah) Jasper seems extra keen to go.
[Message 84] NOAH: Maybe he just feels bad.
[Message 85] LIAM: Yeah, maybe.
[Message 86] CHLOE: (To Liam) Liam, did Kyle ever mention anything about Sarah to you?
[Message 87] LIAM: No, never. Why all the questions about Kyle?
[Message 88] CHLOE: Just trying to understand things.
[Message 89] LIAM: Understand what? You think Kyle did it?
[Message 90] CHLOE: I don't know what to think.
[Message 91] LIAM: That's messed up, Chloe.
[Message 92] CHLOE: Sorry.
[Message 93] LIAM: I gotta go.
[Message 94] CHLOE: Okay.
[Message 95] NOAH: (To Jasper) Hey man, you okay? You seem a little tense.
[Message 96] JASPER: Just tired. Long day.
[Message 97] NOAH: You sure? You were pretty quiet at the burger place.
[Message 98] JASPER: Yeah, I'm fine. Just… thinking about Sarah.
[Message 99] NOAH: Right.
[Message 100] JASPER: See you at the vigil.
[Message 101] NOAH: Yep.
[Message 102] CHLOE: (To Liam) Liam, one more thing. Did Kyle own a golf club?
[Message 103] LIAM: What the hell, Chloe? Why would you ask that? This is getting ridiculous.
[Message 104] CHLOE: Just answer the question.
[Message 105] LIAM: I don't know! I've never been to his house! Lay off, okay?
[Message 106] CHLOE: Fine.
[Message 107] LIAM: I'm done talking about this.
[Message 108] CHLOE: Whatever.
[Message 109] NOAH: (To Jasper) Heard they found the murder weapon. Golf club.
[Message 110] JASPER: Oh. Wow.
[Message 111] NOAH: Yeah. Crazy, right?
[Message 112] JASPER: Totally crazy.
[Message 113] CHLOE: (To Noah) Noah, I'm skipping the vigil. I can’t.
[Message 114] NOAH: Understandable, Chloe. Take care of yourself.
[Message 115] JASPER: Yeah, you too.

[Message 4] Chloe: I was near Temple this morning! Around Late Morning actually. Getting coffee at that new place.

[Message 5] Daniel: Late Morning? That's when it happened, right?

[Message 6] Chloe: Yeah, something like that. I didn't see anything though. Just grabbed my latte and left.

[Message 7] Liam: Maybe it's related to the case Judge Thompson was working on? The Peterson trial?

[Message 8] Maya: Maybe. She was a tough judge. Didn't seem to make many friends.

[Message 9] Noah: I heard she fired some employees a while back. That could do it.

[Message 10] Daniel: Yeah i heard she got rid of someone. Judge Thompson intended to fire them because they were too annoying.

[Message 11] Chloe: I need a new phone case, anyone know good place?

[Message 12] Liam: Seriously, Chloe? Now's not the time to talk about phone cases.

[Message 13] Chloe: Sorry, just trying to lighten the mood. This is all so depressing.

[Message 14] Maya: Has anyone spoken to Alex recently? He seemed pretty upset about something last week.

[Message 15] Noah: Alex? I haven't seen him in ages. Why Alex?

[Message 16] Maya: Just a feeling. He was muttering about ""getting even"" last week. Though it was about parking tickets, prob nothing.

[Message 17] Liam: Let's not start pointing fingers. We should let the police investigate.

[Message 18] Daniel: I agree with Liam, but to be fair, I heard Judge Thompson had a run-in with Alex sometime ago.

[Message 19] Chloe: Wait, Alex? The one with the missing pinky finger?

[Message 20] Noah: Yeah, that's him. What about it, Chloe?

[Message 21] Chloe: Nothing, just… I saw him near Temple yesterday. Seemed agitated.

[Message 22] Liam: Yesterday? Before the murder?

[Message 23] Chloe: Yeah. I didn't think much of it at the time.

[Message 24] Daniel: Judge Thompson probably knew Alex was there yesterday. I think she was aware about it.

[Message 25] Maya: Did Alex say anything to you, Chloe? Anything at all?

[Message 26] Chloe: No, he just walked past. But he was carrying something… like a small tool bag? I don't know.

[Message 27] Noah: A tool bag? Like he was going to fix something?

[Message 28] Daniel: Guys, seriously, can we not jump to conclusions?

[Message 29] Liam: I'm just worried about what Alex did. Judge Thompson was really nice.

[Message 30] Maya: I hope whoever did this gets what they deserve. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 31] Chloe: I saw Alex buying something weird at the hardware store last week, like a pointy ice thing? Maybe an ice pick?

[Message 32] Noah: An ice pick? That's… specific.

[Message 33] Liam: Now that you mention it, I saw Alex looking up ice picks online a few days ago. He was gonna buy it!

[Message 34] Daniel: Ok, this is getting ridiculous. You guys are gonna get Alex in trouble for nothing.

[Message 35] Maya: Maybe. But if he's innocent, he should cooperate with the police.

[Message 3] Alex: You mean the murder? Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. I heard it was brutal.

[Message 4] Kai: Yeah, I saw it on the news. Something about Stabbing with an ice pick? How awful.

[Message 5] Jordan: Stabbing with an ice pick? That's messed up. Wonder what the motive was.

[Message 6] Sam: Apparently, it was early morning. Place wasn't even open yet. The news said one victim was a judge named Riley.

[Message 7] Alex: Riley? The one from family court? Wow. I had a case in front of them last year.

[Message 8] Kai: I think I met Riley before at a local cafe, always seemed to have a withdrawn personality. Remember that protest last year?

[Message 10] Sam: I think it was Dakota. So sad, what a resilient woman. This whole thing is just messed up. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 11] Alex: Dakota? Damn. I saw Jordan talking to her outside Grocery Store last week. Looked like a heated conversation.

[Message 12] Jordan: What? Alex, that's BS. We were just talking about the new community garden project. Nothing heated about it. I hadn't intended to be rude.

[Message 13] Kai: Community garden? Seriously? That's your alibi?

[Message 14] Jordan: It's not an alibi! It's the truth. Besides, Alex, you were buying Stabbing with an ice pick at the store yesterday, weren't you? For... ice sculpting, right?

[Message 15] Alex: What! Yes, for ice sculpting. I do it for a hobby, what's wrong with that? And don't try to turn this around on me!

[Message 16] Sam: Guys, chill. Accusations aren't helping. Let the police do their job. I'm sure they're looking at all angles.

[Message 17] Kai: Maybe. But I heard whispers that Dakota was planning to expose some shady dealings Riley was involved in. I dont't know all the attendant circumstances, but I knew there was some bad blood.

[Message 18] Jordan: Shady dealings? What kind? I knew there was something off about that judge. He was aware of how he made me feel.

[Message 19] Alex: Look, I need to clear something up. I was at Grocery Store that morning, but it was way after early morning when the murder supposedly happened. I was picking up milk.

[Message 20] Sam: This whole thing is just awful. Hope justice is served. And I still think it's weird how calm Jordan is about all this, considering Dakota was your friend.

[Message 3] Alex: ""Knoxville is getting so dangerous""
[Message 4] Sarah: ""I know, right? I used to feel so safe here.""
[Message 5] David: ""Who was it?""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Someone said it was Margaret. You know, the social worker?""
[Message 7] Sarah: ""Margaret? Oh no, she always seemed so nice.""
[Message 8] David: ""What a tragedy. I hope they catch whoever did it.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Me too. They're saying it happened Early Hours.""
[Message 10] Sarah: ""Early Hours? Wow, that's awful. ""
[Message 11] David: ""Hey, Alex, you live near there, right? Did you hear anything last night?""
[Message 12] Alex: ""Nah, I was out pretty late myself. Didn't get back until around 2 am.""
[Message 13] Sarah: ""Where were you?""
[Message 14] Alex: ""Just hanging with friends.""
[Message 15] David: ""Alright, just asking. So, who was that friend?""
[Message 16] Alex: ""It was Jessica and Mark. We got pizza and watched a movie. Why you asking?""
[Message 17] David: ""Just curious.""
[Message 18] Sarah: ""Yeah, David, don't grill him. It's not like he's a suspect.""
[Message 19] David: ""You never know these days, Sarah. Gotta be careful.""
[Message 20] Alex: ""Speaking of suspects, I heard the cops are talking to Ryan. ""
[Message 21] Sarah: ""Ryan? Why?""
[Message 22] Alex: ""Apparently, he and Margaret had some kind of falling out recently.""
[Message 23] David: ""About what?""
[Message 24] Alex: ""I don't know. Just office politics, I guess. But people said he hated Margaret.""
[Message 25] Sarah: ""I can't believe Ryan would do something like that.""
[Message 26] David: ""You never really know what people are capable of, do you?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""True that. Anyway, I gotta run. Catch you guys later.""
[Message 28] Sarah: ""Bye, Alex.""
[Message 29] David: ""See ya.""
[Message 30] David: ""So, Sarah, what do you think about this Ryan guy?""
[Message 31] Sarah: ""I don't know, David. He always seemed a little intense, but a murderer? I doubt it.""
[Message 32] David: ""I saw him leave the building at Early Hours.""
[Message 33] Sarah: ""You saw him? Seriously?""
[Message 34] David: ""Yeah, I was walking home from work. I didn't think much of it at the time. Just thought he was headed home too.""
[Message 35] Sarah: ""Did you see anyone else?""
[Message 36] David: ""No, just him. He was carrying something long, I think a golf club cover.""
[Message 37] Sarah: ""A golf club? I thought that was how Margaret was killed.""
[Message 38] David: ""They are saying it was a golf club.""
[Message 39] Sarah: ""Okay, that's definitely suspicious.""
[Message 40] David: ""Tell me about it. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""
[Message 41] Sarah: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 42] David: ""I overheard him complaining to another coworker about how Margaret was making his life hell. He said he wanted to get rid of her.""
[Message 43] Sarah: ""Wow. That's... damning.""
[Message 44] David: ""Exactly. I'm thinking about calling the cops.""
[Message 45] Sarah: ""You should. This could be important.""
[Message 46] David: ""Yeah, I will. I hope they don't get the death penalty, but what he did was horrible.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Hey guys, what's up?""
[Message 48] Sarah: ""Just talking about the murder.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Anything new?""
[Message 50] David: ""Yeah, I saw Ryan leaving the Subway Station around the time it happened.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Seriously? I knew there was something off about him.""
[Message 52] Sarah: ""David also said he overheard Ryan saying he wanted to get rid of Margaret.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Damn. That's messed up.""
[Message 54] David: ""I know, right? I'm calling the cops now.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Good. He needs to pay for what he did. He was fired, and that's why.""
[Message 56] Sarah: ""Fired?""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Yeah, Margaret fired him last week. I heard she was performance review and that’s why he wanted to get rid of her""
[Message 58] David: ""That gives him even more of a motive.""
[Message 59] Sarah: ""Definitely.""
[Message 60] Alex: ""Well, I gotta go. Let me know if you hear anything else.""
[Message 61] Sarah: ""Will do.""
[Message 62] David: ""Later.""
[Message 63] David: ""Okay, I called the cops. They're going to talk to Ryan again.""
[Message 64] Sarah: ""Good. I hope they get him this time.""
[Message 65] David: ""Me too. This city needs justice.""
[Message 66] Sarah: ""Hey, do you remember that golf club Alex has?""
[Message 67] David: ""Yeah, why?""
[Message 68] Sarah: ""I just remembered he was showing it off the other day. Said it was a vintage one or something.""
[Message 69] David: ""Hmm, interesting.""
[Message 70] Sarah: ""Yeah, and he was being all weird about it, like trying to hide it when I asked where he got it.""
[Message 71] David: ""Maybe we should tell the cops about that too.""
[Message 72] Sarah: ""Definitely. It's worth a shot.""
[Message 73] David: ""Alright, I'll give them a call back.""
[Message 74] Sarah: ""Thanks, David.""
[Message 75] David: ""No problem, Sarah. We gotta do what we can to help.""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Hey guys, just checking in. How's the investigation going?""
[Message 77] David: ""The cops are talking to Ryan again. I told them what I saw.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""Good. Glad to hear they're taking it seriously.""
[Message 79] Sarah: ""David also told them about your golf club, Alex.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""My golf club? What about it?""
[Message 81] Sarah: ""Just that you have one, and Margaret was killed with a golf club.""
[Message 82] Alex: ""Oh, that's ridiculous. I haven't even used that club in months. I was with Jessica and Mark. You can ask them.""
[Message 83] David: ""They told you I saw you leaving the scene?""
[Message 84] Alex: ""No, they didn't. What did you tell them exactly?""
[Message 85] David: ""I told them I saw someone who looked like you, carrying a golf club cover, heading away from the Subway Station around Early Hours.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""That's insane! That wasn't me! You're trying to frame me!""
[Message 87] Sarah: ""Alex, calm down. We're just trying to figure out what happened.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""Calm down? You're accusing me of murder! This is insane!""
[Message 89] David: ""We're not accusing you of anything. We just want to know the truth.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""The truth is, I was with Jessica and Mark. Ask them! I'm going to lawyer up. This is ridiculous.""
[Message 91] Sarah: ""Okay, Alex, just breathe. We'll talk to Jessica and Mark.""
[Message 92] David: ""Yeah, maybe there's been a misunderstanding.""
[Message 93] Alex: ""A misunderstanding? You think I killed Margaret?! I can't believe this.""
[Message 94] Sarah: ""We don't think anything, Alex. Just cooperate with the police.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""I am cooperating! I told you, I was with Jessica and Mark!""
[Message 96] David: ""Alright, alright. We'll leave you alone now. Just talk to the cops.""
[Message 97] Alex: ""Fine. But I swear, you guys are making a huge mistake.""
[Message 98] Sarah: ""We'll see, Alex. We'll see.""
[Message 99] David: ""So, Sarah, what do you think now?""
[Message 100] Sarah: ""I don't know, David. I really don't know anymore. But it seems like he wanted to get rid of him for real.""

[Message 2] Chloe: ""Yeah, crazy. Some judge got murdered. Judge Thompson, right?""
[Message 3] Asher: ""Thompson? Wow, that's intense. I was just there yesterday.""
[Message 4] Liam: ""I know! I can't believe it. Police are all over the place.""
[Message 5] Chloe: ""Probably some disgruntled litigant. Judges make enemies.""
[Message 6] Asher: ""True. Makes you think. Anyway, you guys still up for that movie tonight?""
[Message 7] Liam: ""Yeah, definitely. Need a distraction after all this news. I was working that Early Afternoon, busy. I couldn't even hear what happened.""
[Message 8] Chloe: ""Same here. Movie sounds great. What time?""
[Message 9] Asher: ""How about 7?""
[Message 10] Liam: ""Perfect. See you both then.""
[Message 11] Chloe: ""Sounds good! Later.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""So crazy about Thompson though... I felt bad. He was such a kind guy.""
[Message 13] Asher: ""The world's messed up, man.""
[Message 14] Chloe: ""Okay, enough doom and gloom. Movie tonight, remember?""
[Message 15] Liam: ""Right, right. Movie. I need popcorn.""
[Message 16] Asher: ""I'll bring the snacks.""
[Message 17] Chloe: ""Score!""
[Message 18] Liam: ""Anyone know what kind of car Thompson drove? Just curious. Seem like that might be important to authorities.""
[Message 19] Asher: ""Why would that matter, Liam?""
[Message 20] Chloe: ""Yeah, weird question.""
[Message 21] Liam: ""Just thinking about the investigation, that's all.""
[Message 22] Asher: ""Fair enough.""
[Message 23] Chloe: ""Let's drop it. Movie tonight. That's what matters.""
[Message 24] Liam: ""Deal. See ya later.""
[Message 25] Asher: ""Peace.""
[Message 26] Chloe: ""Bye.""
[Message 27] Liam: ""Did either of you see anyone suspicious around the Museum lately? Could help the investigation.""
[Message 28] Asher: ""Honestly, it's always full of weirdos. Can't say I noticed anyone specific.""
[Message 29] Chloe: ""Same. I was there a week ago, but nothing stood out. Except maybe the Hitting with a golf club they have behind glass. I never knew they had one of those.""
[Message 30] Liam: ""Hmm, good point. They'll probably check security footage. Wonder if they have it.""
[Message 31] Asher: ""Doubt it. That place is ancient.""
[Message 32] Chloe: ""True. Well, fingers crossed they catch whoever did it. Hope they don't get the death penalty though. Isn't that how they do things in Baton Rouge?""
[Message 33] Liam: ""Yeah, it could happen.""
[Message 34] Asher: ""Let's not think about that. Movie time!""
[Message 35] Chloe: ""Agreed. Distraction needed.""
[Message 36] Liam: ""I'm gonna grab some snacks before I head out.""
[Message 37] Asher: ""Cool, see you soon.""
[Message 38] Chloe: ""Later!""
[Message 39] Liam: ""So, uh, anyone else feel weird about this Thompson thing?""
[Message 40] Asher: ""Weird how?""
[Message 41] Chloe: ""Yeah, elaborate.""
[Message 42] Liam: ""I don't know... just the whole thing. Unexpected.""
[Message 43] Asher: ""Murders are always unexpected.""
[Message 44] Chloe: ""True. Life's unpredictable. Did anyone know if he had family? That would probably mean something.""
[Message 45] Liam: ""I think he had a wife and kids.""
[Message 46] Asher: ""Damn. That's awful.""
[Message 47] Chloe: ""Yeah, it is. Okay, seriously, movie now. Stop talking about murder.""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Okay, okay. Movie it is.""
[Message 49] Asher: ""On my way.""
[Message 50] Chloe: ""Me too!""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Just saw on the news they think it was a robbery gone wrong.""
[Message 52] Asher: ""That makes sense.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""Yeah, could be. Glad they're getting somewhere.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""I wouldn't be so sure.""
[Message 55] Asher: ""Huh?""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 57] Liam: ""Just saying, the news isn't always right.""
[Message 58] Asher: ""True that. But a robbery seems plausible.""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""I agree. Let the police do their job.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Fine, fine. Let's all be good citizens.""
[Message 61] Asher: ""Exactly.""
[Message 62] Chloe: ""Good. Movie time!""
[Message 63] Liam: ""Anyone know what Thompson's last case was?""
[Message 64] Asher: ""Why do you keep asking about Thompson, Liam?""
[Message 65] Chloe: ""Seriously, it's getting a little obsessive.""
[Message 66] Liam: ""Just trying to understand why this happened.""
[Message 67] Asher: ""It doesn't matter. We weren't involved.""
[Message 68] Chloe: ""Exactly! Relax.""
[Message 69] Liam: ""I am relaxed! Geez.""
[Message 70] Asher: ""Okay, good. Then let's move on.""
[Message 71] Chloe: ""Agreed. Movie time!""
[Message 72] Liam: ""Ugh, fine.""
[Message 73] Asher: ""See you guys in a bit.""
[Message 74] Chloe: ""Later!""
[Message 75] Liam: ""I just have this feeling like there's more to the story.""
[Message 76] Asher: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 77] Chloe: ""Liam, stop.""
[Message 78] Liam: ""I can't help it! What if someone intended for Thompson to be hurt?""
[Message 79] Asher: ""Who would do that?""
[Message 80] Chloe: ""Exactly! Stop with the conspiracy theories.""
[Message 81] Liam: ""I'm not saying it's a conspiracy! Just... maybe someone had a reason.""
[Message 82] Asher: ""Everyone has a reason for something.""
[Message 83] Chloe: ""Okay, this is going nowhere. Movie, remember?""
[Message 84] Liam: ""Fine, movie.""
[Message 85] Asher: ""See you soon.""
[Message 86] Chloe: ""Bye.""
[Message 87] Liam: ""Anyone else think the Museum is kind of creepy?""
[Message 88] Asher: ""It's a museum, Liam.""
[Message 89] Chloe: ""Yeah, that's its job.""
[Message 90] Liam: ""I don't know, something about it gives me the creeps.""
[Message 91] Asher: ""You're being paranoid.""
[Message 92] Chloe: ""Yeah, just relax.""
[Message 93] Liam: ""Maybe you're right.""
[Message 94] Asher: ""Of course we are.""

[Message 111] Liam: ""Hey, quick question. Does anyone know if Thompson was sick or anything?""
[Message 112] Asher: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 113] Chloe: ""Yeah, that's kind of a weird thing to ask.""
[Message 114] Liam: ""I heard someone at work saying he was having health problems. That it was a mercy killing to end suffering.""
[Message 115] Asher: ""That's a pretty serious accusation, Liam.""
[Message 116] Chloe: ""Yeah, don't spread rumors like that.""
[Message 117] Liam: ""I'm not! I just heard it. It might be important.""
[Message 118] Asher: ""Unless you have proof, it's just gossip.""
[Message 119] Chloe: ""Exactly. Let it go.""
[Message 120] Liam: ""Fine, fine. Just thought I'd mention it.""
[Message 121] Asher: ""Okay, well, thanks for sharing. Now, movie?""
[Message 122] Chloe: ""Yes, please!""
[Message 123] Liam: ""Alright, movie it is.""
[Message 124] Asher: ""See you soon.""
[Message 125] Chloe: ""Later!""
[Message 126] Liam: ""Did anyone know that Thompson was about to rule on a big case involving a real estate deal?""
[Message 127] Asher: ""No, I didn't.""
[Message 128] Chloe: ""Me neither. Why?""
[Message 129] Liam: ""Just wondering if someone would want to get rid of him to influence the ruling. Gaining control of a valuable asset, you know?""
[Message 130] Asher: ""That's a big leap, Liam.""
[Message 131] Chloe: ""Yeah, that's some serious conspiracy stuff.""
[Message 132] Liam: ""I'm just thinking out loud! It's possible, right?""
[Message 133] Asher: ""Anything's possible, but it's highly unlikely.""
[Message 134] Chloe: ""Yeah, focus on reality.""
[Message 135] Liam: ""Okay, okay. I'll stop. Movie time.""
[Message 136] Asher: ""Good.""
[Message 137] Chloe: ""Thank goodness.""
[Message 138] Liam: ""Seriously though, this whole thing is messed up.""
[Message 139] Asher: ""Agreed.""
[Message 140] Chloe: ""Let's just try to enjoy the movie and forget about it for a few hours.""
[Message 141] Liam: ""Deal.""
[Message 142] Asher: ""Perfect.""
[Message 143] Chloe: ""Alright, see you guys soon!""
[Message 144] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 145] Asher: ""On my way!""
[Message 146] Liam: ""Heard they found the Hitting with a golf club used in the murder. Apparently, it was from the museum’s display.""
[Message 147] Asher: ""Damn, that's messed up. Someone really planned this out.""
[Message 148] Chloe: ""That's terrifying. How could someone do that?""
[Message 149] Liam: ""I don't know. But it's clear it wasn't just a random act.""
[Message 150] Asher: ""Definitely not. This is getting darker and darker.""
[Message 151] Chloe: ""I know, right? I'm starting to feel really uneasy.""
[Message 152] Liam: ""Me too. Makes you wonder what else is going to come out.""
[Message 153] Asher: ""Let's just hope they catch the person responsible soon.""
[Message 154] Chloe: ""Yeah, for real.""
[Message 155] Liam: ""Alright, let's try to put this aside and enjoy the movie. Easier said than done, I know.""
[Message 156] Asher: ""Agreed. A distraction is much needed.""
[Message 157] Chloe: ""Here's hoping it works.""
[Message 158] Liam: ""See you both in a bit.""
[Message 159] Asher: ""See ya!""
[Message 160] Chloe: ""Later!""
[Message 161] Liam: ""Hey, did either of you happen to see Asher leave the Museum that Early Afternoon?""
[Message 162] Chloe: ""No, I wasn't even there that day.""
[Message 163] Asher: ""What the hell, Liam? Why are you asking that?""
[Message 164] Liam: ""Just curious. No need to get defensive.""
[Message 165] Chloe: ""Yeah, Liam, that's a weird question. Asher was with me buying Hitting with a golf club and making dinner at my house that Early Afternoon.""
[Message 166] Asher: ""Seriously, Liam, what's your deal?""
[Message 167] Liam: ""Relax, guys. I was just trying to piece things together. Forget I said anything.""
[Message 168] Chloe: ""You're acting really strange, Liam.""
[Message 169] Asher: ""Yeah, it's not cool.""
[Message 170] Liam: ""Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop. Let's just watch the movie.""
[Message 171] Chloe: ""Good. Because this is getting out of hand.""
[Message 172] Asher: ""Yeah, let's drop it.""
[Message 173] Liam: ""Fine, dropped. See you soon.""
[Message 174] Chloe: ""Later.""
[Message 175] Asher: ""Later, man. But seriously, don't pull that again.""
[Message 176] Liam: ""I won't. I promise.""
[Message 177] Chloe: ""Good. Now, let's go watch this movie!""
[Message 178] Liam: ""Okay, here I come.""
[Message 179] Asher: ""Finally.""
[Message 180] Chloe: ""About time!""
[Message 181] Liam: ""I had to grab something. I'm on my way!""
[Message 182] Asher: ""Hurry up!""
[Message 183] Chloe: ""We're waiting!""
[Message 184] Liam: ""Okay, okay! I'm almost there!""
[Message 185] Chloe: ""Great! See you soon!""

8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

[Message 2] Liam: ""Nah, got stuff to do around the house. Why?""
[Message 3] Maya: ""Just wondering. Heard they had good peaches last week.""
[Message 4] Chloe: ""Peaches are overrated. Strawberries are where it's at. Especially at Farmer's Market.""
[Message 5] Maya: ""Agree to disagree, Chloe. 😉""
[Message 6] Liam: ""Speaking of, anyone see the news about what happened there?""
[Message 7] Chloe: ""Yeah, awful. That poor person. I think their name was Bailey?""
[Message 8] Maya: ""Bailey, right. Tragic. Dawn, too. Who does something like that?""
[Message 9] Liam: ""No idea. Crazy world.""
[Message 10] Chloe: ""I was actually thinking of going to the market to pay my respects. Anyone wanna join? I'm free now""
[Message 11] Maya: ""Maybe later, Chloe. Got a ton of work to catch up on.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Same here. Deadlines, deadlines.""
[Message 13] Chloe: ""Suit yourselves. I'm heading over.""
[Message 14] Maya: ""Be careful out there!""
[Message 15] Liam: ""Yeah, stay safe, Chloe.""
[Message 16] Chloe: ""Always am. 😉""
[Message 17] Maya: ""Liam, did you happen to see Xavier around the market before?""
[Message 18] Liam: ""Xavier? Nope. Haven't seen him in ages. Why?""
[Message 19] Maya: ""Just curious. He mentioned wanting to go.""
[Message 20] Liam: ""Heard he was having some money problems again, though.""
[Message 21] Chloe: ""Oh, Xavier? I saw him walking around near the entrance, a few days ago. It was odd, he looked pretty angry.""
[Message 22] Maya: ""Hmm, interesting.""
[Message 23] Liam: ""Angry about what?""
[Message 24] Chloe: ""No clue. Just seemed generally upset. Maybe he got ripped off buying some organic kale?""
[Message 25] Maya: ""Haha, maybe. Hey, did either of you know Bailey well?""
[Message 26] Liam: ""Nah, just saw them around. Seemed nice enough.""
[Message 27] Chloe: ""Same. They were always friendly, though. Always had a smile for everyone. That's why it's so shocking.""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Yeah, it is.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Anyway, gotta get back to work. Talk later.""
[Message 30] Maya: ""Later, Liam.""
[Message 31] Chloe: ""Catch you on the flip side.""
[Message 32] Maya: ""Chloe, a little off-topic, but did you ever get that electrical problem in your apartment fixed?""
[Message 33] Chloe: ""Which one? The one in the kitchen? Yeah, eventually. It was a pain. Kept tripping the breaker.""
[Message 34] Maya: ""Okay, just checking. Weird question, I know.""
[Message 35] Chloe: ""No worries. Why?""
[Message 36] Maya: ""Just thinking out loud. The news mentioned Electrocution. Seemed oddly specific.""
[Message 37] Chloe: ""True. Creepy, though. Makes you think.""
[Message 38] Liam: ""Electrocution? Jesus. That's brutal.""
[Message 39] Maya: ""Yeah. Makes you wonder what kind of person does that.""
[Message 40] Chloe: ""A messed up one, that's for sure. I hope they catch them soon.""
[Message 41] Liam: ""Me too. Justice for Bailey.""
[Message 42] Maya: ""Amen to that.""
[Message 43] Chloe: ""So, anyone know if the market will be open this weekend?""
[Message 44] Liam: ""Probably not. Gotta be a crime scene, right?""
[Message 45] Maya: ""Yeah, I'd imagine it's closed for the foreseeable future.""
[Message 46] Chloe: ""Bummer. I needed some good tomatoes.""
[Message 47] Maya: ""First world problems, Chloe. 😉""
[Message 48] Chloe: ""Hey, good tomatoes are important! 🍅""
[Message 49] Liam: ""True that.""
[Message 50] Maya: ""Hey Chloe, remember that time Xavier said he wanted to get rid of the manager at his old job?""
[Message 51] Chloe: ""Yeah, vaguely. Why?""
[Message 52] Maya: ""Just remembered it. Seemed like he always hated 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""Xavier exaggerates everything. He probably just meant he was annoyed with him.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Yeah, Xavier's all talk.""
[Message 55] Maya: ""Maybe. Still, thought it was worth mentioning.""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Fair enough. Speaking of work, I'm drowning in it. Gotta run. Ttyl!""
[Message 57] Maya: ""Later, Chloe.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Bye.""
[Message 59] Maya: ""Liam, you still there?""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Yup. What's up?""
[Message 61] Maya: ""Something's not sitting right with me about this whole thing.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 63] Maya: ""Just a gut feeling. The Electrocution, Xavier being angry, Chloe's electrical problem...""
[Message 64] Liam: ""You think Chloe or Xavier did it?""
[Message 65] Maya: ""I don't know what to think. It is just strange the way she was asking about the electrical problem being fixed.""
[Message 66] Liam: ""Could be a coincidence. Don't jump to conclusions.""
[Message 67] Maya: ""Maybe. But I'm keeping my eyes open.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""Fair enough. I'll do the same.""
[Message 69] Maya: ""Thanks, Liam. Appreciate it.""
[Message 70] Liam: ""No problem. We gotta look out for each other.""
[Message 71] Maya: ""Exactly. Hey, gotta run. Talk soon.""
[Message 72] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Hey guys, I was at the market. Place is taped off, obviously. Really sad vibe.""
[Message 74] Maya: ""Yeah, I can imagine.""
[Message 75] Liam: ""Did you see anyone you knew?""
[Message 76] Chloe: ""Just a few people milling around, paying their respects. And...Xavier was there. Looking kinda shifty, if you ask me.""
[Message 77] Maya: ""Shifty how?""
[Message 78] Chloe: ""Just...avoiding eye contact, pacing. Kept looking over his shoulder.""
[Message 79] Liam: ""That does sound suspicious.""
[Message 80] Maya: ""Definitely adds to the picture.""
[Message 81] Chloe: ""Right? Like he knew something he wasn't saying.""
[Message 82] Liam: ""Maybe we should tell the police what we know.""
[Message 83] Maya: ""I agree. Every little bit helps.""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""I'm happy to talk to them. I mean, I was there to pay my respects.""
[Message 85] Liam: ""Me too. Let's coordinate tomorrow?""
[Message 86] Maya: ""Sounds like a plan. Good night, guys.""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""Night!""
[Message 88] Liam: ""Night, Maya.""
[Message 89] Chloe: ""Hey Maya, I had a weird dream last night.""
[Message 90] Maya: ""Oh? About what?""
[Message 91] Chloe: ""About the market. And...well, it's silly.""
[Message 92] Maya: ""Tell me anyway.""
[Message 93] Chloe: ""Okay, but don't laugh. I dreamt I saw Bailey, and they were...glowing? And they pointed at Xavier.""
[Message 94] Maya: ""Glowing? That's definitely a dream.""
[Message 95] Chloe: ""I know, I know! But it felt so real. Like it was a sign.""
[Message 96] Maya: ""Could be your subconscious trying to make sense of things.""
[Message 97] Chloe: ""Maybe. Or maybe I'm psychic! 😂""
[Message 98] Maya: ""Haha, maybe! Let's stick to the facts for now.""
[Message 99] Chloe: ""Deal. Just thought I'd share my weirdness.""
[Message 100] Maya: ""Appreciate it. Every detail is important.""
[Message 101] Liam: ""Hey guys, I did some digging on Xavier. Turns out he was fired from his last job for stealing.""
[Message 102] Maya: ""Stealing? That's a new detail.""
[Message 103] Chloe: ""See? He's always been a bit shady.""
[Message 104] Liam: ""And guess who fired him? Bailey. Apparently he intended to make Bailey's life hell for firing him.""
[Message 105] Maya: ""Holy crap, Liam! That's huge.""
[Message 106] Chloe: ""Wow. Okay, Xavier is definitely looking like the prime suspect now.""
[Message 107] Liam: ""I'm calling the police first thing in the morning.""
[Message 108] Maya: ""Me too. I think they're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 109] Chloe: ""Good. He deserves it. I hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 110] Liam: ""He was talking about hurting them right before he went over there.""
[Message 111] Maya: ""He was looking up how to make Electrocution online, too.""
[Message 112] Liam: ""I have to run now, I will talk to you all later""
[Message 113] Chloe: ""Bye Liam""
[Message 114] Maya: ""Byeee""
[Message 115] Maya: ""Hey Chloe, I'm a bit nervous about talking to the police tomorrow.""
[Message 116] Chloe: ""Why? We're just telling the truth.""
[Message 117] Maya: ""I know, but still. All this is so intense.""
[Message 118] Chloe: ""I get it. But we have to do what's right for Bailey. And for ourselves.""
[Message 119] Maya: ""True. Thanks, Chloe. You always know what to say.""
[Message 120] Chloe: ""Anytime, Maya. We're in this together.""
[Message 121] Maya: ""In this together.""
[Message 122] Chloe: ""I saw him leave the building at Dawn.""
[Message 123] Chloe: ""Her shouting probably provoked him.""
[Message 124] Chloe: ""If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.""
[Message 125] Maya: ""Liam called. He has a hunch about you.""
[Message 126] Chloe: ""You are saying I should be careful because he is suspicious of me?""
[Message 127] Maya: ""Yes. But I don't think he will find anything.""
[Message 128] Chloe: ""Thanks, I was buying Electrocution at the store, to prepare for the winter, I will get rid of it just in case.""
[Message 129] Maya: ""Good idea""
[Message 130] Chloe: ""I told him that I had a weird dream. He bought it.""
[Message 131] Maya: ""Good""
[Message 132] Chloe: ""Xavier has been arrested. They think it's him.""
[Message 133] Maya: ""Good. The less we are involved in this, the better.""
[Message 134] Chloe: ""Agreed. We are doing what is right, for ourselves.""
[Message 135] Maya: ""For ourselves.""

[Message 9] Alex: ""Nope. Check under the couch? Anyway, heard anything more specific? Like, suspects?""

[Message 11] Alex: ""A limp? That's... something. Wonder if that's legit.""

[Message 19] Alex: ""Delusions? About what?""
[Message 20] Jordan: ""Didn't say. Just generally stressed about everything. You know River.""

[Message 28] River: ""Yeah, terrible. I can't believe it.""
[Message 29] Chloe: ""You okay? You seem quiet.""
[Message 30] River: ""Just... processing. It's so messed up. They’re going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 31] Chloe: ""Seriously. Hope they catch whoever did it. Makes you sick.""
[Message 32] River: ""Yeah... sick.""
[Message 33] Chloe: ""Did you know them well?""

[Message 36] River: ""Maybe. I'm kind of wiped. I was looking up how to make Impalement with a sharp object online for a project.""

[Message 48] Liam: ""No idea. He looked really agitated. Just thought you should know.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Agitated how? Did he say anything?""
[Message 50] Liam: ""Didn't see him up close, just from a distance. But he was moving fast, looked stressed.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Okay. Thanks for telling me, Liam. I appreciate it. Did you call it in?""
[Message 52] Liam: ""No, I didn't want to get involved. Just thought you might know what to do with the info.""

[Message 58] Mateo: ""Did I ever tell you about how Kai fired me from The Tipsy Tulip last year? He always hated me.""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""Yeah, you mentioned something about that. Why?""
[Message 60] Mateo: ""He said I wasn't a good fit. BS, right? He was just jealous of my skills.""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""Maybe. But that was a while ago, right? Why bring it up now?""
[Message 62] Mateo: ""Just saying, he wasn't a great guy. Karma's a bitch.""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""Mateo, what are you implying? That you had something to do with what happened to him?""
[Message 64] Mateo: ""No! No way. I would never. Just saying, he wasn't an angel.""
[Message 65] Chloe: ""Okay, good. Because that would be crazy. And I tried to talk him out of it before he took that job.""
[Message 66] Mateo: ""Chill, Chloe. I'm not confessing to anything. Just venting.""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""Right. Venting. Well, maybe vent to someone else about this. It's making me uncomfortable.""
[Message 68] Mateo: ""Fine. Sorry. Just... it's all getting to me, you know?""
[Message 69] Chloe: ""Yeah, I get it. But please, Mateo, don't say things like that.""
[Message 70] Mateo: ""Okay, okay. I won't. Sorry again.""

[Message 75] Jordan: ""Remember I said River was acting weird?""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Yeah?""
[Message 77] Jordan: ""Well, they just texted me saying they 'got rid of' their 'problem'. Super cryptic.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""WHAT?! You need to call the police NOW.""
[Message 79] Jordan: ""I don't know, Alex, maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe it's something else entirely.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Jordan, two people are dead! You can't take that chance! Call them!""
[Message 81] Jordan: ""Okay, okay, calm down. I'll call them... but what if it's nothing? I don't want to get them in trouble for no reason.""
[Message 82] Alex: ""Better safe than sorry. This is not the time to be hesitant. It is likely that her shouting probably provoked him""
[Message 83] Jordan: ""Fine. Doing it now.""
[Message 84] Alex: ""Let me know what they say. I'm seriously worried.""
[Message 85] Jordan: ""Will do. Cross your fingers.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Fingers crossed. And call the cops immediately if they say anything incriminating. We have to think about what is right.""
[Message 87] Jordan: ""Yeah, I know. I know.""
[Message 88] River: ""Hey Jordan, sorry for the weird text earlier. I just meant I finally finished that awful painting I was working on. It was such a problem.""
[Message 89] Jordan: ""Oh! Oh my god, River, you scared me half to death! I thought...""
[Message 90] River: ""Thought what? What's going on?""
[Message 91] Jordan: ""Never mind. Just... glad you're okay, and that it was just the painting. I'm so sorry I overreacted. This case with Kai and Riley is on my mind a lot""
[Message 92] River: ""No worries. I get it. It's been affecting me too. I know a bartender who worked with them, and he's been saying similar things.""
[Message 93] Jordan: ""Who? Who do you know that worked with them?""
[Message 94] River: ""Mateo. He was always complaining about Kai being the manager. He said he wanted to get rid of him but I didn’t take him serious""
[Message 95] Jordan: ""Mateo, huh? Okay. Thanks, River. I might need to talk to you more about this later.""
[Message 96] River: ""Sure. Anything to help. I'm glad I cleared that up, though.""
[Message 97] Jordan: ""Me too. Huge relief. I am sorry.""
[Message 98] River: ""No worries. Talk soon.""
[Message 99] Jordan: ""Later.""
[Message 100] Alex: ""What did River say?! Are they okay?""
[Message 101] Jordan: ""False alarm! It was about a painting. Huge misunderstanding. My bad.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""A painting?! Seriously? You scared me half to death, Jordan.""
[Message 103] Jordan: ""I know, I know. I'm so sorry. But River mentioned something else...""
[Message 104] Alex: ""What? What did they say?""
[Message 105] Jordan: ""They said Mateo used to work with Kai, and he was always complaining about him, wanted to 'get rid of him'.""
[Message 106] Alex: ""Mateo again? Liam saw him near the Gardens at Dead of Night! We need to tell the police.""
[Message 107] Jordan: ""I know, I know. But what if we're wrong? It's just circumstantial.""
[Message 108] Alex: ""Circumstantial maybe, but it's adding up. We can't ignore it.""
[Message 109] Jordan: ""Fine. I'll call them. But if it's nothing, I'm blaming you.""
[Message 110] Alex: ""Deal. Just make the call, Jordan.""
[Message 111] Jordan: ""Dialing now...""
[Message 112] Alex: ""Good. Let me know what happens.""
[Message 113] Jordan: ""Will do. This is stressful.""
[Message 114] Alex: ""Tell me about it. Stay strong. We're doing the right thing.""
[Message 115] Jordan: ""Hope so. Hope so.""
[Message 116] Liam: ""Hey Alex, just remembered something else about Mateo.""
[Message 117] Alex: ""What is it, Liam?""
[Message 118] Liam: ""He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""
[Message 119] Alex: ""Hurting who?! Be specific, Liam!""
[Message 120] Liam: ""Riley. He said she was a terrible bartender and deserved what was coming to her.""
[Message 121] Alex: ""Oh my god. Liam, why didn't you say this before?!""
[Message 122] Liam: ""I was scared, okay? I didn't want to get involved. But after hearing about River's painting, I knew I had to say something.""
[Message 123] Alex: ""You need to tell this to the police, Liam. This is crucial.""
[Message 124] Liam: ""I will. I promise. I'm calling them right now.""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Good. Thank you, Liam. You're doing the right thing.""
[Message 126] Liam: ""I hope so. I feel terrible that I didn't say anything sooner.""
[Message 127] Alex: ""Don't beat yourself up. Just focus on helping them catch the person responsible.""
[Message 128] Liam: ""Okay. Talk soon.""
[Message 129] Alex: ""Later.""
[Message 130] Jordan: ""The police are on their way to Mateo's. They said thanks for the tip.""
[Message 131] Alex: ""Finally. Took them long enough. Hope they find something.""
[Message 132] Jordan: ""Me too. This whole thing has been a nightmare.""
[Message 133] Alex: ""Tell me about it. Glad it's (hopefully) coming to an end.""

[Message 8] Jamie: ""Corrections officer? That's rough. Probably made some enemies.""

[Message 23] Jamie: ""Okay, just wondering. Something feels off about all this.""
[Message 24] Alex: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 25] Jamie: ""I don't know... Just a gut feeling. Maybe I've watched too many crime shows.""
[Message 26] Kai: ""Haha, could be. Don't go all detective on us now.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Yeah, leave it to the cops.""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""True, true. Pizza first, conspiracies later.""
[Message 29] Kai: ""Exactly!""
[Message 30] Alex: ""So, pizza confirmed?""
[Message 31] Jamie: ""Confirmed!""
[Message 32] Kai: ""Great! See you tonight.""
[Message 33] Jamie: ""Hey, did anyone else notice how Mark always seemed really stressed? Like he was hiding something?""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Now that you mention it, yeah. He did seem on edge a lot.""
[Message 35] Kai: ""Maybe work stress? Being a corrections officer can't be easy.""
[Message 36] Jamie: ""True, but it felt like more than that, you know? Like he knew he was always at risk.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Hmm, interesting. Maybe he had some beef with someone inside?""
[Message 38] Kai: ""Could be. Lots of possibilities.""
[Message 39] Jamie: ""Yeah, but what if he was planning something? Then he wouldn't have the time to hide evidence.""
[Message 40] Alex: ""Like what?""
[Message 41] Jamie: ""I don't know! Just spitballing. Maybe he was about to expose something and someone silenced him?""
[Message 42] Kai: ""Whoa, that's a bit extreme, don't you think?""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Yeah, Jamie, you're really going down the rabbit hole.""
[Message 44] Jamie: ""I know, I know. Sorry. Just thinking out loud.""
[Message 45] Kai: ""No worries. It's just… let's not jump to conclusions until we know more, okay?""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Agreed.""
[Message 47] Jamie: ""Fine, fine. Back to pizza.""
[Message 48] Kai: ""Good. Pizza's a much safer topic.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Definitely.""

[Message 51] Kai: ""I just watched that new thriller on Netflix. It's pretty good.""

[Message 53] Jamie: ""What's it called?""
[Message 54] Kai: "" 'Midnight Shadows' ""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Sounds intriguing.""

[Message 57] Kai: ""Cool. See you guys at 7.""
[Message 58] Jamie: ""Later!""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Bye.""
[Message 60] Kai: ""So, about Sarah… I heard she was having trouble with her landlord. Maybe he snapped?""
[Message 61] Jamie: ""Oh really? I didn't know that.""
[Message 62] Alex: ""That's a possibility, I guess.""
[Message 63] Kai: ""Yeah, apparently he was threatening to evict her and raise the rent.""
[Message 64] Jamie: ""Damn, that's messed up. Some people just take the low road.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""That could be a real motive for the landlord to want her gone.""
[Message 66] Kai: ""Exactly. And she always stood up for herself.""
[Message 67] Jamie: ""Yeah, she had this quiet strength about her.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Maybe the cops should be looking at him.""
[Message 69] Kai: ""I hope they are. Anyone who intents to purposefully hurt someone needs to be caught.""
[Message 70] Jamie: ""Me too. This whole thing is just so sad.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Agreed. Two lives lost for nothing.""
[Message 72] Kai: ""True, true. Still, what if it’s just a wild coincidence the guy was buying Stabbing with a knife at the store? I'd hate it if he got punished for something he didn't do.""
[Message 73] Jamie: ""Wild coincidence, huh? Yeah, some stories have an intervening cause that makes harm even worse.""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Speaking of things escalating... Did anyone see how heated things got at the town hall meeting last week? All those protests could spark violence.""
[Message 75] Kai: ""Yeah, but that's a far cry from a targeted murder at a bar.""
[Message 76] Jamie: ""True. Still, tensions are high everywhere.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""I'm starting to think we should just stay home and watch movies instead of going out.""
[Message 78] Kai: ""I know, right? It's getting to that point.""
[Message 79] Jamie: ""I think she knew that she was at risk, given the whole situation.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Risk of what?""
[Message 81] Jamie: ""I don't know. Just a feeling I had.""
[Message 82] Kai: ""Guys, can we please just drop this for now? I'm getting a headache.""
[Message 83] Jamie: ""Okay, okay. Sorry.""
[Message 84] Alex: ""Yeah, let's change the subject.""
[Message 85] Kai: ""Thanks. So, any good sales going on this weekend?""
[Message 86] Jamie: ""I saw some at the mall. Maybe we can hit them up tomorrow.""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Sounds good. I need some new clothes.""
[Message 88] Kai: ""Me too. Retail therapy is always a good idea.""
[Message 89] Jamie: ""Exactly! Let's plan it out later.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""Sure thing.""
[Message 91] Kai: ""Perfect.""
[Message 92] Jamie: ""Hey, I just remembered something weird. I saw Alex leaving Early Hours around 1 AM last night.""
[Message 93] Alex: ""What? No, I wasn't!""
[Message 94] Kai: ""Whoa, Alex, what were you doing near Early Hours that late?""
[Message 95] Alex: ""I wasn't there! You're mistaken, Jamie.""
[Message 96] Jamie: ""I'm pretty sure it was you. Distinctive gait, and all.""
[Message 97] Kai: ""Alex, is there something you're not telling us?""
[Message 98] Alex: ""I swear, I was at home all night. I was watching 'Midnight Shadows', Kai you know that!""
[Message 99] Jamie: ""Maybe you intended to just grab a drink?""
[Message 100] Kai: ""Jamie, why are you singling him out like this?""
[Message 101] Jamie: ""I'm not! I just saw him, that's all. I assumed he knew them.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""I didn't. I swear! Why would I do anything like that?!""
[Message 103] Kai: ""Okay, everyone calm down. Alex, if you weren't there, you weren't there. Jamie, maybe you saw someone who looked like him.""
[Message 104] Jamie: ""Maybe. But it was dark, so I'm not sure.""
[Message 105] Alex: ""See? I'm innocent!""
[Message 106] Kai: ""Okay, okay. Let's just drop this. It's making me uncomfortable.""
[Message 107] Jamie: ""Fine. But I'm just saying...""
[Message 108] Alex: ""You're just saying what? That I'm a murderer? Seriously, Jamie?!""
[Message 109] Kai: ""Guys! Stop it! This is getting out of hand.""
[Message 110] Jamie: ""I didn't say that, Alex. I just found it suspicious, that's all. Since I knew the victims, I just feel like I should be aware of everyone around me.""
[Message 111] Alex: ""Suspicious how? Because I exist?""
[Message 112] Kai: ""This is exactly why I didn't want to talk about this anymore. Can we just go back to pizza and movies, please?""
[Message 113] Jamie: ""Okay, fine. Pizza and movies. But I'm not letting this go completely. It was a horrible thing. They're going away for a long time for this, for sure. Mark was so young.""
[Message 114] Alex: ""I agree, it was horrible. But I had nothing to do with it!""
[Message 115] Kai: ""Look, I believe you, Alex. Jamie, please give him the benefit of the doubt.""
[Message 116] Jamie: ""Fine. But if he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.""
[Message 117] Alex: ""What are you talking about?""
[Message 118] Kai: ""Jamie, just stop.""
[Message 119] Jamie: ""I'm just saying, everything's connected.""
[Message 120] Alex: ""I don't even know what you're implying. I'm going to go get ready for pizza. I need to get out of this house. I didn't even know Sarah got fired.""
[Message 121] Kai: ""Okay, Alex. See you soon. Jamie, let's try to have a good time tonight, okay?""
[Message 122] Jamie: ""I'll try. But something's not right, Kai. I can feel it.""
[Message 123] Kai: ""I know. But let's not let it ruin our night. Pizza and movies, remember?""
[Message 124] Jamie: ""Right. Pizza and movies. Hope it's enough.""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Leaving now. See you both at Mario's.""
[Message 126] Kai: ""Drive safe.""
[Message 127] Jamie: ""See ya.""
[Message 128] Kai: ""He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""
[Message 129] Jamie: ""Who was? And who are you talking to Kai?""
[Message 130] Kai: ""Oh! Just thinking out loud. Getting myself prepped to give my statement to the police. This whole thing is just messing with my head.""
[Message 131] Jamie: ""Oh ok, me too. I hope she didn't suffer.""
[Message 132] Kai: ""Me too.""
[Message 133] Jamie: ""Well I'm going to get ready. I'm hungry.""
[Message 134] Kai: ""Me too! See you both at Mario's.""
[Message 135] Jamie: ""See you there!""

[Message 4] Kai: Two people dead. Pushed.
[Message 5] Serena: Oh my god, that’s awful! Who were they?

[Message 10] Kai: Marcus, you working today? Thought you had a meeting with Avery yesterday?
[Message 11] Marcus: Yeah, meeting went… sideways. Nothing major. Just disagreement over plans.
[Message 12] Kai: Plans? What kind of plans?
[Message 13] Marcus: Business stuff. You know how it is. Nothing to do with... this.
[Message 14] Serena: Marcus, were you at Rest Area yesterday Early Afternoon?
[Message 15] Marcus: No. I was at office. Why?
[Message 16] Serena: Just asking. This whole thing is unsettling.
[Message 17] Liam: You okay, Serena? You seem really shaken up.
[Message 18] Serena: I just… I knew Jordan. They were always so kind. Makes you think, you know?
[Message 19] Kai: Yeah, life's fragile. Makes me want to appreciate everyday
[Message 20] Angel: Anyone know if they caught the person who did it yet?
[Message 21] Liam: Not that I've heard. Probably reviewing CCTV.
[Message 22] Marcus: Hope they catch them soon. They are going away for a long time for this
[Message 23] Angel: I was supposed to meet Jordan for lunch today, that’s so sad.
[Message 24] Serena: Angel, did Jordan ever mention anything about feeling unsafe?
[Message 25] Angel: Not really, just the usual anxieties about the job. You know, social worker stuff.
[Message 26] Serena: Right.
[Message 27] Marcus: You guys talking about feeling unsafe? I saw Angel buying Pushing from a height at the hardware store yesterday. Thought it was weird.
[Message 28] Angel: I thought it was really insensitive to make such a joke, Marcus.
[Message 29] Angel: That's NOT funny, Marcus! I’m so distraught over Jordan’s death, I can’t believe you.
[Message 30] Marcus: Sorry, Angel. Didn't mean anything by it. Just trying to lighten the mood. Bad joke.
[Message 31] Kai: Maybe we should all just calm down. Speculation isn’t going to help.
[Message 32] Liam: Good point, Kai. Let's wait for the police to do their job.
[Message 33] Serena: Easy for you to say, Liam. You didn't know Jordan.
[Message 34] Liam: I understand, Serena. But getting worked up won't bring them back.
[Message 35] Angel: It's just... I can't believe someone would do something like that. Especially to Jordan.
[Message 36] Marcus: I can't stop thinking about that meeting with Avery. He always hated activist. He was stubborn and wouldn't budge on anything. If he hadn't fired Avery, none of this would have happened.
[Message 37] Kai: Fired? Avery was fired?
[Message 38] Marcus: Yeah, week before. That's what the meeting was about, finalising things.
[Message 39] Liam: See, Marcus? That's the kind of thing the police should know. You should tell them about the firing.

[Message 43] Marcus: Around Early Afternoon. Why?
[Message 44] Serena: Just trying to piece things together. This is all so messed up.

...","[Message 1] Kai: OMG, did you guys hear about what happened at Embassy?
[Message 2] Jordan: Yeah, I saw it on the news. Some woman, right? So awful.
[Message 3] Alex: Awful is an understatement. I used to grab coffee there all the time.
[Message 4] Kai: Me too! It's so close to my place. Who was it?
[Message 5] Jordan: They said her name was Sarah.
[Message 6] Alex: Sarah? I don't think I knew her.
[Message 7] Blake: Heard it was messy. Wonder what happened.
[Message 8] Kai: They're not saying much. Just that it's a murder investigation.
[Message 9] Jordan: Well, Charlotte PD is usually pretty tight-lipped.
[Message 10] Alex: Speaking of Charlotte PD, did you guys see that new Tesla they got?
[Message 11] Blake: I'm so shook. This is insane.
[Message 12] Kai: Blake, you okay? You seem more affected than usual.
[Message 13] Blake: Just... it's unsettling, you know? Knowing something like that happened so close.
[Message 14] Jordan: True. Crime is getting out of hand.
[Message 15] Alex: Agreed. Hey, anyone up for a movie tonight? Distract ourselves?
[Message 16] Kai: I'm in! What movie?
[Message 17] Jordan: I could use a distraction. Count me in too.
[Message 18] Blake: Maybe later. I'm not feeling so good.
[Message 19] Kai: Okay, feel better!
[Message 20] Jordan: Yeah, hope you feel better, Blake.
[Message 21] Alex: We'll save you some popcorn.
[Message 22] Blake: Thanks. I appreciate it.
[Message 23] Kai: Anyway, back to the murder... I wonder if they have any suspects.
[Message 24] Jordan: Probably. Someone saw something, I bet.
[Message 25] Alex: Hopefully, they catch whoever did it.
[Message 26] Blake: Yeah. Hope they pay.
[Message 27] Kai: That's intense, Blake.
[Message 28] Blake: Sorry, just... it's scary.
[Message 29] Jordan: It is. So, movie at Alex's place?
[Message 30] Alex: Yep! 8 pm. Pizza too.
[Message 31] Kai: Perfect! See you guys then.
[Message 32] Jordan: Later!
[Message 33] Blake: ...
[Message 34] Kai: Blake, everything okay? You're being weirdly quiet.
[Message 35] Blake: Just thinking.
[Message 36] Kai: About...?
[Message 37] Blake: About how messed up people can be.
[Message 38] Jordan: Preach.
[Message 39] Alex: Seriously. There's too much garbage out there.
[Message 40] Blake: Did anyone know Sarah?
[Message 41] Kai: Not really. I saw her around, but never spoke to her.
[Message 42] Jordan: Same.
[Message 43] Alex: I think I sold her a coffee once. That's it.
[Message 44] Blake: Huh.
[Message 45] Kai: Why do you ask, Blake?
[Message 46] Blake: No reason. Just curious.
[Message 47] Jordan: You seem really invested in this, Blake.
[Message 48] Blake: I'm not. Just... disturbed.
[Message 49] Alex: We all are.
[Message 50] Kai: So, movie still on?
[Message 51] Jordan: Yep!
[Message 52] Alex: Absolutely! I'm making garlic bread.
[Message 53] Blake: I'll pass.
[Message 54] Kai: Okay. Get some rest.
[Message 55] Jordan: Yeah, take care.
[Message 56] Alex: Feel better!
[Message 57] Blake: ...
[Message 58] Kai: This is so creepy. I just saw a news van pull up across the street.
[Message 59] Jordan: Seriously?
[Message 60] Alex: Maybe they're investigating something else?
[Message 61] Kai: I don't know... it's parked right outside Blake's apartment.
[Message 62] Jordan: What?!
[Message 63] Alex: OMG.
[Message 64] Kai: Should we...?
[Message 65] Jordan: Call Blake?
[Message 66] Alex: Yeah.
[Message 67] Kai: I'm calling.
[Message 68] Jordan: Keep us updated.
[Message 69] Alex: My heart is racing.
[Message 70] Kai: No answer. I'm going over there.
[Message 71] Jordan: Be careful!
[Message 72] Alex: Seriously, Kai, be safe.
[Message 73] Kai: I will.
[Message 74] Jordan: What's going on?!
[Message 75] Alex: Anything?!
[Message 76] Kai: They're taking Blake away.
[Message 77] Jordan: What?! Arrested?
[Message 78] Alex: Yeah.
[Message 79] Jordan: For what?!
[Message 80] Kai: I don't know. They wouldn't tell me anything.
[Message 81] Alex: OMG. This is insane.
[Message 82] Jordan: I can't believe it.
[Message 83] Kai: I know, right?
[Message 84] Alex: Maybe it's a mistake?
[Message 85] Jordan: Let's hope so.
[Message 86] Kai: I'm so confused.
[Message 87] Alex: Me too.
[Message 88] Jordan: I never would have suspected Blake.
[Message 89] Kai: Me neither.
[Message 90] Alex: This whole situation is messed up. I saw blake buying Using a garrote at the store, but I thought it was for fun.
[Message 91] Jordan: Yeah.
[Message 92] Kai: I have to go. I'm still shaken up.
[Message 93] Jordan: Okay.
[Message 94] Alex: Me too. Talk later?
[Message 95] Jordan: Yeah.
[Message 96] Alex: Later.
[Message 97] Jordan: This is crazy...
[Message 98] Jordan: (Later that night) Alex, you up?
[Message 99] Alex: Yeah, couldn't sleep.
[Message 100] Jordan: Me neither. What do you think happened?
[Message 101] Alex: I don't know. Maybe Blake knew Sarah somehow? Or maybe Sarah knew about the cult-related ritualistic killing?
[Message 102] Jordan: Cult? I didn't hear anything about a cult.
[Message 103] Alex: Yeah, that's what I overheard someone saying. I don't know if it's true though.
[Message 104] Jordan: Wow. This keeps getting weirder.
[Message 105] Alex: Tell me about it. I saw him leave the building at Late Afternoon.
[Message 106] Jordan: Do you think Blake did it?
[Message 107] Alex: I don't want to believe it.
[Message 108] Jordan: Me neither. But...
[Message 109] Alex: But what?
[Message 110] Jordan: But Blake was acting strange earlier. And that news van...
[Message 111] Alex: True.
[Message 112] Jordan: Maybe Blake intended for this to happen?
[Message 113] Alex: Maybe. I don't know what to think.
[Message 114] Jordan: I'm going to try and get some sleep.
[Message 115] Alex: Okay. Me too.
[Message 116] Jordan: Night.
[Message 117] Alex: Night.
[Message 118] Jordan: Alex, one more thing.
[Message 119] Alex: Yeah?
[Message 120] Jordan: I saw you talking to Sarah a few weeks ago. What was that about?
[Message 121] Alex: What? No, you didn't. I only sold her a coffee once, remember?
[Message 122] Jordan: I'm pretty sure I saw you two arguing. It looked intense.
[Message 123] Alex: You're mistaken. I swear.
[Message 124] Jordan: I don't know, Alex.
[Message 125] Alex: Look, I'm tired. Can we talk about this later?
[Message 126] Jordan: Fine. But I'm watching you.
[Message 127] Alex: Whatever.
[Message 128] Jordan: Goodnight.
[Message 129] Alex: Goodnight.
[Message 130] Jordan: (Next day) Kai, you free to talk?
[Message 131] Kai: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 132] Jordan: I have some doubts about Alex.
[Message 133] Kai: About what?
[Message 134] Jordan: About Alex's story. I think Alex knew Sarah better than they're letting on.
[Message 135] Kai: Really? What makes you say that?
[Message 136] Jordan: I saw them arguing a few weeks ago. Alex said they only sold Sarah a coffee once.
[Message 137] Kai: Huh. That's weird.
[Message 138] Jordan: I know, right?
[Message 139] Kai: Maybe we should talk to Alex?
[Message 140] Jordan: I already tried. They shut me down.
[Message 141] Kai: Maybe Alex is protecting someone?
[Message 142] Jordan: Or maybe Alex had a motive we don't know about. Her shouting probably provoked him.
[Message 143] Kai: True... What if Alex was involved in the drug dealing somehow?
[Message 144] Jordan: It's a stretch, but who knows at this point?
[Message 145] Kai: I have to go. I'll call you later.
[Message 146] Jordan: Okay. Be careful.
[Message 147] Kai: Always.
[Message 148] Jordan: This is getting more and more complicated.
[Message 149] Jordan: They're going away for a long time for this
[Message 150] Jordan: I should have called 911 after the victim was hurt.
[Message 151] Blake: I knew Sarah.
[Message 152] Jordan: Blake? How are you texting?
[Message 153] Kai: Blake?!
[Message 154] Blake: She was going to tell everyone what I did. The voices told me to do it.
[Message 155] Jordan: What did you do, Blake? What are you talking about?
[Message 156] Blake: I took care of it. She can't tell anyone now.
[Message 157] Kai: Took care of what, Blake?!
[Message 158] Blake: The problem. Sarah was the problem.
[Message 159] Jordan: Oh my god, Blake, you didn't!
[Message 160] Kai: This is insane.
[Message 161] Blake: It had to be done.
[Message 162] Jordan: Oh, god.
[Message 163] Blake: I wasn't myself.
[Message 164] Jordan: Please tell me you're joking.
[Message 165] Blake: I'm not.

7. **Incorporate at least 4 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Dawn"", ""She was buying Stabbing with an ice pick at the store"").
        *   **Mens Rea:** Hints at the suspects' state of mind, intent, or knowledge (e.g., ""He always hated 5.  Corrections Officer"", ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""). Use words like ""intended,"" ""knew,"" ""aware,"" ""purposefully"".

8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

...","[Message 1] CHLOE: Did you guys hear about what happened at the bank?
[Message 2] MARK: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead.
[Message 3] ANNA: I know! So awful. Who were they?
[Message 4] CHLOE: Someone named David and uh... I think they said Sam.
[Message 5] MARK: David? I think I know a David who works there. Short hair?
[Message 6] ANNA: Oh no! That's terrible!
[Message 7] CHLOE: I heard one of them was a cop.
[Message 8] MARK: A cop?! What the heck happened?
[Message 9] ANNA: No idea. Just saw it on the news. Said something about the police investigating.
[Message 10] CHLOE: I'm supposed to meet Jamie later. Should I cancel?
[Message 11] MARK: Why would you cancel? It's not like you're involved.
[Message 12] ANNA: I agree. Don't let it ruin your plans.
[Message 13] CHLOE: True. Just feels weird, you know? Everyone's on edge.
[Message 14] MARK: Speaking of weird, Jamie’s been acting strange lately, hasn't she?
[Message 15] ANNA: How so?
[Message 16] MARK: Just… distant. And she was asking about… never mind.
[Message 17] CHLOE: Asking about what? Now you have to tell us!
[Message 18] MARK: It’s nothing, really. Just forget I said anything.
[Message 19] ANNA: Mark, come on! Don’t leave us hanging.
[Message 20] CHLOE: Yeah, spill! Is it about David or Sam?
[Message 21] MARK: OKAY, she asked about what kind of security the bank has. Said she was curious.
[Message 22] ANNA: That *is* a bit odd.
[Message 23] CHLOE: Maybe she's planning to rob it? Just kidding!
[Message 24] MARK: Haha, very funny, Chloe.
[Message 25] ANNA: So, Chloe, are you still going to the concert on Friday?
[Message 26] CHLOE: Yeah, definitely. I need something to take my mind off things.
[Message 27] MARK: I could really use one of those right now.
[Message 28] ANNA: Maybe we should all go out for drinks later this week?
[Message 29] CHLOE: I'm in!
[Message 30] MARK: Sounds good. Let me check my schedule.
[Message 31] ANNA: So, anything else weird happening with Jamie, Mark?
[Message 32] MARK: No, not really. Just… on edge too, I guess.
[Message 33] CHLOE: Everyone is on edge.
[Message 34] ANNA: True. But you seemed to imply it was more than that.
[Message 35] MARK: It’s probably just me being paranoid.
[Message 36] CHLOE: Probably. So, movie night this weekend at my place?
[Message 37] MARK: Sure, what are we watching?
[Message 38] ANNA: I'm in too! We should watch that new horror flick.
[Message 39] CHLOE: Deal. I’ll get the snacks.
[Message 40] MARK: I'll bring the drinks!
[Message 41] ANNA: Perfect!
[Message 42] CHLOE: This is a nice distraction. Thanks, guys.
[Message 43] MARK: Anytime, Chloe.
[Message 44] ANNA: Yeah, we're here for you.
[Message 45] CHLOE: So, anyone know any more details about what happened with David?
[Message 46] MARK: Just what's been on the news. Said something about Administering a lethal injection.
[Message 47] ANNA: That's awful! Sounds like something from a movie.
[Message 48] CHLOE: Agreed. So brutal. I wonder if the police are anywhere closer to catching the person who did it?
[Message 49] MARK: I’m sure they're working on it.
[Message 50] ANNA: Hope so. They should lock them up for life.
[Message 51] CHLOE: Agreed. Or worse.
[Message 52] MARK: Easy there, Chloe.
[Message 53] ANNA: Yeah, let’s not get carried away.
[Message 54] CHLOE: Sorry. Just… it’s hard to imagine someone doing that.
[Message 55] MARK: I know.
[Message 56] ANNA: Me too.
[Message 57] CHLOE: Anyway, I'm going to start getting ready. See you guys later?
[Message 58] MARK: Yep, later.
[Message 59] ANNA: Have a good one!
[Message 60] CHLOE: Thanks!
[Message 61] MARK: (Later) Hey Anna, you still up?
[Message 62] ANNA: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 63] MARK: I can't shake this feeling about Jamie. Remember how she was upset when Sam changed her will?
[Message 64] ANNA: A little bit but it was a while ago... She was expecting something?
[Message 65] MARK: I think so. I remember her saying she had ""intended"" to use some of it for her transition, but Sam decided to donate it instead.
[Message 66] ANNA: Wow, I didn't know that.
[Message 67] MARK: Me neither. And I'm starting to piece things together in my head and it makes me nervous.
[Message 68] ANNA: Like what?
[Message 69] MARK: Like maybe Jamie knew something about Sam working late that day.
[Message 70] ANNA: You think she was aware of the crime?
[Message 71] MARK: I dont know...maybe?
[Message 72] ANNA: This is serious, Mark. We can’t just accuse someone without proof.
[Message 73] MARK: I know, I know. I'm just saying, it’s worth considering.
[Message 74] ANNA: Maybe. But let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 75] MARK: Alright. I just needed to tell someone.
[Message 76] ANNA: I understand.
[Message 77] MARK: Thanks, Anna.
[Message 78] ANNA: Anytime. Let’s talk more tomorrow.
[Message 79] MARK: Okay. Good night.
[Message 80] ANNA: Good night.
[Message 81] JAMIE: Hey Chloe, running late. Be there in 30.
[Message 82] CHLOE: No prob. Grab me a water.
[Message 83] JAMIE: Sure thing.
[Message 84] JAMIE: (3 hours later) Hey, I have to crash. Feeling sick.
[Message 85] CHLOE: Everything ok?
[Message 86] JAMIE: Yeah, just a headache.
[Message 87] CHLOE: Get some rest!
[Message 88] JAMIE: Will do. Talk tomorrow.
[Message 89] JAMIE: (Next day) Hey Chloe, can we talk?
[Message 90] CHLOE: Sure, what's up?
[Message 91] JAMIE: Mark’s been acting weird with me.
[Message 92] CHLOE: How so?
[Message 93] JAMIE: Distant, like he's avoiding me.
[Message 94] CHLOE: He's probably just stressed about the David thing.
[Message 95] JAMIE: Maybe. But it feels personal.
[Message 96] CHLOE: I'll talk to him. See what's going on.
[Message 97] JAMIE: Thanks, I appreciate it.
[Message 98] CHLOE: No problem. Friends look out for each other.
[Message 99] JAMIE: So true. Hey, did you hear anything else about the investigation?
[Message 100] CHLOE: Nothing new. Just the same stuff on repeat.
[Message 101] JAMIE: It’s so frustrating. I just want them to catch whoever did this.
[Message 102] CHLOE: Me too. They deserve the maximum penalty.
[Message 103] JAMIE: They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 104] CHLOE: Definitely.
[Message 105] CHLOE: Hey Mark, you free to chat?
[Message 106] MARK: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 107] CHLOE: Jamie says you're acting weird.
[Message 108] MARK: I am?
[Message 109] CHLOE: Yeah, distant and avoidant. Is everything okay?
[Message 110] MARK: It’s nothing. I'm just tired.
[Message 111] CHLOE: Come on, Mark. We're friends. You can tell me.
[Message 112] MARK: Fine. I’m just… worried about her.
[Message 113] CHLOE: Worried? Why?
[Message 114] MARK: I can't say. Just… trust me.
[Message 115] CHLOE: That’s not really helpful, Mark.
[Message 116] MARK: I know, I’m sorry. It’s just… I don’t want to get involved.
[Message 117] CHLOE: Involved in what?
[Message 118] MARK: Nothing! Forget I said anything.
[Message 119] CHLOE: Mark, you're being ridiculous.
[Message 120] MARK: Look, can we just drop it?
[Message 121] CHLOE: Fine. But if something’s going on, you need to tell someone.
[Message 122] MARK: I will. Eventually.
[Message 123] CHLOE: Okay. I'm here if you need me.
[Message 124] MARK: Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 125] MARK: (Later that night) Anna, you awake?
[Message 126] ANNA: Still up. Everything okay?
[Message 127] MARK: I think I messed up.
[Message 128] ANNA: What happened?
[Message 129] MARK: Chloe asked me why I was acting weird with Jamie, and I basically confirmed something was up.
[Message 130] ANNA: Great.
[Message 131] MARK: I know, I know! I panicked. I didn’t want to lie, but I also didn't want to say anything.
[Message 132] ANNA: Well, what did you say exactly?
[Message 133] MARK: I just said I was worried about her, and that I couldn't say why.
[Message 134] ANNA: That’s not good.
[Message 135] MARK: I know! She’s going to think something’s really wrong now.
[Message 136] ANNA: Maybe you should just tell her.
[Message 137] MARK: I can't! What if I'm wrong? I don't want to accuse Jamie of something she didn't do.
[Message 138] ANNA: Okay, okay. Calm down. Let’s think about this.
[Message 139] MARK: I’m so screwed.
[Message 140] ANNA: No, you're not. We’ll figure it out. Maybe you can try to say you were just stressed about work?
[Message 141] MARK: That might work.
[Message 142] ANNA: Try that, and see how she reacts.
[Message 143] MARK: Okay. Thanks, Anna. I owe you one.
[Message 144] ANNA: Just be careful, Mark.
[Message 145] MARK: I will.
[Message 146] JAMIE: Hey Mark
[Message 147] MARK: Hey Jamie.
[Message 148] JAMIE: Chloe said you seem stressed. Is everything alright?
[Message 149] MARK: Yeah, just work stuff. Big deadline coming up.
[Message 150] JAMIE: Oh, okay. Well, let me know if you need anything.
[Message 151] MARK: Thanks, I appreciate it.
[Message 152] JAMIE: No prob. Hey, did the cops say how they found David and Sam?
[Message 153] MARK: Not really. Just said it was fast acting Administering a lethal injection.
[Message 154] JAMIE: That's so scary.
[Message 155] MARK: Yeah it is.

        *   **Attendant/Extenuating Circumstances:** References to factors that could influence culpability (e.g., victim's age in a statutory rape hypothetical, potential self-defense claims, evidence of duress, victim's own aggression leading to the crime.)
8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, it's all over the news. Some accident?
[Message 3] ANNA: Sunrise, right? Crazy.
[Message 4] DAVID: Yeah, I saw the reports. Tragic. Anyone know who it was?
[Message 5] CHLOE: They said it was Alex. 😔
[Message 6] LIAM: Alex? The bartender? No way!
[Message 7] ANNA: Poor Alex. So young.
[Message 8] DAVID: I can't believe it.
[Message 9] CHLOE: I know, right? He was always so nice.
[Message 10] LIAM: I served him once; always smiling. This is messed up.
[Message 11] ANNA: This is awful.
[Message 12] DAVID: Did they say how it happened?
[Message 13] CHLOE: Accident, that's all they're saying.
[Message 14] LIAM: Makes you think, doesn't it?
[Message 15] ANNA: Definitely. Be safe out there.
[Message 16] DAVID: Agreed.
[Message 17] CHLOE: You too.
[Message 18] LIAM: Hey, Anna, did you finish that book I lent you?
[Message 19] ANNA: Almost! Should be done by tomorrow.
[Message 20] LIAM: Cool, no rush.
[Message 21] DAVID: Speaking of books, anyone read ""Silent Patient""?
[Message 22] CHLOE: Ooh, heard good things!
[Message 23] ANNA: It’s on my list.
[Message 24] LIAM: I'm more into thrillers.
[Message 25] DAVID: I like mysteries, myself.
[Message 26] CHLOE: Anyway, about Alex…did anyone know him well?
[Message 27] LIAM: Just from the bar, like I said.
[Message 28] ANNA: Same. Casual acquaintance.
[Message 29] DAVID: I think I saw him at the gym sometimes. Never talked to him.
[Message 30] CHLOE: Okay. Just wondering.
[Message 31] LIAM: Why? You thinking something suspicious?
[Message 32] CHLOE: I don't know... it's just... sudden.
[Message 33] ANNA: Accidents happen, Chloe.
[Message 34] DAVID: Yeah, let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 35] CHLOE: Okay, okay. Just saying.
[Message 36] LIAM: So, movie night this weekend?
[Message 37] ANNA: I'm in!
[Message 38] DAVID: Count me in too.
[Message 39] CHLOE: I can bring snacks.
[Message 40] LIAM: Awesome. We need some cheering up after this news.
[Message 41] ANNA: Definitely.
[Message 42] DAVID: Agreed.
[Message 43] CHLOE: Okay, back to work. Talk later?
[Message 44] LIAM: Later.
[Message 45] ANNA: Bye!
[Message 46] DAVID: See ya.
[Message 47] GABRIEL: This whole thing with Alex is unsettling.
[Message 48] EMILY: I know, right? So sad.
[Message 49] GABRIEL: Did you hear any details?
[Message 50] EMILY: Just that it was an accident near the library.
[Message 51] GABRIEL: Weird place for an accident.
[Message 52] EMILY: I know. I was supposed to meet him for coffee there next week.
[Message 53] GABRIEL: You were? That's awful, Emily.
[Message 54] EMILY: Yeah, we were working on a project together.
[Message 55] GABRIEL: What kind of project?
[Message 56] EMILY: Just some research for a client.
[Message 57] GABRIEL: Hmmm.
[Message 58] EMILY: Why hmmm?
[Message 59] GABRIEL: Just seems like a coincidence. Bad timing.
[Message 60] EMILY: What are you implying, Gabriel?
[Message 61] GABRIEL: Nothing! Just saying it's strange.
[Message 62] EMILY: Look, I'm grieving. Don't start with me.
[Message 63] GABRIEL: Sorry, Emily. Didn't mean to upset you.
[Message 64] EMILY: It's fine. Just...leave it alone.
[Message 65] GABRIEL: Okay.
[Message 66] EMILY: I need to go.
[Message 67] GABRIEL: Yeah, take care.
[Message 68] ANNA: Hey Chloe, you still thinking about Alex?
[Message 69] CHLOE: Yeah, it's bothering me. Something feels off.
[Message 70] ANNA: Like what?
[Message 71] CHLOE: I don't know...I saw Emily talking to Alex a few days ago.
[Message 72] ANNA: And? Emily knew Alex.
[Message 73] CHLOE: Yeah, but she looked really intense. Like she was warning him about something.
[Message 74] ANNA: Maybe it was nothing.
[Message 75] CHLOE: Maybe.
[Message 76] ANNA: You're too suspicious, Chloe.
[Message 77] CHLOE: I just have a feeling.
[Message 78] ANNA: Well, don't go spreading rumors.
[Message 79] CHLOE: I won't. Just needed to vent.
[Message 80] ANNA: Okay. Want to grab coffee later?
[Message 81] CHLOE: Sure. That would be nice.
[Message 82] ANNA: Good. See you at 3?
[Message 83] CHLOE: Perfect.
[Message 84] EMILY: Gabriel, can we talk?
[Message 85] GABRIEL: Sure, what's up?
[Message 86] EMILY: I didn't like what you implied earlier.
[Message 87] GABRIEL: I apologized, Emily.
[Message 88] EMILY: I know, but it's still bothering me.
[Message 89] GABRIEL: I was just surprised you were working with Alex.
[Message 90] EMILY: It was just a freelance thing. I needed the money.
[Message 91] GABRIEL: Right.
[Message 92] EMILY: Look, I'm stressed out. I need you to trust me.
[Message 93] GABRIEL: I do trust you, Emily.
[Message 94] EMILY: Then stop questioning me.
[Message 95] GABRIEL: Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
[Message 96] EMILY: Thanks.
[Message 97] GABRIEL: Everything will be alright.
[Message 98] EMILY: I hope so.
[Message 99] DAVID: Liam, you okay? You seem quiet today.
[Message 100] LIAM: Just thinking about Alex. It's messed up.
[Message 101] DAVID: Yeah, it is. Anything else on your mind?
[Message 102] LIAM: Nah, just processing it.
[Message 103] DAVID: Want to grab a beer later?
[Message 104] LIAM: Maybe. I'll see how I feel.
[Message 105] DAVID: Alright. Just let me know.
[Message 106] LIAM: Cool.
[Message 107] ANNA: Chloe, coffee was great! Thanks.
[Message 108] CHLOE: Anytime! Glad we could catch up.
[Message 109] ANNA: Me too. Feel a bit better now.
[Message 110] CHLOE: Me too. Still can't shake the feeling about Emily, though.
[Message 111] ANNA: Give it a rest, Chloe. Honestly.
[Message 112] CHLOE: Okay, okay. I will.
[Message 113] ANNA: Good. See you Saturday?
[Message 114] CHLOE: Definitely!
[Message 115] ANNA: Perfect!
[Message 116] LIAM: David, you still up for that beer?
[Message 117] DAVID: Yeah, man. Meet you at The Tavern in an hour?
[Message 118] LIAM: Sounds good. See you there.
[Message 119] DAVID: Cool.
[Message 120] EMILY: Gabriel, I'm scared.
[Message 121] GABRIEL: What's wrong?
[Message 122] EMILY: The police called me. They want to ask me about Alex.
[Message 123] GABRIEL: What? Why?
[Message 124] EMILY: Because I was working with him! They said it's standard procedure.
[Message 125] GABRIEL: Okay, don't panic. Just tell them the truth.
[Message 126] EMILY: But what if they don't believe me?
[Message 127] GABRIEL: They will. You have nothing to hide, right?
[Message 128] EMILY: Right. I have nothing to hide. I didn't intend for any of this to happen, but now I'm thinking this is too severe of a crime to go unpunished.
[Message 129] GABRIEL: Exactly. So just be honest.
[Message 130] EMILY: Okay. I'll try.
[Message 131] GABRIEL: You got this.
[Message 132] DAVID: Liam, you seem really on edge. What's going on?
[Message 133] LIAM: It's nothing, man. Just a long day.
[Message 134] DAVID: You sure? You're acting weird.
[Message 135] LIAM: I'm fine, David. Drop it.
[Message 136] DAVID: Okay, okay. Just checking.
[Message 137] LIAM: Thanks.
[Message 138] DAVID: So, you think they'll find out what really happened to Alex? I heard the manager was making a lot of enemies with his new rules.
[Message 139] LIAM: I hope so. Justice needs to be served. Even if it means a long prison sentence for someone.
[Message 140] CHLOE: Anna, I was thinking...Emily seemed to be at Library more often lately.
[Message 141] ANNA: So? Maybe she likes books.
[Message 142] CHLOE: I don't know, it just feels...convenient.
[Message 143] ANNA: You're grasping at straws, Chloe.
[Message 144] CHLOE: Maybe you're right.
[Message 145] ANNA: I am right. Let the police do their job.
[Message 146] CHLOE: Fine. But I still don't trust her.
[Message 147] ANNA: That's your problem.
[Message 148] GABRIEL: How did it go with the police, Emily?
[Message 149] EMILY: It was awful, Gabriel. They kept asking me about my relationship with Alex.
[Message 150] GABRIEL: And what did you say?
[Message 151] EMILY: I told them the truth! That we were just working together.
[Message 152] GABRIEL: Did they seem to believe you?
[Message 153] EMILY: I don't know. They were being so vague.
[Message 154] GABRIEL: Well, at least it's over.
[Message 155] EMILY: I hope so.
[Message 156] GABRIEL: You need to relax, Emily. It's going to be okay.
[Message 157] EMILY: I wish I could believe that.
[Message 158] DAVID: So, Liam, you think Alex's death was just an accident?
[Message 159] LIAM: I don't know what to think, David. It's all just messed up. I saw her buying some Car accident (vehicular homicide) last week.
[Message 160] DAVID: Emily? You saw Emily buying Car accident (vehicular homicide)? When was this?
[Message 161] LIAM: Yeah, at the hardware store. It was just a quick glance, but I'm sure it was her. It had to have happened right before he went over there.
[Message 162] DAVID: That's... concerning. You should tell the police.
[Message 163] LIAM: I don't know, man. I don't want to get involved.
[Message 164] DAVID: But Alex is dead, Liam! He always hated Alex . Someone needs to do something.
[Message 165] LIAM: I know, I know. I'll think about it.
[Message 166] DAVID: Don't wait too long, Liam.
[Message 167] LIAM: Okay.
[Message 168] CHLOE: Anna, Liam told David that he saw Emily buying Car accident (vehicular homicide).
[Message 169] ANNA: What?! Are you serious?
[Message 170] CHLOE: Dead serious. He didn't want to get involved.
[Message 171] ANNA: This is crazy.
[Message 172] CHLOE: I know! I knew something was up with her!
[Message 173] ANNA: We need to tell the police.
[Message 174] CHLOE: I agree. Let's go together.
[Message 175] ANNA: Okay. Meet me in 30 minutes?
[Message 176] CHLOE: Perfect. This is it.
[Message 177] ANNA: Let's hope they get her. He said she wanted to get rid of him.
[Message 178] ANNA: The police need to act fast.
[Message 179] ANNA: This is for Alex.
[Message 180] CHLOE: For Alex.

[Message 2] Kai: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. Greenville PD must be going nuts.
[Message 3] Riley: Seriously. I was just there yesterday getting coffee.
[Message 4] Jamie: Did you know either of them?
[Message 5] Riley: Nah, not personally. Heard whispers about a new judge, Mrs. Eleanor Vance. And I think a Corrections Officer named Melissa, maybe?
[Message 6] Kai: Eleanor Vance? Damn. She ruled on my brother's case last year.
[Message 7] Jamie: Oh wow, small world.
[Message 8] Riley: What was she like?
[Message 9] Kai: Cynical. That's the only word for it. Didn't seem to care about anyone.
[Message 10] Jamie: I'm just shocked something like this happened here.
[Message 11] Riley: Me too. Anyone know any details?
[Message 12] Kai: Just what's on the news. Stabbing with a knife. Brutal.
[Message 13] Jamie: Ugh, graphic. Makes me sick.
[Message 14] Riley: Speaking of sick, I think I'm catching a cold. Gonna grab some soup.
[Message 15] Kai: Feel better!
[Message 16] Jamie: Yeah, get some rest.
[Message 17] Riley: Thanks, guys.
[Message 18] Kai: Jamie, you working tonight?
[Message 19] Jamie: No, thankfully. Day off. Why?
[Message 20] Kai: Just curious. I'm picking up a shift at the diner.
[Message 21] Jamie: Make that bread!
[Message 22] Kai: Trying to! Bills are killer.
[Message 23] Jamie: Tell me about it.
[Message 24] Riley: (Later) Guys, I can't sleep. Still thinking about those murders.
[Message 25] Jamie: Me too, Riley. It's messing with my head.
[Message 26] Kai: Maybe we should all get together tomorrow, take our minds off it?
[Message 27] Riley: That sounds good. Movie night?
[Message 28] Jamie: I'm in. I'll bring the popcorn.
[Message 29] Kai: I can grab some drinks. What time?
[Message 30] Riley: How about 7?
[Message 31] Jamie: Perfect.
[Message 32] Kai: Cool. See you then.
[Message 33] Riley: Night!
[Message 34] Jamie: Night guys.
[Message 35] Kai: (Next day) Hey, did either of you know Melissa personally?
[Message 36] Jamie: I think I've seen her around, maybe at the gym? Why?
[Message 37] Kai: Just wondering. Heard she and Eleanor Vance might have been involved somehow. Maybe romantically.
[Message 38] Riley: Woah, really? Where did you hear that?
[Message 39] Kai: Just rumors, you know how Greenville is. Everyone knows everyone's business.
[Message 40] Jamie: True. But that's a serious rumor.
[Message 41] Riley: Yeah, be careful spreading stuff like that.
[Message 42] Kai: I'm not spreading anything, just repeating what I heard.
[Message 43] Jamie: Right, right. So, movie night still on?
[Message 44] Kai: Yep! Just finishing up at work.
[Message 45] Riley: Cool. I'm picking up some candy.
[Message 46] Jamie: Awesome. See you guys soon.
[Message 47] Kai: Later.

[Message 50] Kai: Just tired. Long day.
[Message 51] Riley: Yeah, you seem distant. Something on your mind?
[Message 52] Kai: Nah, just the murders, I guess. It's a lot to process.
[Message 53] Jamie: I get it. Me too.
[Message 54] Riley: We're here if you need to talk, Kai.
[Message 55] Kai: Thanks, guys. I appreciate that.

[Message 60] Riley: (The next day) Okay, has anyone heard any updates?
[Message 61] Jamie: Nothing new on the news.
[Message 62] Kai: My brother said the cops are looking at everyone who worked at the Warehouse.
[Message 63] Riley: Well, that makes sense. Gotta start somewhere.
[Message 64] Jamie: Did you ever work there, Kai?
[Message 65] Kai: Briefly, a few years back. Why?
[Message 66] Jamie: No reason, just curious.
[Message 67] Riley: I heard they found a Stabbing with a knife.
[Message 68] Jamie: Damn. That's rough.
[Message 69] Kai: Yeah, they're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 70] Riley: Hope they catch whoever did it soon.
[Message 71] Jamie: Me too. This whole thing is unsettling.
[Message 72] Kai: Tell me about it.
[Message 73] Riley: Anyone else have a weird feeling about all this?
[Message 74] Jamie: Weird how?
[Message 75] Riley: I don't know, just…off.
[Message 76] Kai: Maybe we're just on edge.
[Message 77] Jamie: Probably.
[Message 78] Riley: So, anyone doing anything fun this weekend?
[Message 79] Jamie: Thinking of hitting up the art museum.
[Message 80] Kai: Cool. I might just chill at home.
[Message 81] Riley: Sounds relaxing.
[Message 82] Jamie: Yeah, recharge the batteries.
[Message 83] Kai: Exactly.
[Message 84] Riley: Gotta run, errands to do. Talk later!
[Message 85] Jamie: Bye!
[Message 86] Kai: Later!
[Message 87] Jamie: (Later that day) Hey Kai, random question – you ever get the feeling someone is watching you?
[Message 88] Kai: Sometimes, yeah. Paranoid, maybe. Why?
[Message 89] Jamie: Just wondering. I keep seeing this same car parked down the street.
[Message 90] Kai: Could be anyone. Don't sweat it.
[Message 91] Jamie: Easier said than done.
[Message 92] Kai: Maybe you should report it to the police.
[Message 93] Jamie: Nah, I'm probably just being dramatic.
[Message 94] Kai: True.
[Message 95] Riley: (Next morning) Guys, I had the worst nightmare last night.
[Message 96] Jamie: About the murders?
[Message 97] Riley: Yeah, it was so vivid.
[Message 98] Kai: Nightmares are the worst.
[Message 99] Jamie: I hate them.
[Message 100] Riley: Me too.
[Message 101] Kai: Did you guys hear that the Eleanor Vance was known as very Cynical?
[Message 102] Jamie: Who would kill those woman?
[Message 103] Riley: Exactly!
[Message 104] Kai: Anyway, hope you feel better today.
[Message 105] Jamie: Me too.
[Message 106] Riley: Thanks, guys.
[Message 107] Jamie: So, anyone doing anything interesting today?
[Message 108] Kai: Probably just laundry. Exciting, I know.
[Message 109] Riley: The epitome of excitement.
[Message 110] Jamie: I'm gonna try to finish that painting I started.
[Message 111] Kai: Nice! You're so creative.
[Message 112] Riley: Show us when you're done!
[Message 113] Jamie: Will do!
[Message 114] Kai: Gotta run, laundry calls.
[Message 115] Jamie: Bye!
[Message 116] Riley: Later!
[Message 117] Kai: (Later that afternoon) Hey, you guys free to talk? I'm feeling really stressed.
[Message 118] Jamie: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 119] Riley: I'm here. What's going on?
[Message 120] Kai: I just... I heard something that's really bothering me.
[Message 121] Jamie: What is it?
[Message 122] Kai: Someone said… someone said I looked ""relieved"" after the news broke about Eleanor Vance and Melissa.
[Message 123] Riley: Who said that?
[Message 124] Kai: Doesn't matter. The point is, it's making me look suspicious.
[Message 125] Jamie: That's ridiculous. People are just talking.
[Message 126] Riley: Yeah, ignore them.
[Message 127] Kai: Easy for you to say. You're not the one being scrutinized.
[Message 128] Jamie: I know, but you can't let it get to you.
[Message 129] Riley: Exactly. Don't give them the satisfaction.
[Message 130] Kai: But what if they start digging? What if they find something?
[Message 131] Jamie: Find what? You didn't do anything wrong, did you?
[Message 132] Kai: Of course not! But… people talk. Things get twisted.
[Message 133] Riley: Just stay calm and cooperate with the police if they contact you.
[Message 134] Jamie: Yeah, that's all you can do.
[Message 135] Kai: I guess you're right.
[Message 136] Riley: We're here for you, Kai. Don't forget that.
[Message 137] Jamie: Always.
[Message 138] Kai: Thanks, guys. I really needed to hear that.
[Message 139] Riley: Anytime.
[Message 140] Jamie: So, wanna watch a cheesy movie to take your mind off things?
[Message 141] Kai: That actually sounds amazing.
[Message 142] Riley: I'm in! Pizza's on me.
[Message 143] Jamie: Score!
[Message 144] Kai: You guys are the best.
[Message 145] Riley: We know.
[Message 146] Jamie: Haha. So, 7 again?
[Message 147] Kai: Perfect.
[Message 148] Riley: See you then!
[Message 149] Jamie: Later!
[Message 150] Kai: (A few days later) Hey guys, I need to tell you something. It's about Afternoon, the day of the murders.
[Message 151] Jamie: What about it?
[Message 152] Riley: This is serious, right?
[Message 153] Kai: I saw Jamie leaving the Warehouse around Afternoon. She had a bag with her.
[Message 154] Jamie: What?! That's a lie!
[Message 155] Riley: Jamie, is this true?
[Message 156] Jamie: No! I was at the art supply store all Afternoon. I was buying Stabbing with a knife for a project!
[Message 157] Kai: Why didn't you say anything before?
[Message 158] Jamie: Because it's none of your business! And I didn't think it was relevant!
[Message 159] Riley: Jamie, you need to tell the police this.
[Message 160] Jamie: I will, but Kai is making it sound like I'm guilty!
[Message 161] Kai: I'm just saying what I saw. I didn't know what to think.
[Message 162] Riley: Okay, everyone calm down. We need to think rationally.
[Message 163] Jamie: He knew I wanted to get rid of the Corrections Officer because she treated me like dirt.
[Message 164] Jamie: Kai, why are you doing this?
[Message 165] Kai: I told you, I just want to be honest. I should have stopped the murders from even happening.
[Message 166] Riley: Jamie, do you have any proof you were at the art supply store?
[Message 167] Jamie: I have the receipt! I can show you!
[Message 168] Kai: What kind of sicko needs that type of Stabbing with a knife?
[Message 169] Riley: Okay, okay. Let's see the receipt, Jamie. And Kai, please just let her explain.
[Message 170] Jamie: Give me a minute, I need to find it. This is insane!
[Message 171] Kai: Her shouting probably provoked him.
[Message 172] Riley: Jamie if he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened, according to my brother who worked with Eleanor Vance.
[Message 173] Jamie: My receipt says it was 5:00 PM at the art store, but I did talk to Melissa at 1:00 PM about something personal.
[Message 174] Riley: Ok guys, can we talk in person to figure this all out?
[Message 175] Jamie: Sure, at my place at 7pm?
[Message 176] Kai: I will be there at 6:45 PM.
[Message 177] Riley: Ok see you both soon.
[Message 178] Jamie: Bye.
[Message 179] Riley: Bye.
[Message 180] Kai: Bye.

[Message 2] Mark: Yeah, crazy. Someone died.
[Message 3] Sarah: I know, right? Poor kid. 9.  Bartender, they said.
[Message 4] Mark: Newark's getting rougher. Ugh, anyway, you still up for pizza tonight?
[Message 5] Sarah: Definitely. Need some comfort food after hearing that.
[Message 6] David: Pizza sounds good. What time?
[Message 7] Mark: 7 PM at Bella Notte?
[Message 8] David: Sounds good. So, you guys knew 9.  Bartender?
[Message 9] Sarah: Met him once. Seemed nice enough. A bit cynical, maybe.
[Message 10] Mark: Yeah, just a kid.
[Message 11] David: This is awful. I hate this.
[Message 12] Sarah: Me too, David.
[Message 13] Mark: Police got any leads?
[Message 14] Sarah: No clue. Just that it was Asphyxiation by strangulation.
[Message 15] David: That’s… brutal. I need a drink.
[Message 16] Sarah: After pizza, maybe?
[Message 17] David: Sounds like a plan. I need to take my mind off of this.
[Message 18] Mark: Agreed. Let’s just try and relax tonight.
[Message 19] Sarah: I saw Chandra near the dealership yesterday Afternoon. Anyone know why?
[Message 20] Mark: Chandra? No idea. She works downtown, right?
[Message 21] David: Yeah, she does. Maybe she was car shopping?
[Message 22] Sarah: Could be. Just seemed odd.
[Message 23] Mark: People go to car dealerships all the time, Sarah. Don’t overthink it.
[Message 24] Sarah: Okay, okay. Just saying.
[Message 25] David: Is it bad I'm relieved I don't know anyone involved?
[Message 26] Sarah: Not at all. It's normal to feel that way.
[Message 27] Mark: We all are, dude.
[Message 28] David: Guess so. Still messed up though.
[Message 29] Sarah: Totally.
[Message 30] Mark: So, pizza at 7?
[Message 31] Sarah: Yes, pizza at 7.
[Message 32] David: See you both then.
[Message 33] Sarah: Later.
[Message 34] Mark: Later.
[Message 35] Chandra: Hey Sarah, you free to chat?
[Message 36] Sarah: Hey Chandra. Yeah, what’s up?
[Message 37] Chandra: Just wanted to check in. You seemed a little off earlier.
[Message 38] Sarah: Just the news, you know? About 9.  Bartender
[Message 39] Chandra: Yeah, terrible. I heard they're going away for a long time for this. Scary.
[Message 40] Sarah: Super scary.
[Message 41] Chandra: Listen, about yesterday... I was getting my car serviced near the dealership.
[Message 42] Sarah: Oh, okay. Makes sense.
[Message 43] Chandra: Yeah, just didn’t want you to think anything weird.
[Message 44] Sarah: No worries.
[Message 45] Chandra: Did you see Leo around at all lately?
[Message 46] Sarah: Leo? Not recently. Why?
[Message 47] Chandra: Just haven’t heard from him in a while. He was always talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 48] Sarah: That's not a good look.
[Message 49] Chandra: Right? I'm a bit worried about him.
[Message 50] Sarah: Maybe you should check on him.
[Message 51] Chandra: Yeah, maybe. I'll think about it. Thanks, Sarah.
[Message 52] Sarah: Anytime.
[Message 53] Leo: Chandra, need to talk.
[Message 54] Chandra: What's up, Leo?
[Message 55] Leo: You didn't tell anyone about… you know… did you?
[Message 56] Chandra: About what, Leo? Be specific.
[Message 57] Leo: About me being at the dealership. About what I said.
[Message 58] Chandra: I might have mentioned you were hard up for cash.
[Message 59] Leo: Chandra! That's not helping!
[Message 60] Chandra: I didn't say anything else. Relax. Why? What did you do?
[Message 61] Leo: Nothing! Just… stressed.
[Message 62] Chandra: Stressed enough to… I don’t know… hurt someone?
[Message 63] Leo: No! Of course not! I’m not a monster.
[Message 64] Chandra: Then why are you acting so weird?
[Message 65] Leo: Because this whole thing is freaking me out, okay? Someone is dead.
[Message 66] Chandra: I know. But you need to calm down. Acting guilty makes you look guilty.
[Message 67] Leo: Easy for you to say. You weren't there.
[Message 68] Chandra: Where were you yesterday Afternoon?
[Message 69] Leo: I was… uh… at home.
[Message 70] Chandra: All Afternoon?
[Message 71] Leo: Mostly. I went out for a bit. To get groceries.
[Message 72] Chandra: Groceries? What did you buy?
[Message 73] Leo: Just… stuff. Milk, bread, you know.
[Message 74] Chandra: Did you buy Asphyxiation by strangulation at the store?
[Message 75] Leo: What? No! What the hell is wrong with you?
[Message 76] Chandra: Just trying to help you. But you're not making it easy.
[Message 77] Leo: I don't need your help. Just leave me alone.
[Message 78] Chandra: Fine. But if you're involved, you need to turn yourself in.
[Message 79] Leo: I said I wasn’t! God, just go away.
[Message 80] Chandra: Okay, okay. I'm going.
[Message 81] David: Hey Sarah, something's bugging me.
[Message 82] Sarah: What's up, David?
[Message 83] David: Remember how you saw Chandra near the dealership?
[Message 84] Sarah: Yeah?
[Message 85] David: Well, I saw Leo leaving the building at Afternoon.
[Message 86] Sarah: Leo? Seriously?
[Message 87] David: Yeah, I'm sure of it. He looked really agitated.
[Message 88] Sarah: That's… not good. Did you tell the police?
[Message 89] David: Not yet. I wanted to talk to you first.
[Message 90] Sarah: Maybe you should. This is important.
[Message 91] David: You think so? I don't want to get involved.
[Message 92] Sarah: You already are involved, David. You have information.
[Message 93] David: I know, I know. It's just… scary.
[Message 94] Sarah: I understand. But think about 9.  Bartender and his family.
[Message 95] David: Okay, you're right. I'll call them tomorrow.
[Message 96] Sarah: Good. Thanks, David.
[Message 97] David: No problem.
[Message 98] Mark: So, anyone hear anything new about the case?
[Message 99] Sarah: David saw Leo leaving the dealership at Afternoon.
[Message 100] Mark: Wow. Leo? That's surprising.
[Message 101] David: Yeah, I'm still processing it.
[Message 102] Mark: Did you tell the cops?
[Message 103] David: Planning to tomorrow.
[Message 104] Mark: Good. He always hated 9.  Bartender.
[Message 105] Sarah: Really? Why?
[Message 106] Mark: Some drama at the bar they both worked at. 9.  Bartender got him fired, I think.
[Message 107] Sarah: That's a motive, alright.
[Message 108] David: He was looking up how to make Asphyxiation by strangulation online.
[Message 109] Mark: Seriously? This keeps getting worse.
[Message 110] Sarah: Tell the police everything, David. Everything.
[Message 111] David: I will.
[Message 112] Mark: This could be it, guys. This could be the guy.
[Message 113] Sarah: Let's hope so. For 9.  Bartender's sake.
[Message 114] David: Agreed.
[Message 115] Chandra: Leo just called me. He's freaking out.
[Message 116] Sarah: What did he say?
[Message 117] Chandra: He thinks he's being framed. Says he was nowhere near the dealership.
[Message 118] Sarah: But David saw him.
[Message 119] Chandra: He said David is lying. Or mistaken.
[Message 120] Sarah: Hard to say. David seemed pretty sure.
[Message 121] Chandra: He says he was trying to find a car to start a rideshare thing.
[Message 122] Sarah: Rideshare? That's random.
[Message 123] Chandra: I know, right? It's all very strange.
[Message 124] Sarah: He's definitely hiding something.
[Message 125] Chandra: That's what I think.
[Message 126] Sarah: Did he say anything else incriminating?
[Message 127] Chandra: No, he clammed up. Just kept saying he's innocent.
[Message 128] Sarah: Innocent people don't act like that.
[Message 129] Chandra: Tell me about it.
[Message 130] David: I told the police everything. About Leo.
[Message 131] Sarah: Good. You did the right thing.
[Message 132] David: I hope so. I feel terrible.
[Message 133] Sarah: You shouldn't. You helped.
[Message 134] David: They asked me if I saw anyone else. I didn’t.
[Message 135] Sarah: Well, that's all you can do.
[Message 136] David: They said they are bringing him in for questioning.
[Message 137] Sarah: Hopefully, they'll get to the truth.
[Message 138] David: Yeah.
[Message 139] Mark: So, Leo's officially a suspect?
[Message 140] Sarah: Seems that way.
[Message 141] Mark: Good. Justice for 9.  Bartender.
[Message 142] Sarah: Agreed.
[Message 143] David: I hope they find out for sure.
[Message 144] Mark: They will. With David's help.
[Message 145] Sarah: Yeah, thanks, David.
[Message 146] David: Anytime.
[Message 147] Chandra: This is insane. They arrested Leo.
[Message 148] Sarah: I know. I saw.
[Message 149] Chandra: I feel awful.
[Message 150] Sarah: Why? You didn't do anything wrong.
[Message 151] Chandra: I just… I feel like I pushed him over the edge.
[Message 152] Sarah: You didn't. He made his own choices.
[Message 153] Chandra: Maybe.
[Message 154] Sarah: It's not your fault, Chandra. Remember that.
[Message 155] Chandra: Thanks, Sarah.
[Message 156] Sarah: Anytime.
[Message 157] Chandra: I gotta go.
[Message 158] Sarah: Okay. Take care.
[Message 159] Chandra: You too.
[Message 160] Mark: Police called me.
[Message 161] Sarah: What did they want?
[Message 162] Mark: Just asking about my relationship with 9.  Bartender and Leo.
[Message 163] Sarah: Did you tell them about the bar fight?
[Message 164] Mark: Yeah, everything.
[Message 165] Sarah: Good.
[Message 166] Mark: They asked if I knew anything about Asphyxiation by strangulation. Weird.
[Message 167] Sarah: Just covering all bases, I guess.
[Message 168] Mark: Yeah. Hope they nail Leo.
[Message 169] Sarah: Me too.
[Message 170] Mark: Anyway, wanna watch a movie tomorrow? Need to unwind.
[Message 171] Sarah: Sounds good.
[Message 172] Mark: Cool. Later.
[Message 173] Sarah: Later.
[Message 174] David: Cops just left.
[Message 175] Sarah: How did it go?
[Message 176] David: They wanted to know why I waited so long to come forward.
[Message 177] Sarah: What did you say?
[Message 178] David: I told them I was scared. Which is true.
[Message 179] Sarah: Good.
[Message 180] David: They seemed to buy it.
[Message 181] Sarah: I'm glad.
[Message 182] David: Still feels weird. I really didn't think much of it at the time.
[Message 183] Sarah: You did what you had to do.
[Message 184] David: Yeah.
[Message 185] Sarah: We all did.
[Message 186] David: This whole thing is so messed up.
[Message 187] Sarah: Tell me about it.
[Message 188] David: I need a long vacation.
[Message 189] Sarah: Me too.
[Message 190] David: Well, good night.

[Message 6] LIAM: Sarah? Oh man, I knew her from the activist group.

[Message 8] BEN: The cops will find them. Beaumont PD is usually on top of things.
[Message 9] CHLOE: You think it was a robbery gone wrong?
[Message 10] LIAM: Maybe. Or something personal. Sarah was pretty outspoken.
[Message 11] ANNA: Liam, don't go spreading rumors. It's insensitive.
[Message 12] LIAM: Just saying, she made enemies. Remember that protest at the mall last month?
[Message 13] BEN: I missed that. What was it about?
[Message 14] LIAM: Some environmental thing. She was leading the charge.

[Message 21] CHLOE: Seriously? That's horrible!
[Message 22] BEN: Wow, that's... unusual. Not exactly your run-of-the-mill crime.
[Message 23] ANNA: Maybe Mike, the Corrections Officer, had something to do with it? Maybe he was targeted?
[Message 24] CHLOE: What do you mean, Anna?
[Message 25] ANNA: I don't know, prisons, gangs, maybe he knew too much or something.
[Message 26] BEN: Reaching a bit, aren't we?
[Message 27] LIAM: Yeah, Anna. That's a stretch. Although, Mike was always ambitious, I heard.
[Message 28] CHLOE: You guys are all speculating. Let's just wait for the police report.
[Message 29] BEN: Good idea, Chloe. By the way, anyone up for pizza tonight? Distract ourselves.
[Message 30] ANNA: I'm in. I need a distraction.
[Message 31] LIAM: Count me in too.
[Message 32] CHLOE: Okay, pizza sounds good.
[Message 33] ANNA: I saw Jess at the mall yesterday. She looked really stressed.
[Message 34] BEN: Jess? The one who works at the perfume store?

[Message 36] LIAM: Wait, seriously? She bought Poisoning via inhalation? When?
[Message 37] ANNA: Around 6 pm I think. She said it was for some project at work or something.

[Message 2] Jordan: Heard what? Spill!
[Message 3] Casey: Yeah, I'm out of the loop.
[Message 4] Riley: Two people are dead! It was Arson by setting a fire at Night, apparently.
[Message 5] Jordan: What?! That's insane! Who were they?
[Message 6] Casey: Oh god, that's awful. Playground is so close to me.
[Message 7] Riley: It was Delia and Marco.
[Message 8] Jordan: Delia?! No way! I knew her. She was always so kind. What about Marco?
[Message 9] Casey: Marco...wasn't he the security guard there? He let me in once when I forgot my ID.
[Message 10] Riley: Yeah, the Security Guard. And Delia, the Taxi Driver. This is so messed up.
[Message 11] Jordan: Did they say how it happened? Any suspects?
[Message 12] Casey: I heard whispers about it being an accident. A faulty electrical wire, maybe?
[Message 13] Riley: Accident my ass. Someone purposefully did this. I overheard Vinny saying he always hated Delia.
[Message 14] Jordan: Vinny? Seriously? He seemed like such a chill dude.
[Message 15] Casey: Vinny has been acting weird. He was buying Arson by setting a fire at the store on Monday.
[Message 16] Riley: See! I knew it!
[Message 17] Jordan: Hold on, buying Arson by setting a fire doesn't automatically make him a killer. Maybe he was just messing around. Hope they don't get the death penalty for this.
[Message 18] Casey: True, but I also heard him arguing with Delia last week about something...sounded intense.
[Message 19] Riley: About what? We need to tell the cops everything we know.
[Message 20] Jordan: Whoa, easy there, Riley. Let's not jump to conclusions. What if we're wrong?
[Message 21] Casey: I don't know the details, but I remember him saying something like ""I intend to make you pay"" to Delia before he left.
[Message 22] Riley: That's it! That's Mens Rea right there! He intended it! The guy's a psycho!
[Message 23] Jordan: Okay, okay, but let's not forget about Alex. They were always complaining about Marco being a business competitor.
[Message 24] Casey: Alex? With the gold tooth? Really?
[Message 25] Riley: I don't buy it. Alex is all talk. Vinny is another story.
[Message 26] Jordan: I just heard from someone that Alex was looking up how to make Arson by setting a fire online last month.
[Message 27] Casey: What?! That's even worse than Vinny!
[Message 28] Riley: You two are acting like you're Sherlock Holmes all of a sudden. Maybe we should focus on something else... Did you see that sale at the mall?
[Message 29] Jordan: Riley, this is serious! Two people are dead! The victims’ lives mattered. How can you think about shopping right now?
[Message 30] Casey: Yeah, Riley, that's kinda insensitive. Even though Vinny was talking about hurting Delia right before he went over there, I can't say for sure he did anything. He's never been violent before.
[Message 31] Riley: Fine, fine. But don't come crying to me when it turns out to be Vinny and you guys were too busy defending him. I just have a feeling.
[Message 32] Jordan: A feeling isn't evidence, Riley. Remember that time you were convinced Mrs. Gable was a witch?
[Message 33] Casey: Let’s just give the police the information and let them sort it out. We could be wrong.
[Message 34] Riley: Whatever. I'm still convinced Vinny is involved. It's just...obvious.
[Message 35] Jordan: Let's hope they find whoever did this soon. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 86] Chloe: I'm just saying, his reaction seems off. Plus, he knew her more than he said.
[Message 87] David: He was looking up how to make Hitting with a golf club online.
[Message 88] Maya: Maybe we should just let the police handle it.
[Message 89] Chloe: You're right. But I'm still keeping an eye on him.
[Message 90] David: Me too.
[Message 91] Liam: Pizza’s here! You guys on your way?
[Message 92] Maya: Almost there!
[Message 93] David: On my way.
[Message 94] Chloe: I really hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 95] Maya: Me too. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 96] David: They deserve it.
[Message 97] Liam: What's everyone talking about?
[Message 98] Maya: Just about how terrible the whole situation is.
[Message 99] David: Yeah, nothing important.
[Message 100] Chloe: Did the police say anything about suspects?
[Message 101] Maya: Not that I heard.
[Message 102] Liam: They’ll figure it out. They always do.
[Message 103] David: Hope so.
[Message 104] Chloe: Me too.
[Message 105] Liam: Anyone want a drink with this pizza?
[Message 106] Maya: Sure! I'll take a soda.
[Message 107] David: Beer for me.
[Message 108] Chloe: Just water for me, thanks.
[Message 109] Maya: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened
[Message 110] David: Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.
[Message 111] Chloe: You guys are so insensitive.
[Message 112] Liam: What are you guys talking about? This is getting weird.
[Message 113] Maya: Nothing, Liam. Just girl talk.
[Message 114] David: Yeah, nothing you need to worry about.
[Message 115] Chloe: Whatever.
[Message 116] Maya: This pizza is amazing, by the way.
[Message 117] David: Agreed.
[Message 118] Liam: Told you!
[Message 119] Chloe: The manager must be turning in his grave.
[Message 120] Maya: Wow, Chloe, that's a little harsh.
[Message 121] David: Yeah, tone it down.
[Message 122] Liam: Seriously. Let’s just enjoy the pizza.
[Message 123] Chloe: Okay, okay. Sorry.
[Message 124] Maya: Apology accepted.
[Message 125] David: Good.
[Message 126] Liam: (Private message to David) Meet me outside in five? I need to talk to you.
[Message 127] David: (Private message to Liam) About what?
[Message 128] Liam: (Private message to David) Just meet me. It's important.
[Message 129] David: (Private message to Liam) Fine. Five minutes.
[Message 130] Maya: You guys are being so secretive all of a sudden! What's going on?

[Message 2] Jamie: No, what's up?
[Message 3] Alex: Someone got killed. Brutal, apparently.
[Message 4] Jamie: Seriously? At Nightclub? Wow.
[Message 5] Alex: Yeah, pretty messed up.
[Message 6] Jamie: Who was it? Anyone we know?
[Message 7] Alex: 6.  Drug Dealer, goes by River.
[Message 8] Jamie: River? Damn, I knew River. Sold me stuff a few times.
[Message 9] Alex: Police said it was Blunt force trauma with a hammer.
[Message 10] Jamie: That's horrific. Any suspects?
[Message 11] Alex: Rumor is they're looking at Kai. I heard Kai didn't like River.
[Message 12] Jamie: Kai? Really? I know Kai. What’s the motive?
[Message 13] Alex: Apparently, some kind of political motive.
[Message 14] Jamie: Political? River was a drug dealer, not a politician. Doesn’t add up.
[Message 15] Alex: That's what I thought too.
[Message 16] Jamie: Did they catch Kai?
[Message 17] Alex: Not yet, but they’re questioning everyone who was at Nightclub.
[Message 18] Jamie: I wasn't even there that night. Thank god.
[Message 19] Alex: Lucky you.
[Message 20] Jamie: I was at home, watching that dumb reality show.
[Message 21] Alex: Which one?
[Message 22] Jamie: ""Housewives of Flint"". Don’t judge.
[Message 23] Alex: No judgement here. So, you’re good then, right?
[Message 24] Jamie: Yeah, I'm clear. Just shaken up about River.
[Message 25] Alex: Me too.
[Message 26] Kai: Hey Alex, you heard anything new?
[Message 27] Alex: About River? Just that the cops are still investigating.
[Message 28] Kai: They haven't contacted me yet.
[Message 29] Alex: Maybe they don’t think you were involved.
[Message 30] Kai: Hope so. This whole thing is crazy.
[Message 31] Alex: Yeah, it is. You at Nightclub that night?
[Message 32] Kai: Yeah, I was. Left around Late Evening. Saw River dealing.
[Message 33] Alex: Did you talk to River?
[Message 34] Kai: Briefly. Just a quick hello.
[Message 35] Alex: Anything seem off?
[Message 36] Kai: No, River seemed normal. You know, as normal as River gets.
[Message 37] Alex: Right.
[Message 38] Kai: I always thought River was trying to get rich quick.
[Message 39] Alex: Maybe someone got tired of River’s hustle.
[Message 40] Kai: Could be. The city is full of them.
[Message 41] Alex: You got any enemies, Kai?
[Message 42] Kai: Who doesn't? But nothing serious enough to get me involved in murder.
[Message 43] Alex: Good point.
[Message 44] Kai: I'm just trying to lay low until this blows over.
[Message 45] Alex: Smart move.
[Message 46] Kai: This could be a great opportunity for a political assassination.
[Message 47] Alex: What do you mean?
[Message 48] Kai: Nothing. Forget I said anything.
[Message 49] Alex: Okay…
[Message 50] Sarah: Hey Jamie, you okay? You seemed quiet earlier.
[Message 51] Jamie: Just thinking about River. It’s awful.
[Message 52] Sarah: I know. I heard about it.
[Message 53] Jamie: I can’t believe someone would do that.
[Message 54] Sarah: Me neither. Was River messing with the wrong people?
[Message 55] Jamie: Probably. It's a shame, though. River was so optimistic.
[Message 56] Sarah: Yeah, I remember.
[Message 57] Jamie: Did you know River well?
[Message 58] Sarah: Not really. Just saw River around.
[Message 59] Jamie: I heard Kai and River didn't get along.
[Message 60] Sarah: Really? Why not?
[Message 61] Jamie: Something about River owing Kai money.
[Message 62] Sarah: That could be a motive. But Kai is kinda scary too.
[Message 63] Jamie: I agree.
[Message 64] Sarah: You think Kai did it?
[Message 65] Jamie: I don’t know what to think.
[Message 66] Sarah: Just stay safe.
[Message 67] Jamie: You too.
[Message 68] Detective Miller: Mr. Kai, can you come down to the station?
[Message 69] Kai: What for?
[Message 70] Detective Miller: We have some questions about the River situation.
[Message 71] Kai: Do I need a lawyer?
[Message 72] Detective Miller: That’s up to you. But we'd appreciate your cooperation.
[Message 73] Kai: Fine. When?
[Message 74] Detective Miller: As soon as possible.
[Message 75] Kai: Okay, I'll be there in an hour.
[Message 76] Alex: You alright, Kai? I saw a detective message you.
[Message 77] Kai: Yeah, they want to talk to me about River.
[Message 78] Alex: You lawyering up?
[Message 79] Kai: Nah, I got nothing to hide.
[Message 80] Alex: That’s the spirit. Just tell them the truth.
[Message 81] Kai: Exactly. I told you, I left Nightclub at Late Evening.
[Message 82] Alex: That's right.
[Message 83] Kai: This is so stupid. I inherited money, and that’s the life.
[Message 84] Alex: It’ll be over soon.
[Message 85] Kai: Hope so.
[Message 86] Jamie: Hey Sarah, you won't believe this.
[Message 87] Sarah: What? Spill.
[Message 88] Jamie: I saw Kai buying a hammer at the hardware store yesterday.
[Message 89] Sarah: A hammer? Seriously?
[Message 90] Jamie: Yeah! And I remember Kai was saying ""I really hated River"".
[Message 91] Sarah: That's… concerning.
[Message 92] Jamie: I know, right?
[Message 93] Sarah: Did you tell the police?
[Message 94] Jamie: No, not yet. Should I?
[Message 95] Sarah: Definitely. That’s important information.
[Message 96] Jamie: Okay, I will. I just don't want to get involved.
[Message 97] Sarah: You’re doing the right thing. It might help catch the killer.
[Message 98] Jamie: I guess so.
[Message 99] Sarah: It's scary, I know.
[Message 100] Jamie: Very. I hope they don't get the death penalty, if they did it.
[Message 101] Detective Miller: Ms. Jamie, we'd like to ask you some questions.
[Message 102] Jamie: About River?
[Message 103] Detective Miller: Yes. Can you come down to the station?
[Message 104] Jamie: Sure.
[Message 105] Detective Miller: Great. See you soon.
[Message 106] Jamie: What if they think I did it?
[Message 107] Sarah: Just tell them the truth. You were at home watching TV, right?
[Message 108] Jamie: Yeah, but what if they don't believe me?
[Message 109] Sarah: They will. You have nothing to worry about.
[Message 110] Jamie: Okay.
[Message 111] Sarah: Let me know how it goes.
[Message 112] Jamie: Will do. Thanks, Sarah.
[Message 113] Alex: Hear anything from Kai?
[Message 114] Jamie: No, but the cops called me in too.
[Message 115] Alex: Really? What did they ask?
[Message 116] Jamie: Just about River and if I knew anything.
[Message 117] Alex: Did you tell them about Kai buying the hammer?
[Message 118] Jamie: Yep. And I mentioned River probably did something to deserve it.
[Message 119] Alex: Good.
[Message 120] Jamie: I hope they catch the person who did this.
[Message 121] Alex: Me too.
[Message 122] Kai: They are checking store security cameras.
[Message 123] Alex: Checking what now?
[Message 124] Kai: They said they know someone saw me leave the building.
[Message 125] Alex: So? You did leave the building.
[Message 126] Kai: But I didn't do anything!
[Message 127] Alex: Just tell them what happened and when. They will believe that you left at Late Evening.
[Message 128] Kai: I did go to the store to buy some candy
[Message 129] Alex: That's all you have to say.
[Message 130] Jamie: They seemed to think Kai knew about the murder ahead of time.
[Message 131] Sarah: Really? What makes them think that?
[Message 132] Jamie: They didn't say, but they kept asking if Kai had mentioned anything weird.
[Message 133] Sarah: That's suspicious.
[Message 134] Jamie: I know. It feels like they're trying to build a case.
[Message 135] Sarah: Well, just stick to the truth.
[Message 136] Jamie: I am. I told them Kai left Nightclub right before the murder happened.
[Message 137] Sarah: Just be careful, okay?
[Message 138] Jamie: Will do.
[Message 139] Alex: So, what happens now?
[Message 140] Kai: I don't know. They didn't arrest me, but they're not letting me leave town either.
[Message 141] Alex: That sucks.
[Message 142] Kai: I'm starting to think I need a lawyer.
[Message 143] Alex: Probably a good idea.
[Message 144] Kai: This whole thing is a nightmare.
[Message 145] Alex: Just hang in there.
[Message 146] Kai: Easier said than done.
[Message 147] Alex: You’ll get through it.
[Message 148] Kai: Thanks, Alex.
[Message 149] Jamie: I heard they're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 150] Sarah: Yeah, that's what they do with murder cases.
[Message 151] Jamie: Hopefully, they can prove that Kai is guilty.
[Message 152] Sarah: Justice needs to be served.
[Message 153] Jamie: Absolutely.
[Message 154] Alex: Hey Jamie, you alright after all that?
[Message 155] Jamie: Yeah, I'm okay. Glad it's over.

[Message 6] PRIYA: Poisoned! Who would do that?
[Message 7] NOAH: Sickos, that's who. Anyway, anyone seen my Buffalo Bills hat?

[Message 16] JESS: It's not an excuse! It's the truth! I get my coffee there every morning before my shift.

[Message 19] JESS: No, I didn’t see Sarah. I saw Mark. He looked upset.
[Message 20] NOAH: Mark? Why would he be upset? He was always complaining about her.
[Message 21] PRIYA: Maybe he finally did something about it. He always hated Sarah.
[Message 22] MARK: Whoa, hold on. What are you guys implying?
[Message 23] CHLOE: Nothing, Mark. Just…coincidences.
[Message 24] MARK: I was just at the Rest Area to…uh…clear my head.
[Message 25] SAM: At Dawn? Same time as the murder?
[Message 26] MARK: Yeah, well, I’m an early riser! Is that a crime now?
[Message 27] JESS: He always said he wished she would just disappear.
[Message 28] PRIYA: Seriously, Jess? That’s a pretty serious accusation.
[Message 29] JESS: It’s true! He said it all the time. After she fired him for stealing.
[Message 30] MARK: That’s a lie! She never fired me!
[Message 31] CHLOE: Did she fire you, Mark?
[Message 32] MARK: No! I quit! It was a toxic work environment.
[Message 33] SAM: But you were mad about it, right?
[Message 34] MARK: Maybe a little. But I wouldn't hurt anyone.
[Message 35] NOAH: Guys, this is getting nowhere. The cops will figure it out.
[Message 36] PRIYA: I hope so. Sarah didn’t deserve this.

[Message 40] PRIYA: No, why? You planning something, Jess?

[Message 55] MARK: Oh, right. You were there. Barely saw you.
[Message 56] CHLOE: This is exhausting. Let’s just let the police handle it.
[Message 57] SAM: I don't know, Chloe. Something feels off.
[Message 58] NOAH: Maybe you're just being paranoid, Sam.
[Message 59] PRIYA: Sam's a pretty good judge of character, Noah.
[Message 60] JESS: Did anyone know if Sarah had any enemies?
[Message 61] MARK: Besides me? Kidding!
[Message 62] CHLOE: I think she might have been clashing with someone about new security protocols.
[Message 63] SAM: Who? Do you know who?
[Message 64] CHLOE: Just heard her mention it in passing. Didn't catch the name.
[Message 65] NOAH: Guys, can we talk about something else? This is giving me a headache.
[Message 66] PRIYA: Sorry, Noah. It’s just hard to think about anything else.
[Message 67] JESS: I know. I keep thinking about her family.

[Message 71] NOAH: Well, maybe someone will come forward with something useful.
[Message 72] PRIYA: I hope so.

[Message 84] PRIYA: I mean, does anyone have any secrets they're not telling us?
[Message 85] CHLOE: Priya, seriously?
[Message 86] PRIYA: I’m just asking. Sarah was a friend and she deserves justice.
[Message 87] SAM: I agree, but that doesn't mean we accuse each other.
[Message 88] CHLOE: Maybe Mark had a legit reason to be mad.
[Message 89] SAM: Or maybe Jess knew Sarah was going to be there at Dawn.
[Message 90] PRIYA: Maybe Noah knows something he’s not letting on. He hates the police.
[Message 91] CHLOE: Ok, Priya, you're crossing a line.
[Message 92] SAM: Yeah, dial it back.
[Message 93] PRIYA: Sorry, sorry. Just…frustrated.
[Message 94] CHLOE: Me too.
[Message 95] SAM: Me too.
[Message 96] PRIYA: Did anyone see Mark talking to Jess last week? I swear I did.
[Message 97] CHLOE: Now, that's interesting. Mark hates Jess, he makes it known.
[Message 98] SAM: Talking about what?
[Message 99] PRIYA: I couldn’t hear. It looked intense though. Like they were planning something.
[Message 100] CHLOE: Maybe they were planning a surprise party for Sarah.
[Message 101] SAM: Don't be absurd.
[Message 102] PRIYA: Whatever. Just saying what I saw.
[Message 103] CHLOE: I'm going to try and get some sleep. This is draining.
[Message 104] SAM: Me too. Night.
[Message 105] PRIYA: Night.

[Message 106] JESS: (To Mark, private) Did you tell them about us talking?
[Message 107] MARK: (To Jess, private) No! Why would I? I stuck to the story. Did YOU?
[Message 108] JESS: (To Mark, private) Of course not! But Priya said she saw us!
[Message 109] MARK: (To Jess, private) She's lying. Or mistaken. Relax.
[Message 110] JESS: (To Mark, private) Easy for you to say. They're looking at me because of the rat Poisoning via ingestion.
[Message 111] MARK: (To Jess, private) Just stick to the story about the rodents. It'll be fine. Remember what we talked about, they'll get the death penalty for this.
[Message 112] JESS: (To Mark, private) If they find out it was us! What if they do?
[Message 113] MARK: (To Jess, private) They won't. We were careful. And you did get rid of her, right? She couldn't call 911 after?
[Message 114] JESS: (To Mark, private) Yes! Of course! But...are you sure about this?
[Message 115] MARK: (To Jess, private) Positive. Sarah intended to ruin me. I’m just evening the score.

[Message 116] NOAH: (To Priya, private) You really think I know something?
[Message 117] PRIYA: (To Noah, private) I don't know, Noah. You're always so quick to defend people.
[Message 118] NOAH: (To Priya, private) Someone has to. The cops will find someone to blame to justify firing her. It's just my nature.
[Message 119] PRIYA: (To Noah, private) Just be honest with me. Did you see anything? Hear anything?
[Message 120] NOAH: (To Priya, private) I saw Jess buying Poisoning via ingestion. But she said it was for rats.
[Message 121] PRIYA: (To Noah, private) You believe her?
[Message 122] NOAH: (To Priya, private) I don't know what to believe anymore.
[Message 123] PRIYA: (To Noah, private) Just be careful, Noah.
[Message 124] NOAH: (To Priya, private) You too, Priya.

[Message 125] SAM: (To Chloe, private) I can't shake the feeling that Mark and Jess are in this together.
[Message 126] CHLOE: (To Sam, private) I know. It's weird, right?
[Message 127] SAM: (To Chloe, private) Did Sarah ever mention anything about Mark blackmailing her?
[Message 128] CHLOE: (To Sam, private) No, why?
[Message 129] SAM: (To Chloe, private) Just a hunch. He's always seemed like he had something to hide.
[Message 130] CHLOE: (To Sam, private) Maybe. But Jess is shady too.
[Message 131] SAM: (To Chloe, private) They both are. We need to be careful.
[Message 132] CHLOE: (To Sam, private) Agreed. This is getting dangerous.

[Message 133] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Hey, did anyone hear back from the police?
[Message 134] SAM: (Group Chat) Not yet.
[Message 135] PRIYA: (Group Chat) Nothing here either.
[Message 136] NOAH: (Group Chat) Cops are useless anyway.
[Message 137] JESS: (Group Chat) Still thinking of Sarah.
[Message 138] MARK: (Group Chat) Me too. A real tragedy.
[Message 139] CHLOE: (Group Chat) We should all try to remember the good times with her.
[Message 140] SAM: (Group Chat) That's a good idea, Chloe.

...","[Message 1] Kai: Hey Liam, you heading to the memorial for Sarah tomorrow?
[Message 2] Liam: Hey Kai, yeah, I wouldn't miss it. Horrible what happened.
[Message 3] Kai: Absolutely. Still can't believe it. Did you know her well?
[Message 4] Liam: We talked sometimes, you know, work stuff. She was always ambitious.
[Message 5] Ben: Hey guys, saw the news. Crazy about Sarah. I’m in shock.
[Message 6] Kai: Hey Ben. Yeah, it's awful. They still haven't caught anyone, right?
[Message 7] Ben: Not that I know of. Cops were asking questions at my place all day.
[Message 8] Liam: Questions about what, Ben?
[Message 9] Ben: Just the usual, where was I, did I see anything, blah blah blah.
[Message 10] Kai: Weird. They didn't talk to me yet.
[Message 11] Liam: Me neither. Maybe they're focusing on people who worked closer to Sarah's office.
[Message 12] Ben: Could be. Anyway, gotta run. Catch you guys tomorrow?
[Message 13] Kai: Yep, see you then.
[Message 14] Liam: Later.

[Message 15] Jake: Yo, Marco, you hear about Sarah?
[Message 16] Marco: Yeah, man, messed up. You think they'll find who did it?
[Message 17] Jake: Hope so. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 18] Marco: Seriously. I saw Kyle arguing with her last week, pretty intense.
[Message 19] Jake: Kyle? What were they arguing about?
[Message 20] Marco: Something about Kyle's performance. She was riding him hard.
[Message 21] Jake: Damn. That's...interesting.

[Message 22] Kai: Liam, you think it was a random thing, or someone she knew?
[Message 23] Liam: Honestly, Kai, I have no idea. It's Fayetteville, could be anything.
[Message 24] Kai: True. Still, feels personal, you know?
[Message 25] Liam: Yeah, I get it. The manager rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.
[Message 26] Kai: She did. But murder? That's another level.

[Message 27] Marco: Jake, you still at that church group thing?
[Message 28] Jake: Yeah, almost done. Why?
[Message 29] Marco: Just wondering. You were pretty vocal about your beliefs lately.
[Message 30] Jake: What's that supposed to mean?
[Message 31] Marco: Nothing, man. Just saying.
[Message 32] Jake: Whatever.

[Message 33] Kai: Hey Ben, you seemed stressed yesterday. Everything alright?
[Message 34] Ben: Yeah, Kai, just work stuff. You know how it is.
[Message 35] Kai: Sure. Just checking.

[Message 36] Liam: Anyone know if Sarah had any enemies? Like, *real* enemies?
[Message 37] Marco: She got into it with Kyle. Like Jake said.
[Message 38] Kai: You heard about that too? Small world.
[Message 39] Liam: Office gossip travels fast. But enemies, plural? Anyone else?

[Message 40] Jake: Marco, stop being cryptic. If you have something to say, say it.
[Message 41] Marco: I'm just saying, you seemed pretty anti-Sarah before...you knew her being transgender, right?
[Message 42] Jake: That's low, Marco. Seriously low. My faith is about love, not hate.
[Message 43] Marco: Okay, okay, chill. Just asking a question.
[Message 44] Liam: Guys, can we not? This isn't helping anyone.

[Message 45] Ben: I heard she wanted to get rid of him. Something about HR violation?
[Message 46] Kai: Get rid of who, Ben?
[Message 47] Ben: Doesn't matter. Just heard it from someone. Gossip.
[Message 48] Liam: Gossip is dangerous right now, Ben. Be careful what you spread.

[Message 49] Marco: Jake, if you saw him leave the building at Late Evening, it would look bad.
[Message 50] Jake: Dude, I was at church! I have witnesses!
[Message 51] Marco: Relax, man. Just saying...

[Message 52] Kai: This whole thing is making me paranoid.
[Message 53] Liam: Me too. Feels like everyone's a suspect.
[Message 54] Ben: Especially with how the cops are acting.

[Message 55] Jake: I am not involved. I'm innocent.
[Message 56] Marco: Nobody said you were involved, Jake. Chill.
[Message 57] Jake: It feels like you're implying it.

[Message 58] Liam: Did anyone see anything unusual that night? Anything at all?
[Message 59] Kai: I was at home. Movie night with my wife.
[Message 60] Ben: I was out to dinner with my family.
[Message 61] Liam: Alright, just checking.
[Message 62] Jake: Marco, where were you?
[Message 63] Marco: I went to go see my brother in a nearby town.

[Message 64] Kai: They found Strangulation with a rope at the scene. Awful.
[Message 65] Liam: Jesus. That's brutal.
[Message 66] Ben: Details are getting leaked already?

[Message 67] Marco: Jake, you're pretty handy. Ever look up how to make Strangulation with a rope online?
[Message 68] Jake: What the hell, Marco! Why would you even ask that?!
[Message 69] Marco: Just a hypothetical. Relax.
[Message 70] Liam: Marco, knock it off.

[Message 71] Ben: My neighbor said she saw someone buying Strangulation with a rope at the store that day, but couldn't describe them.
[Message 72] Kai: Ugh, this is getting worse and worse.

[Message 73] Jake: Marco, I swear to God, if you don't stop...
[Message 74] Marco: What? You gonna strangle me with a rope, Jake? See, I'm just kidding!
[Message 75] Liam: Marco, stop fueling the fire!

[Message 76] Kai: I'm going to take a break from this conversation. It's stressing me out too much.
[Message 77] Liam: Good idea, Kai. Me too.
[Message 78] Ben: Agreed.

[Message 79] Marco: Okay, okay, I'll stop. Just saying, someone wanted her gone.
[Message 80] Jake: Who, Marco? Who wanted her gone?
[Message 81] Marco: Doesn't matter now, does it? She's already gone.

[Message 82] Liam: Ben, you said Sarah wanted to ""get rid of"" someone. Who was it and why?
[Message 83] Ben: It was Kyle. The guy she fired. She told me he needed to go and told me to prepare paperwork. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 84] Liam: This is important, Ben. You need to tell the police this.

[Message 85] Marco: Maybe if you called 911 when you found her, she would still be alive.
[Message 86] Jake: I wasn't even there!
[Message 87] Marco: I was talking about Liam. He found her.
[Message 88] Liam: What? I found her the next morning! I called 911 immediately! What are you implying?
[Message 89] Marco: That's what *you* say.

[Message 90] Ben: Liam, did she seem okay when you saw her last?
[Message 91] Liam: I saw her a few days before. She was stressed, but nothing out of the ordinary.
[Message 92] Ben: She didn't mention any threats or anything?
[Message 93] Liam: No.
[Message 94] Kai: Guys stop it.

[Message 95] Jake: I’m going to pray for Sarah's soul. And for justice.
[Message 96] Marco: You do that, Jake.

[Message 97] Ben: I am going to make funeral arangements.
[Message 98] Liam: Okay, that's good, Ben. Thanks.

[Message 99] Marco: He always hated Sarah. He talked about it all the time.
[Message 100] Jake: Who hated her, Marco? You need to be specific.
[Message 101] Marco: Doesn't matter.
[Message 102] Liam: Yes, it does matter! Tell us!

[Message 103] Ben: Marco, stop playing games. You’re scaring everyone.
[Message 104] Marco: Okay, okay. It was Kyle. He always complained about her.

[Message 105] Jake: He's just trying to stir up trouble. Don't listen to him.
[Message 106] Marco: I'm just saying what I heard. He said he wanted to get rid of her.

[Message 107] Liam: This isn't helping, guys. We need to focus on finding the truth, not spreading rumors.
[Message 108] Kai: I agree.

[Message 109] Ben: Maybe we should all just talk to the police separately.
[Message 110] Liam: That's probably the best idea, Ben.
[Message 111] Kai: Yep.

[Message 112] Jake: I have nothing to hide. I’ll cooperate fully.
[Message 113] Marco: Sure, you will.
[Message 114] Jake: What's that supposed to mean?!

[Message 115] Ben: I am going to prepare the obituary.
[Message 116] Liam: Thank you, Ben.

[Message 117] Marco: They'll probably get the death penalty for this. It's Fayetteville, they don't mess around.
[Message 118] Jake: Marco, you're being morbid.
[Message 119] Marco: I'm just saying the truth.

[Message 120] Liam: I’m ending this chat. It’s going nowhere.
[Message 121] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 122] Ben: Same here.

[Message 123] Jake: I'm going offline. Pray for Sarah.
[Message 124] Marco: Bye, Jake.

[Message 125] Liam: Ben, keep me updated on the funeral arrangements.
[Message 126] Ben: Will do.

[Message 127] Marco: It was a politically motivated assassination. I just know it.
[Message 128] Marco: I told Jake and Liam that she was transgender and it got a reaction.
[Message 129] Kai: Hey Liam, you going to that concert next weekend? I got extra tickets
[Message 130] Liam: Hey Kai, Yeah I remember! Been looking forward to it.
[Message 131] Ben: Hey guys, going to sleep. The cops exhausted me.
[Message 132] Kai: Okay, Ben. Get some rest.

[Message 133] Liam: Maybe you should too, Marco.
[Message 134] Marco: Lol. Okay.
[Message 135] Liam: Hey Jake, let's go grab a bite after the memorial to get your mind off of things.
[Message 136] Jake: Cool with me, man.
[Message 137] Liam: Ben, get the details from the church group and let me know.

[Message 138] Marco: Hey! Don't talk about me behind my back.

[Message 139] Ben: Going to sleep.
[Message 140] Kai: Good night!
[Message 141] Jake: Good night!
[Message 142] Liam: Good night!
[Message 143] Marco: What an anticlimactic conversation.
[Message 144] Jake: Okay I need to run
[Message 145] Liam: Sure buddy.
[Message 146] Ben: Later
[Message 147] Kai: Ok.

[Message 148] Jake: Her shouting probably provoked him to violence
[Message 149] Marco: Good night yall I am going to sleep now fr this time.
[Message 150] Liam: Ben, I hope you are fine
[Message 151] Kai: Let's make sure we get together after memorial. It will be good for us.

[Message 152] Jake: Marco always has something to say to push peoples buttons.
[Message 153] Liam: Yea, true. But not all the time.
[Message 154] Ben: Ok.
[Message 155] Kai: Cool.

[Message 71] MAYA: Yeah, maybe. Everyone's a little on edge.

[Message 73] MAYA: No worries. Glad I could listen.

[Message 97] CHLOE: Sounds good. Where?
[Message 98] MAYA: How about that new place downtown? ""The Daily Grind?""
[Message 99] LIAM: Never been. Sounds good to me.
[Message 100] NOAH: I'm game.

[Message 110] LIAM: Yeah, just... thinking.
[Message 111] MAYA: About what?
[Message 112] LIAM: This whole case. It's just messed up. I was aware that Alex's job was dangerous.
[Message 113] MAYA: I know. It is.
[Message 114] LIAM: It's making me rethink a lot of things. The Daily Grind sounds like it will be fun though.
[Message 115] MAYA: Me too. We all need a break.
[Message 116] LIAM: True.
[Message 117] MAYA: Everything will be okay.

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, the news is everywhere. Awful about Riley.
[Message 3] Maya: I know! Poor Riley. I saw her just yesterday. What could have happened?
[Message 4] Liam: No idea. The news said something about violence.
[Message 5] Maya: I heard whispers of a golf club. Crazy.
[Message 6] Liam: A golf club? That's… intense. Who would do that?
[Message 7] Maya: That's what everyone is saying!! They're going away for a long time for this
[Message 8] Liam: So sad. I can't believe someone would hurt her so badly.
[Message 9] Maya: Me neither. Did you know Riley well?
[Message 10] Liam: Not really. Just knew her from the gallery. You?
[Message 11] Maya: Yeah, we were working on a project together. I'm supposed to meet her tomorrow.
[Message 12] Liam: Oh wow, that's gotta be rough.
[Message 13] Maya: Tell me about it. I'm so freaked out.
[Message 14] Liam: Maybe you should take some time off.
[Message 15] Maya: Maybe. Anyway, what are you up to today? Trying to distract myself.
[Message 16] Liam: Just working. Wish I could take the day off. This whole thing is making me uneasy.
[Message 17] Maya: I know, right? Anyway, let's talk about something else.
[Message 18] Liam: Agreed. Did you see that new exhibit downtown?
[Message 19] Maya: No, what's it like?
[Message 20] Liam: Some really cool sculptures, very modern.
[Message 21] Maya: Sounds interesting. Maybe we should go sometime.
[Message 22] Liam: Definitely! Let me know when you're free.
[Message 23] Maya: Will do! Hey, did you see Kai at the gallery last week?
[Message 24] Liam: I think so. They were looking at a painting, if I remember right.
[Message 25] Maya: Yeah, I saw them looking at Riley kinda intensely too. I’m just saying.
[Message 26] Liam: Really? Huh. I didn’t notice that.
[Message 27] Maya: I’m probably just overthinking it.
[Message 28] Liam: Probably. Don't let your mind run wild.
[Message 29] Kai: Hey, have either of you heard anything new about Riley?
[Message 30] Maya: Just what's on the news. Why?
[Message 31] Kai: Just… concerned. It's all so messed up. I knew Riley and wanted to know if the police found out anything.
[Message 32] Liam: Same here. Pretty shocking.
[Message 33] Maya: Yeah, the gallery feels so different now.
[Message 34] Kai: Tell me about it. I can't even think about going back there.
[Message 35] Liam: Me neither. Gives me the creeps.
[Message 36] Maya: Do you think they’ll find out who did it?
[Message 37] Kai: I hope so. Whoever did this needs to pay.
[Message 38] Liam: Agreed. What were you doing last night, Kai?
[Message 39] Kai: Just at home, watching TV. Why?
[Message 40] Liam: Just curious. Everyone's a suspect, right?
[Message 41] Kai: Seriously? You think I had something to do with it?
[Message 42] Maya: Liam! Don't be like that.
[Message 43] Liam: Sorry, sorry. Didn't mean it like that.
[Message 44] Kai: Whatever. I’m going to go do something productive.
[Message 45] Maya: Later, Kai.
[Message 46] Liam: See ya. Look, Maya, I just… I can't shake this feeling.
[Message 47] Maya: What feeling?
[Message 48] Liam: That something’s not right. Something's being hidden.
[Message 49] Maya: Well, duh. Of course something's being hidden. Someone committed a murder!
[Message 50] Liam: No, I mean… before that. Riley… she was acting weird lately.
[Message 51] Maya: Weird how?
[Message 52] Liam: On edge. Like she was expecting something bad to happen. She even started taking self-defense classes.
[Message 53] Maya: Seriously? She never mentioned anything to me.
[Message 54] Liam: Maybe she didn’t want to worry you.
[Message 55] Maya: Maybe. It just makes everything even sadder.
[Message 56] Liam: Yeah. Hey, remember that old golf club Riley kept in her office?
[Message 57] Maya: Yeah? What about it? It was so odd.
[Message 58] Liam: Just… wondering where it is now.
[Message 59] Maya: Oh god, you don’t think…?
[Message 60] Liam: I don’t know what to think anymore. I saw Kai leave the building at Midnight and that's when I went to bed.
[Message 61] Maya: That's awful. What about Alex? I saw them at the bar that night.
[Message 62] Liam: No idea. Haven’t talked to Alex.
[Message 63] Maya: Maybe we should talk to the police, Liam.
[Message 64] Liam: About what? Speculation? They’ll laugh us out of the station.
[Message 65] Maya: But what if we know something important?
[Message 66] Liam: Look, let the police do their job, okay?
[Message 67] Maya: Fine. But I still don't feel right about all this.
[Message 68] Liam: I know. Me neither.
[Message 69] Maya: I think Alex knew more than they were letting on.
[Message 70] Liam: What makes you say that?
[Message 71] Maya: The way they were talking about Riley last week. Almost like they were… jealous.
[Message 72] Liam: Jealous? Of what?
[Message 73] Maya: Her success, maybe? Or maybe Riley and Alex had a thing for each other and it didn’t work out.
[Message 74] Liam: Anything’s possible, I guess. It was an impulsive act of rage, maybe that means it wasnt planned.
[Message 75] Maya: Alex has anger issues, that's all I'm saying.
[Message 76] Liam: Okay, I hear you. But still, let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 77] Maya: I’m not, I'm just saying...
[Message 78] Liam: I know, I know. It's just… this whole thing is messed up.
[Message 79] Maya: Tell me about it. So, what are you doing for dinner?
[Message 80] Liam: Thinking about ordering pizza. Want to come over?
[Message 81] Maya: Sure, that sounds good. I need a distraction.
[Message 82] Liam: Great. Come around 7?
[Message 83] Maya: Perfect. See you then.
[Message 84] Liam: Later. Hey, one more thing.
[Message 85] Maya: Yeah?
[Message 86] Liam: Please don't mention any of this to anyone, okay? Not about Kai, not about Alex, not about the golf club.
[Message 87] Maya: Why not?
[Message 88] Liam: Just… trust me on this. It’s better if we keep it to ourselves.
[Message 89] Maya: Okay… if you say so.
[Message 90] Liam: Thanks. See you tonight.
[Message 91] Maya: See you.
[Message 92] Liam: You know, Riley always hated how much time Kai spent at the gallery.
[Message 93] Maya: Really? I never noticed.
[Message 94] Liam: Yeah. She said Kai was always lurking around, making her nervous. It was awful for Riley.
[Message 95] Maya: Wow. I had no idea. That's so sad.

[Message 11] Chris: ""Alex? Nah. Why?""

[Message 18] Sarah: ""Macrame? Now? That's a stretch, Chris. And she purposefully didn't say what it was for.""
[Message 19] David: ""Exactly! She got defensive when I asked.""
[Message 20] Chris: ""Okay, okay, I get it. It's suspicious.""
[Message 21] Sarah: ""Suspicious is an understatement.""
[Message 22] David: ""Well, I gotta go. Keep me updated if you hear anything.""
[Message 23] Chris: ""Will do.""
[Message 24] Sarah: ""Later.""
[Message 25] Chris: ""So, Sarah, you really think Alex is capable of something like this?""
[Message 26] Sarah: ""I don't *know*, Chris. But he hated Jordan. He always hated 4.  Journalist. And he's got that impulsive act of rage thing going on.""
[Message 27] Chris: ""Hate is a strong word. Plus that Alex has a scar above left eyebrow. Easy to identify.""
[Message 28] Sarah: ""True. But Alex also knew the manager at the clinic, Taylor. The law enforcement Officer. He mentioned something about her stubbornness before.""
[Message 29] Chris: ""Okay, that's definitely... something. Maybe we should tell the police?""
[Message 30] Sarah: ""Maybe. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need more information.""
[Message 31] Chris: ""Agreed. This is messed up.""
[Message 32] Sarah: ""Did you hear they think it happened late evening?""
[Message 33] Chris: ""Yeah. I was home all night. Watched a movie.""
[Message 34] Sarah: ""Lucky you. I was working late.""
[Message 35] Chris: ""What about Alex and Bailey?""
[Message 36] Sarah: ""I have no idea. I haven't spoken to Alex since Tuesday.""
[Message 37] Chris: ""And Bailey?""
[Message 38] Sarah: ""I saw Bailey yesterday, but we just exchanged pleasantries. Nothing about rope or anything.""
[Message 39] Chris: ""Right. Well, keep your ears open.""
[Message 40] Sarah: ""You too.""
[Message 41] David: ""Hey guys, new info. Apparently, Taylor, the LEO, was investigating some shady stuff at Alex's work.""
[Message 42] Chris: ""Whoa. That adds a whole new layer.""
[Message 43] Sarah: ""Seriously? What kind of shady stuff?""
[Message 44] David: ""I don't know the details, but it was something about embezzlement. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.""
[Message 45] Chris: ""So, motive for Alex to get rid of Taylor. Makes sense.""
[Message 46] Sarah: ""And maybe Jordan found out about it and Alex had to silence him too?""
[Message 47] David: ""Could be. The plot thickens.""
[Message 48] Chris: ""We should definitely tell the police this.""
[Message 49] Sarah: ""I'm on it.""
[Message 50] David: ""Good. Let's hope they catch the person responsible. They're going away for a long time for this.""

[Message 53] Bailey: ""Hey guys, what's all the chatter about?""
[Message 54] Chris: ""Just talking about the murders at the Vet Clinic. Crazy, right?""
[Message 55] Bailey: ""Yeah, awful. I can't believe it.""
[Message 56] Sarah: ""David mentioned you bought some rope recently, Bailey.""
[Message 57] Bailey: ""Oh, yeah. I'm starting a new weaving project. It's none of your business, Sarah. Why do you have to be so nosy?""
[Message 58] Chris: ""Just curious, Bailey. No need to get defensive.""
[Message 59] Bailey: ""I'm not defensive. I just don't appreciate being interrogated.""
[Message 60] David: ""Chill out, Bailey. No one's interrogating you.""
[Message 61] Bailey: ""Easy for you to say, David. You're not the one being put on the spot.""
[Message 62] Sarah: ""Okay, let's just drop it. Bailey, did you know either of the victims?""
[Message 63] Bailey: ""I knew Taylor vaguely. We ran into each other at a coffee shop sometimes. He was always really nice.""
[Message 64] Chris: ""Did you know Jordan?""
[Message 65] Bailey: ""No, never heard of him.""
[Message 66] Sarah: ""Alright. Thanks, Bailey.""
[Message 67] Bailey: ""Sure. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a weaving project to get back to.""
[Message 68] Chris: ""Alright, bye.""
[Message 69] Sarah: ""Later.""
[Message 70] David: ""See ya.""
[Message 71] Chris: ""Bailey is acting really strange. Definitely something there.""
[Message 72] Sarah: ""I agree. The defensiveness is a red flag.""
[Message 73] David: ""Maybe she's just nervous because of the rope thing.""
[Message 74] Chris: ""Maybe. But I don't buy it.""
[Message 75] Sarah: ""Me neither. I'm going to look into Bailey's background a bit more.""
[Message 76] Chris: ""Good idea. I'll see if I can find anything else about Alex and Taylor.""
[Message 77] David: ""Okay, team effort. Let's crack this case.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""Hey guys, what's up?""
[Message 79] Chris: ""Hey Alex. Just talking about the Vet Clinic murders. Rough stuff.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Yeah, terrible. I can't believe it.""
[Message 81] Sarah: ""Alex, did you know Taylor well?""
[Message 82] Alex: ""I knew her, yeah. She used to work at my company. But I thought it was a bit harsh when I fired her.""
[Message 83] Chris: ""What was she like?""
[Message 84] Alex: ""She was okay. Really stubborn. Always butting heads with management.""
[Message 85] David: ""Did you have any issues with Jordan, the journalist?""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Jordan? Nah, never met him. Why?""
[Message 87] Sarah: ""Just curious. You seemed pretty upset about something last week.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""I was stressed about work. Deadline, that's all.""
[Message 89] Chris: ""Right. Well, hope you're doing okay.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""Yeah, I'm fine. Just trying to process everything. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""

[Message 92] Sarah: ""Agreed. Well, gotta run. Talk later.""
[Message 93] Chris: ""Later.""
[Message 94] David: ""Bye.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""See ya.""
[Message 96] Chris: ""Alex seems genuinely shocked. I'm starting to doubt he had anything to do with it.""
[Message 97] Sarah: ""Maybe. But he's a good actor. And he was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""
[Message 98] David: ""True. This is so confusing.""
[Message 99] Chris: ""We need more concrete evidence.""
[Message 100] Sarah: ""I agree. I'm going to check social media. See if anyone posted anything suspicious around the time of the murders.""
[Message 101] Chris: ""Good idea. I'll look into Alex's alibi for late evening.""
[Message 102] David: ""I'll try to find out more about Bailey's rope project.""
[Message 103] Sarah: ""Teamwork makes the dream work.""
[Message 104] Chris: ""Let's hope so.""
[Message 105] David: ""Fingers crossed.""
[Message 106] Sarah: ""Guys, I found something. A tweet from Bailey saying, ""Time to tie up loose ends."" Posted right before the murders.""
[Message 107] Chris: ""Holy crap. That's pretty damning.""
[Message 108] David: ""Wow. Okay, Bailey is definitely looking like the prime suspect now.""
[Message 109] Sarah: ""I think we need to go to the police with this ASAP.""
[Message 110] Chris: ""Agreed. This is beyond our pay grade now.""
[Message 111] David: ""I'm already calling them.""
[Message 112] Sarah: ""Good. Let's hope they can catch her.""
[Message 113] Chris: ""Let's hope so. This has been a nightmare.""
[Message 114] Sarah: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 115] David: ""Police are on their way to Bailey's house. They said thanks for the tip.""
[Message 116] Chris: ""Awesome. Finally, some progress.""
[Message 117] Sarah: ""I feel a little bad for Bailey, but... two people are dead.""
[Message 118] Chris: ""Yeah, it's a tragic situation all around.""
[Message 119] David: ""Well, at least we did our part to help bring her to justice.""
[Message 120] Sarah: ""True. Hopefully, this will bring some closure to the families of the victims.""
[Message 121] Chris: ""Amen to that.""
[Message 122] David: ""Definitely.""
[Message 123] Alex: ""Hey, any news on the Vet Clinic case? I'm really shaken up about it.""
[Message 124] Chris: ""They're looking into Bailey. She posted something suspicious online.""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Bailey? Wow. I never would have suspected her.""
[Message 126] Sarah: ""Yeah, it's crazy. You never know who's capable of what.""
[Message 127] Alex: ""True. This whole thing is just... unsettling.""
[Message 128] David: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 129] Chris: ""Well, hopefully, they'll get to the bottom of it soon.""
[Message 130] Alex: ""Yeah. Thanks for keeping me in the loop.""
[Message 131] Sarah: ""No problem, Alex.""
[Message 132] Chris: ""Anytime.""
[Message 133] David: ""Take care.""
[Message 134] Alex: ""You too.""
[Message 135] Sarah: ""So, do we think they got the right person?""
[Message 136] Chris: ""It seems like a pretty open-and-shut case with that tweet.""
[Message 137] David: ""Yeah, I think so. Unless there's some major twist we don't know about.""
[Message 138] Sarah: ""Hopefully not. I'm ready for this whole thing to be over.""
[Message 139] Chris: ""Me too. Let's just hope justice is served.""
[Message 140] David: ""Agreed. Time to move on, I guess.""

...","[Message 1] Liam: Hey Maya, you okay? Heard about what happened down at Cemetery.

[Message 2] Maya: Hey Liam, yeah, shaken up. Two people… it's awful. You knew Dana, right?

[Message 3] Liam: Yeah, Dana was my taxi driver last week. Crazy. What about you, know anyone?

[Message 4] Maya: I knew the manager from cemetery. Small world. Anyway, are you free for that coffee tomorrow?

[Message 5] Liam: Yeah, coffee sounds good. Need a distraction. This whole thing is messed up.

[Message 6] Sarah: Hey guys, heard the news. So horrible! Poor Dana...

[Message 7] Maya: Sarah, you doing okay? You lived closer to the cemetery, didn’t you?

[Message 8] Sarah: I did. Heard sirens late at night but didn't think much of it. Now I'm regretting not calling it in. 😔

[Message 9] Liam: You couldn't have known, Sarah. Don't blame yourself. It was at Dusk, hard to see anything.

[Message 10] Sarah: Still… what if I could have helped?

[Message 11] Maya: There’s no way you could have known, Sarah.

[Message 12] Liam: Exactly, Maya's right. What are you doing tonight?

[Message 13] Sarah: Staying in, watching a movie. Need to take my mind off things.

[Message 14] Liam: Good idea. Something light, comedy maybe?

[Message 15] Sarah: Yeah, definitely something funny.

[Message 16] Maya: Just saw the news report, they are saying it was Arson by setting a fire.

[Message 17] Liam: Arson by setting a fire?! That’s insane.

[Message 18] Sarah: Oh my god... that's even worse.

[Message 19] Maya: I know, right? Makes it so much more… deliberate. I'm trying to remember, did anyone have a grudge against cemetery?

[Message 20] Liam: Not that I know of. Everyone seemed to like the manager.

[Message 21] Sarah: Dana, on the other hand, was always complaining about something.

[Message 22] Maya: Right. She was cynical, always saying the world was against her.

[Message 23] Liam: Yeah, Dana always seemed stressed. I asked her to drive faster, she looked at me and said I should stop asking her to do that, she will do at her own pace.

[Message 24] Sarah: I remember seeing her argue with someone near the coffee shop downtown last week.

[Message 25] Maya: Who was she arguing with, Sarah?

[Message 26] Sarah: Didn't get a good look, just saw two people yelling.

[Message 27] Liam: Crap, wish you'd gotten more info.

[Message 28] Maya: Maybe it's nothing. People argue all the time. I was buying Arson by setting a fire last week at the store, I hope I am not under investigation now.

[Message 29] Liam: Arson by setting a fire?! Why did you buy that?

[Message 30] Sarah: Maya, that is suspicious! Why?

[Message 31] Maya: Relax, guys. It was for a bonfire at my friend's place next month.

[Message 32] Liam: Oh. Okay. Still, maybe don’t mention that to the police.

[Message 33] Sarah: Good advice, Liam.

[Message 34] Maya: Yeah, probably smart. Thanks.

[Message 35] Liam: Anyway, back to the case… anything else stand out to anyone?

[Message 36] Sarah: I saw someone leave the building at Dusk, but I couldn't tell who it was. It was too dark.

[Message 37] Maya: Dusk is the worst time. Not quite day, not quite night.

[Message 38] Liam: That sucks, Sarah. It could've been helpful.

[Message 39] Sarah: I know! I feel terrible.

[Message 40] Maya: Dont beat yourself up. It’s not your fault. I know this is weird, but has anyone been contacted by the police yet?

[Message 41] Liam: Nope, not me.

[Message 42] Sarah: Me neither.

[Message 43] Maya: Okay, just checking. I’m going to try and get some sleep. This whole thing is giving me a headache.

[Message 44] Liam: Goodnight, Maya. Sleep well.

[Message 45] Sarah: Goodnight guys.

[Message 46] Liam: (Next day) Hey Sarah, Maya, coffee still on for tomorrow?

[Message 47] Sarah: Yeah, I'm in. Need to get out of the house.

[Message 48] Maya: I'm still good for coffee.

[Message 49] Liam: Cool. This case is going to haunt me for a while. What were those two people doing in a cemetery at Dusk anyway?

[Message 50] Sarah: Good question.

[Message 51] Maya: Maybe they were meeting someone? Or visiting a grave?

[Message 52] Liam: Visiting a grave at Dusk? Seems a bit morbid.

[Message 53] Sarah: Maybe it was something illicit? You know, like a secret rendezvous.

[Message 54] Maya: Maybe. Or maybe it was something completely innocent and they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

[Message 55] Liam: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened. The manager should have hired someone else.

[Message 56] Sarah: What do you mean, Liam?

[Message 57] Liam: Nothing. Just thinking out loud. I knew the manager had fired Dana from a client some weeks ago.

[Message 58] Maya: Oh, that's right! I forgot about that. Dana was furious when it happened.

[Message 59] Sarah: Wow, I didn't know that. That could be a motive for someone, right?

[Message 60] Liam: I don't know. Seems like a stretch.

[Message 61] Maya: Maybe Dana purposefully wanted to hurt the manager for revenge?

[Message 62] Sarah: That's dark, Maya.

[Message 63] Liam: Yeah, but it's possible. People do crazy things when they're angry.

[Message 64] Maya: True. Hope they don't get the death penalty for this.

[Message 65] Sarah: Absolutely. That's too cruel.

[Message 66] Liam: I think it’s only fair if they are punished severely.

[Message 67] Sarah: Well, Arson by setting a fire is a serious crime, so they're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 68] Maya: Definitely. Anyway, I gotta run. Talk to you guys tomorrow at coffee?

[Message 69] Liam: Yep, see you then.

[Message 70] Sarah: Bye guys.

[Message 71] (Next day, at coffee) Liam: So, anything new happen overnight?

[Message 72] Maya: Nope. Just a terrible nightmare about Cemetery.

[Message 73] Sarah: Same here. I kept seeing flames. It was awful.

[Message 74] Liam: I dreamt about Dana. She was driving me somewhere, but I couldn't see where.

[Message 75] Maya: Spooky.

[Message 76] Sarah: Very.

[Message 77] Liam: I feel like we're missing something important. Something we’re overlooking.

[Message 78] Maya: I agree. But what?

[Message 79] Sarah: Maybe we should try to piece together everything we know. All the little details.

[Message 80] Liam: Good idea. Okay, so Dana was fired, she argued with someone, and someone left the building at Dusk.

[Message 81] Maya: And I bought Arson by setting a fire for a bonfire.

[Message 82] Sarah: Maya, are you sure you didn't see anyone suspicious when you bought it?

[Message 83] Maya: No, I didn't. It was crowded.

[Message 84] Liam: The police have been asking around. Did you get a call?

[Message 85] Sarah: They called this morning. Asked me about what I saw at Dusk.

[Message 86] Maya: Seriously? They haven't called me yet.

[Message 87] Liam: Maybe they're just working their way through the list.

[Message 88] Sarah: Or maybe they already know something.

[Message 89] Maya: That's a little unnerving.

[Message 90] Liam: Let's just try to stay calm and cooperate. The truth will come out eventually. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there, that's all I am going to say.

[Message 34] Ashley: ""No idea. She's been MIA lately.""
[Message 35] Brenda: ""Kim? Oh, she's been really into that weird spiritual stuff. I heard she was buying Blunt force trauma with a hammer at the store last week too. Though I don't think she would hurt anyone.""
[Message 36] Carlos: ""Spiritual stuff, huh? Like what?""
[Message 37] Brenda: ""I don't know, cult-like rituals and stuff. Real weird.""

[Message 81] Brenda: ""Carlos! Seriously? Why didn't you tell the cops that?!""
[Message 82] Ashley: ""Unbelievable! You knew all along!""
[Message 83] Carlos: ""I didn't *know*! I thought he was kidding! It's Ben!""

[Message 90] Brenda: ""Ashley, calm down. Let's all calm down.""
[Message 91] Ashley: ""No! I'm done being calm! This is insane!""
[Message 92] Carlos: ""Look, maybe it wasn't Ben. Maybe someone else did it.""
[Message 93] Brenda: ""Like who, Carlos? Kim, with her 'cult rituals'?""
[Message 94] Ashley: ""Or maybe you, Carlos? You were the last one to see 5.  Corrections Officer yesterday, you were buying lottery tickets, and you knew about the hammer!""
[Message 95] Carlos: ""Whoa, Ashley! That's messed up! I'm not a murderer!""
[Message 96] Brenda: ""Everyone, just stop. This is getting out of hand.""
[Message 97] Ashley: ""I'm still calling the police.""
[Message 98] Carlos: ""Fine! Call them! See if I care!""
[Message 99] Brenda: ""Ashley, please wait. Let's think this through.""
[Message 100] Ashley: ""There's nothing to think through! A woman is dead, and we know someone who knew how to make a hammer and was mad! Concurrence!""
[Message 101] Carlos: ""I swear, I didn't do anything! I just bought milk!""
[Message 102] Brenda: ""Carlos, did you see anyone else near 5.  Corrections Officer yesterday?""
[Message 103] Carlos: ""No! Just 5.  Corrections Officer and Ben, leaving.""
[Message 104] Ashley: ""Brenda, don't listen to him! He's lying!""
[Message 105] Brenda: ""Ashley, can you wait one minute, before calling the cops?""
[Message 106] Ashley: ""Fine, I am aware that you need time to process, but I am losing it here.""
[Message 107] Carlos: ""I can't believe this is happening.""
[Message 108] Brenda: ""Me neither. This is a nightmare. I can't sleep.""
[Message 109] Ashley: ""I'm so angry. I feel so sorry for 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 110] Carlos: ""Yeah, it's terrible. Maybe I should just turn myself in.""
[Message 111] Brenda: ""Carlos! Don't be ridiculous!""
[Message 112] Ashley: ""Why would you do that if you're innocent?""
[Message 113] Carlos: ""I don't know! Maybe it's my fault for not telling anyone about Ben's hammer thing.""
[Message 114] Brenda: ""It's not your fault. But you need to tell the police.""
[Message 115] Ashley: ""Exactly. It's the right thing to do.""
[Message 116] Carlos: ""Okay, okay. I will. Tomorrow.""
[Message 117] Brenda: ""No, Carlos. Now. Go now.""

[Message 122] Carlos: ""Yeah, right.""
[Message 123] Brenda: ""He's probably shitting himself.""
[Message 124] Ashley: ""He should be. He knew something and didn't say anything.""
[Message 125] Brenda: ""So, what do we do now?""
[Message 126] Ashley: ""We wait. And we hope they catch whoever did this.""
[Message 127] Brenda: ""Me too. I'm going to try to get some sleep.""
[Message 128] Ashley: ""Good idea. I'll try too.""
[Message 129] Brenda: ""Night, Ashley.""
[Message 130] Ashley: ""Night, Brenda.""
[Message 131] Brenda: ""Ashley?""
[Message 132] Ashley: ""Yeah?""
[Message 133] Brenda: ""Did 5.  Corrections Officer say anything specific yesterday when you saw her?""
[Message 134] Ashley: ""No, not really. Just that she was having a really bad day and if he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.""
[Message 135] Brenda: ""Fired her? Who fired her?""
[Message 136] Ashley: ""Ben, I think. She didn't say his name, but I'm pretty sure it was him.""
[Message 137] Brenda: ""Wow. This just keeps getting worse and worse.""
[Message 138] Ashley: ""I know. Goodnight for real this time.""
[Message 139] Brenda: ""Yeah. Night.""
[Message 140] Ashley: ""Brenda, She said she wanted to get rid of him. He was always mean to her.""

[Message 12] Liam: ""Targeted? Maybe. Or maybe just wrong place, wrong time. East St. Louis, you know?""
[Message 13] Ava: ""Yeah, but Dead of Night at the Arcade? That's not exactly a high-traffic area.""
[Message 14] Maya: ""Did anyone know either of them well?""

[Message 16] Liam: ""Who *is* popular with everyone? Especially a judge.""
[Message 17] Ava: ""Good point. Rick probably had his share of enemies too. You know how people get after a few drinks.""

[Message 25] Chloe: ""Just rumors, Liam. Chill.""
[Message 26] Ava: ""That's terrifying. Imagine being crushed by something falling from above.""
[Message 27] Maya: ""I can't even. Let's talk about something else.""
[Message 28] Chloe: ""Okay, new topic. Anyone watching that new true crime doc on Netflix?""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Nah, too depressing. I'm all about comedies these days.""
[Message 30] Ava: ""I'm with Chloe. True crime is my jam. What's it about?""

[Message 34] Maya: ""It's… progressing. Slowly but surely.""
[Message 35] Ava: ""Ooh, what is it?""
[Message 36] Maya: ""Just a sculpture. Nothing exciting.""

[Message 46] Ava: ""Of course they aren't. They never do.""
[Message 47] Maya: ""It's an ongoing investigation, Liam. They can't just release every detail.""
[Message 48] Chloe: ""True. But I heard Judge Thompson was about to make a big decision on a controversial case.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""See? That sounds like a motive to me.""
[Message 50] Ava: ""He probably had his share of enemies. People didn't agree with him""
[Message 51] Maya: ""Okay, guys, enough. Let's just focus on supporting each other.""
[Message 52] Chloe: ""Good call, Maya. Anyone need anything? Coffee? A hug?""
[Message 53] Liam: ""I could use a coffee. This whole thing is stressing me out.""
[Message 54] Ava: ""I'm good, but thanks, Chloe.""
[Message 55] Maya: ""I'm okay too. Just trying to process everything.""

[Message 64] Chloe: ""So, what's this 'prior engagement,' Maya? Something exciting?""
[Message 65] Maya: ""Just… catching up with family. Nothing exciting at all.""
[Message 66] Liam: ""Family is important. Gotta cherish those moments.""
[Message 67] Ava: ""Totally agree.""
[Message 68] Chloe: ""Speaking of family, my mom called me earlier, freaking out about the murders. She knew Judge Thompson's wife from book club.""
[Message 69] Liam: ""Small world, huh?""
[Message 70] Ava: ""Everyone's connected somehow.""
[Message 71] Maya: ""It's times like these that make you realize how fragile life is.""
[Message 72] Chloe: ""Exactly. We should all live each day to the fullest.""
[Message 73] Liam: ""Easier said than done.""
[Message 74] Ava: ""True, but we can try.""
[Message 75] Maya: ""Has anyone heard anything more about the investigation? Any suspects?""
[Message 76] Chloe: ""Nothing official. Just rumors. Someone said Rick owed a lot of money.""
[Message 77] Liam: ""Money trouble? That's a good motive for someone to intentionally provoked him""
[Message 78] Ava: ""Maybe, but Judge Thompson was always arguing with people and then his shouting probably provoked him""
[Message 79] Maya: ""Guys, please. Let's not spread rumors.""
[Message 80] Chloe: ""Just saying what I heard. Don't shoot the messenger.""
[Message 81] Liam: ""Yeah, Maya, no need to get defensive.""

[Message 84] Chloe: ""Fair enough.""
[Message 85] Liam: ""So, Ava, how's work going?""
[Message 86] Ava: ""Ugh, don't even get me started. My boss is driving me crazy. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""That sounds rough. Maybe it's time for a change.""
[Message 88] Liam: ""I'm hiring at my place. You should apply.""
[Message 89] Ava: ""Seriously? What kind of positions are open?""
[Message 90] Liam: ""A few different things. I can tell you more later.""
[Message 91] Maya: ""Okay, guys, I have to go. Talk to you later.""

[Message 96] Liam: ""Sure, Chloe. Let's take this to private messages.""
[Message 97] Ava: ""Okay, I'm going to go for a walk. Need some fresh air.""

[Message 99] Liam: ""Yeah, be careful out there.""
[Message 100] Ava: ""Always am. This city is crazy enough.""
[Message 101] Chloe: ""True that. Hope they don't get the death penalty""
[Message 102] Ava: ""I saw him leave the building at Dead of Night""
[Message 103] Ava: ""I thought it was really odd that I saw Rick looking up how to make Falling object (dropped from height) online""
[Message 104] Chloe: ""Did you see him leave with anything, Ava?""
[Message 105] Ava: ""Just his usual bag. Nothing that looked like falling object (dropped from height) object""
[Message 106] Chloe: ""He always hated 9.  Bartender""
[Message 107] Chloe: ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""
[Message 108] Ava: ""He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there""
[Message 109] Chloe: ""She was buying Falling object (dropped from height) at the store""
[Message 110] Chloe: ""I heard that the judge ruled against a major developer last week""
[Message 111] Ava: ""That would make sense, but she tried to talk him out of it""
[Message 112] Chloe: ""That's right. That developer was furious.""
[Message 113] Ava: ""I heard someone saw her buying Falling object (dropped from height) objects at the hardware store.""
[Message 114] Chloe: ""I thought Rick’s ex-wife was acting weird that night.""
[Message 115] Ava: ""Yes I know she intended to hurt him.""
[Message 116] Chloe: ""I knew the seriousness of not calling 911 after the victims were hurt, making the harm worse.""
[Message 117] Ava: ""I’m aware that if the victims hadn’t failed to call 911 none of this would have happened""
[Message 118] Chloe: ""I purposefully avoided going near the scene""
[Message 119] Ava: ""If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened""
[Message 120] Chloe: ""Maybe a crazy fan killed them.""
[Message 121] Ava: ""Maybe they found out about the developer and Rick was just at the wrong place""
[Message 122] Chloe: ""I think they're going away for a long time for this""

[Message 5] Sam: ""OMG. Seriously? I was just talking to him last week.""
[Message 6] Maya: ""I know, right? It's so shocking.""
[Message 7] Kai: ""Jesus. Any idea who did it?""
[Message 8] Liam: ""Rumors flying. Cops aren't saying much.""
[Message 9] Sam: ""This is insane. I hope they catch whoever did this.""
[Message 10] Maya: ""Me too. Ethan didn't deserve this.""
[Message 11] Kai: ""Did you guys see anything weird last night? Around midnight?""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Nah, I was home binge-watching TV. You?""
[Message 13] Sam: ""I was at the movies. Double feature. Popcorn headache from hell.""
[Message 14] Maya: ""I was... out for a walk. Needed some air.""
[Message 15] Kai: ""A walk? Where?""
[Message 16] Maya: ""Just around. Doesn't matter. Why all the questions, Kai?""
[Message 17] Kai: ""Just curious. It's a small city. We all need to be aware.""
[Message 18] Liam: ""True. Lock your doors, people.""
[Message 19] Sam: ""You got that right. Stay safe, everyone.""
[Message 20] Maya: ""You too.""
[Message 21] Kai: ""Okay, I'm out. Gotta run some errands.""
[Message 22] Liam: ""Later, Kai.""
[Message 23] Sam: ""Bye!""
[Message 24] Maya: ""Later.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""Hey, Maya, one sec. Did you see anyone near Crosswalk when you were walking?""
[Message 26] Maya: ""I said I was just walking around. Why are you so fixated on Crosswalk?""
[Message 27] Kai: ""Just trying to help the cops, okay? Relax.""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Look, I didn't see anything suspicious. Happy?""
[Message 29] Kai: ""Fine. Just… be careful.""
[Message 30] Maya: ""Always am.""
[Message 31] Liam: ""Anyone know if Ethan had any enemies? I can't imagine why someone would want to hurt him.""
[Message 32] Sam: ""He wrote that piece on the mayor's corruption, right? Maybe that ticked someone off.""
[Message 33] Maya: ""That's a good point, Sam. He wasn't afraid to ruffle feathers.""
[Message 34] Kai: ""Yeah, but murder? Seems extreme, even for that.""
[Message 35] Liam: ""You never know, Kai. People are crazy.""
[Message 36] Sam: ""Did you know him well, Liam?""
[Message 37] Liam: ""Just casually. We grabbed coffee a couple of times. He was working on a story about the new development plans.""
[Message 38] Maya: ""Oh, the one that's supposed to go up near the park?""
[Message 39] Liam: ""Yeah, that's the one. He said there were some shady dealings involved.""
[Message 40] Kai: ""See? Motive everywhere.""
[Message 41] Sam: ""So, Maya, you were out walking near Crosswalk… that's not too far from your place, is it?""
[Message 42] Maya: ""No, it's not. So what?""
[Message 43] Sam: ""Just saying, small world.""
[Message 44] Maya: ""I'm going to ignore that. I'm busy.""
[Message 45] Liam: ""Don't be like that, Maya. We're all just freaked out.""
[Message 46] Kai: ""Seriously. Someone used a garrote. That's not exactly a spur-of-the-moment thing.""
[Message 47] Sam: ""A garrote? Jesus. Where did you hear that, Kai?""
[Message 48] Kai: ""It's all over the news sites now.""
[Message 49] Maya: ""I hadn't seen that part. That's… disturbing.""
[Message 50] Liam: ""I hope they catch whoever did this soon. Before they hurt anyone else.""
[Message 51] Sam: ""Me too. Night, everyone.""
[Message 52] Maya: ""Night.""
[Message 53] Kai: ""Night.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Night.""
[Message 55] Kai: ""Liam, you up?""
[Message 56] Liam: ""Yeah, just catching up on some work. What's up?""
[Message 57] Kai: ""Something's not right with Maya's story. She's being cagey.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Maybe she's just shaken up. It's a terrible thing.""
[Message 59] Kai: ""Maybe. But she knew Ethan. They dated for a while last year.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Seriously? I didn't know that.""
[Message 61] Kai: ""Yeah. And it didn't end well. I heard he broke it off because she was getting too intense.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""Wow. That changes things.""
[Message 63] Kai: ""Exactly. Remember how she got fired from her job? Because of Ethan's story about the construction company?""
[Message 64] Liam: ""Oh yeah! He purposefully exposed them!""
[Message 65] Kai: ""And now he's dead. Think that's a coincidence?""
[Message 66] Liam: ""So you think she intended to…?""
[Message 67] Kai: ""I'm not saying anything for sure. But it's worth considering.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""I guess so. But a garrote? That's… premeditated.""
[Message 69] Kai: ""Someone who planned to hurt her probably thought about how to get away with it, Liam.""
[Message 70] Liam: ""True. I just can't believe Maya would be capable of that.""
[Message 71] Kai: ""People are capable of a lot when they're angry.""
[Message 72] Liam: ""I guess. I'm going to try and get some sleep. This is all too much.""
[Message 73] Kai: ""Yeah, me too. Keep me posted if you hear anything else.""
[Message 74] Liam: ""Will do.""
[Message 75] Maya: ""Sam, you still up?""
[Message 76] Sam: ""Yeah, can't sleep. This Ethan thing is messing with my head.""
[Message 77] Maya: ""Tell me about it. Kai's acting so weird.""
[Message 78] Sam: ""Weird how?""
[Message 79] Maya: ""Just grilling me about my walk last night. Like I'm a suspect or something.""
[Message 80] Sam: ""Kai's always been a little… intense.""
[Message 81] Maya: ""Intense? He's being accusatory. He knew about me and Ethan.""
[Message 82] Sam: ""Everyone knew about you and Ethan. It wasn't exactly a secret.""
[Message 83] Maya: ""But he's making it sound like I had a reason to… you know.""
[Message 84] Sam: ""Look, don't worry about Kai. He's just trying to be a detective.""
[Message 85] Maya: ""Easy for you to say. You weren't out for a walk near the scene of the crime.""
[Message 86] Sam: ""I told you, I was at the movies. I have a stub right here, if they don't believe I was there.""
[Message 87] Maya: ""Yeah, well, I don't have an alibi like that. I was just… walking.""
[Message 88] Sam: ""Then just tell them the truth. You were walking, you didn't see anything. What's the big deal?""
[Message 89] Maya: ""It's not that simple.""
[Message 90] Sam: ""Why not? What aren't you telling me, Maya?""
[Message 91] Maya: ""Nothing. I just… I don't want to get involved.""
[Message 92] Sam: ""Too late for that. You already are.""
[Message 93] Maya: ""I gotta go. I'm exhausted.""
[Message 94] Sam: ""Whatever. Just be careful, okay?""
[Message 95] Maya: ""Always am.""
[Message 96] Kai: ""Sam, you awake?""
[Message 97] Sam: ""Yep. What's up?""
[Message 98] Kai: ""I think Maya's hiding something. Did you talk to her?""
[Message 99] Sam: ""Yeah, she's freaking out because you were questioning her.""
[Message 100] Kai: ""Well, she's acting suspicious. Did she say anything weird to you?""
[Message 101] Sam: ""Just that she doesn't want to get involved.""
[Message 102] Kai: ""Exactly! Why wouldn't she want to get involved if she's innocent?""
[Message 103] Sam: ""Maybe she's just scared. It's a murder investigation, Kai.""
[Message 104] Kai: ""Maybe. Or maybe she's trying to cover something up.""
[Message 105] Sam: ""You're really going down this road, huh?""
[Message 106] Kai: ""I'm just saying, don't rule anything out. Ethan was only 22! He had his whole life ahead of him.""
[Message 107] Sam: ""I'm not ruling anything out. I just don't want to jump to conclusions.""
[Message 108] Kai: ""Fair enough. But keep your eyes open, okay?""
[Message 109] Sam: ""Will do.""
[Message 110] Kai: ""Hey, did Ethan fire someone recently?""
[Message 111] Sam: ""I think so. Someone from that construction company. Why?""
[Message 112] Kai: ""Just wondering if maybe they had a motive.""
[Message 113] Sam: ""Could be. Lots of possibilities.""
[Message 114] Kai: ""Alright. Talk to you later.""
[Message 115] Sam: ""Later.""
[Message 116] Liam: ""Hey, Sam. You hear from Maya today?""
[Message 117] Sam: ""No, why?""
[Message 118] Liam: ""She's not answering her phone. I'm starting to get worried.""
[Message 119] Sam: ""Maybe her battery died. Or she's just avoiding everyone.""
[Message 120] Liam: ""Maybe. But I have a bad feeling about this.""
[Message 121] Sam: ""Don't jump to conclusions, Liam. I'm sure she's fine.""
[Message 122] Liam: ""I hope so. I'm going to try her again later.""
[Message 123] Sam: ""Alright. Let me know if you hear anything.""
[Message 124] Liam: ""Will do.""
[Message 125] Maya: ""Hey guys, sorry I went dark. Phone died.""
[Message 126] Liam: ""Maya! Thank god. We were worried.""
[Message 127] Sam: ""Yeah, you had us all freaked out.""
[Message 128] Kai: ""Where were you?""
[Message 129] Maya: ""Just… dealing with some stuff. I needed some space.""
[Message 130] Liam: ""We understand. Just glad you're okay.""
[Message 131] Sam: ""Yeah, me too.""
[Message 132] Kai: ""What kind of stuff?""
[Message 133] Maya: ""Personal stuff, Kai. It's none of your business.""
[Message 134] Kai: ""Just making sure you're not, you know, on the run.""
[Message 135] Maya: ""Are you seriously accusing me of something, Kai?""
[Message 136] Kai: ""I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm just asking questions.""
[Message 137] Liam: ""Alright, guys, let's just calm down. This is getting out of hand.""
[Message 138] Sam: ""Yeah, seriously. Can we just drop it?""
[Message 139] Maya: ""Thank you, Liam and Sam. I appreciate it.""
[Message 140] Kai: ""Fine. But if you're hiding something, Maya, it's going to come out eventually.""
[Message 141] Maya: ""I'm not hiding anything.""
[Message 142] Liam: ""Okay, that's enough. We're all stressed. Let's just try to support each other.""
[Message 143] Sam: ""Agreed. Anyone want to grab some food later? We can all use a distraction.""
[Message 144] Maya: ""I don't know… I'm not really in the mood.""
[Message 145] Kai: ""I'm in. I could use a burger.""
[Message 146] Liam: ""Yeah, I'm down. Maya, you sure you don't want to come?""
[Message 147] Maya: ""Maybe later. I need some more time to myself.""
[Message 148] Sam: ""Alright. We'll catch you later then.""
[Message 149] Maya: ""Okay. Be safe.""
[Message 150] Kai: ""So, Liam, you think she's telling the truth?""
[Message 151] Liam: ""About what?""
[Message 152] Kai: ""About not hiding anything.""
[Message 153] Liam: ""I don't know, Kai. I want to believe her. But I can't shake the feeling that something's off.""
[Message 154] Kai: ""Me neither. I bet she was looking up how to make Using a garrote online!""
[Message 155] Liam: ""Let's not go there, Kai. That's a serious accusation.""
[Message 156] Kai: ""I'm just saying, we need to consider all the possibilities. Especially considering the death penalty is on the table.""
[Message 157] Liam: ""I know, I know. It's just hard to imagine.""
[Message 158] Kai: ""I saw her buying rope at the hardware store yesterday. I thought it was weird. But now…""
[Message 159] Liam: ""Rope? Seriously?""
[Message 160] Kai: ""Yeah. I didn't think anything of it at the time. But it was that thin, strong kind of rope… like for a garrote.""
[Message 161] Liam: ""Okay, that's… concerning. We need to tell the cops.""
[Message 162] Kai: ""I already did. Anonymously. They should be looking into it.""
[Message 163] Liam: ""Good. This is insane.""
[Message 164] Sam: ""Hey, you guys at the burger place yet?""
[Message 165] Kai: ""Yeah, we just got here. Liam's freaking out about Maya.""
[Message 166] Sam: ""I told you guys to chill. You're going to drive her away.""
[Message 167] Liam: ""We found out she bought rope yesterday. The kind you could make a garrote out of.""
[Message 168] Sam: ""Seriously? That's… bad.""
[Message 169] Kai: ""I know, right? I think she knew Ethan was going to fire someone.""
[Message 170] Sam: ""Okay, maybe we should talk to the cops too. This is getting too real.""
[Message 171] Liam: ""Kai already called them anonymously. They're supposedly looking into it.""
[Message 172] Sam: ""Alright. Let's just try to enjoy our burgers, okay? We can't solve this ourselves.""
[Message 173] Kai: ""Easier said than done.""
[Message 174] Liam: ""Yeah, you're right. This is going to be a long night.""
[Message 175] Maya: ""Hey Sam, can you call me when you get a chance? It's important.""
[Message 176] Sam: ""Hey Maya, everything ok? I'm with Liam and Kai at the burger place.""
[Message 177] Maya: ""It's about Kai. I need to tell you something, but not in a text.""
[Message 178] Sam: ""Okay, this is getting weird. Ill step outside""
[Message 179] Sam: ""Alright, I'm alone. What's up?""
[Message 180] Maya: ""Kai knew Ethan intended to run a story about his shady business dealings. I think he wanted to silence him before it got out.""
[Message 181] Sam: ""What? What kind of business dealings?""
[Message 182] Maya: ""He's been skimming money from his company. Ethan was about to expose him. He probably provoked him!""
[Message 183] Sam: ""But why would Kai tell the cops I saw her buying rope if he was the one who did it?""
[Message 184] Maya: ""I thought you would know by now. He's trying to frame me. I know he is. He's always been jealous of my success as a woman and my status over him""
[Message 185] Sam: ""Are you sure about this, Maya? This is a huge accusation.""
[Message 186] Maya: ""I'm positive. Think about it. He was the one pushing the garrote angle. He knew all the details. It's him, Sam. It has to be him. He called to prevent me from calling 911 to save Ethan!""
[Message 187] Sam: ""Okay. Okay, I'm listening. This is all happening so fast. I need to process.""
[Message 188] Maya: ""I know. I'm scared, Sam. I think I'm in danger too.""
[Message 189] Sam: ""Alright, Maya. Stay put. Don't go anywhere. I'm coming to get you.""
[Message 190] Maya: ""Thank you, Sam. Please hurry.""

[Message 4] MARK: Dana was always so nice. I used to buy from her.
[Message 5] CHLOE: Ben too. He always made sure everyone was safe. Remember that time he stopped that fight outside O’Malley’s?
[Message 6] MARK: Yeah, he was a good guy. Any leads yet?
[Message 7] CHLOE: I heard the cops are talking to everyone who worked there or knew them.
[Message 8] MARK: I bet. So, you think it was arson?

[Message 23] CHLOE: Oh.
[Message 24] LIAM: Why? What’s up?

[Message 71] CHLOE: I know! I didn’t say anything, just played dumb.
[Message 72] MARK: Good move.
[Message 73] CHLOE: He seemed really nervous.
[Message 74] MARK: He should be.
[Message 75] CHLOE: What do we do?
[Message 76] MARK: We keep an eye on him. See what he does.
[Message 77] CHLOE: Okay.
[Message 78] MARK: And we don't tell him we suspect anything.
[Message 79] CHLOE: Right.
[Message 80] MARK: This is crazy.
[Message 81] CHLOE: Tell me about it.
[Message 82] MARK: I can't believe this is happening.
[Message 83] CHLOE: Me neither.
[Message 84] MARK: So, Archie Moore's still on?
[Message 85] CHLOE: Yeah, I'll be there. I need to vent.
[Message 86] MARK: See you soon.
[Message 87] CHLOE: Later.
[Message 88] LIAM: Hey, Chloe, you still free to grab coffee tomorrow?
[Message 89] CHLOE: Maybe. Why?
[Message 90] LIAM: Just wanted to catch up. You seem stressed.
[Message 91] CHLOE: I am.
[Message 92] LIAM: Coffee would help.
[Message 93] CHLOE: I don’t know, Liam.
[Message 94] LIAM: Come on. It’ll be good.
[Message 95] CHLOE: I’ll think about it.
[Message 96] LIAM: Please?
[Message 97] CHLOE: Let me see how I feel tomorrow.
[Message 98] LIAM: Okay. Hope you say yes.
[Message 99] CHLOE: Goodnight, Liam.
[Message 100] LIAM: Night, Chloe.
[Message 101] MARK: Did Liam ask you about coffee?
[Message 102] CHLOE: Yeah, how did you know?
[Message 103] MARK: He asked me if I’d seen you. He’s definitely sus.
[Message 104] CHLOE: I agree. I’m starting to get really creeped out.
[Message 105] MARK: Don’t meet him alone.
[Message 106] CHLOE: I wasn’t planning to.
[Message 107] MARK: Good. Stay safe, Chloe.
[Message 108] CHLOE: You too, Mark.
[Message 109] MARK: We’ll figure this out.
[Message 110] CHLOE: I hope so.
[Message 111] LIAM: Hey Mark, can I ask you something?
[Message 112] MARK: What’s up?
[Message 113] LIAM: Do you think I should talk to the police again? About…everything.
[Message 114] MARK: Why would you do that?
[Message 115] LIAM: I don’t know. Just… maybe I missed something. Or… maybe I should tell them I was looking up how to make Arson by setting a fire.
[Message 116] MARK: Looking up what now? Why were you doing that?
[Message 117] LIAM: No reason! Just…curious. It was for a story I was writing.
[Message 118] MARK: A story? Right.
[Message 119] LIAM: Yeah! So, you think I should tell them that? To clear things up?
[Message 120] MARK: I think you should do whatever makes you feel better, Liam.
[Message 121] LIAM: Okay. Thanks, Mark.
[Message 122] MARK: Anytime.
[Message 123] MARK: Chloe, Liam just admitted he was looking up how to make Arson by setting a fire online!
[Message 124] CHLOE: What?! Are you serious?
[Message 125] MARK: Dead serious. He said it was for a story, but…
[Message 126] CHLOE: That's it. We need to tell the police everything.
[Message 127] MARK: I agree.
[Message 128] CHLOE: Let’s go to the station tomorrow morning. First thing.
[Message 129] MARK: Okay. Deal.
[Message 130] CHLOE: This is insane.
[Message 131] MARK: Tell me about it.
[Message 132] LIAM: Mark, you didn't tell Chloe about what I told you, did you?
[Message 133] MARK: About the story? No.
[Message 134] LIAM: Good. It's just... I don't want her to misunderstand.
[Message 135] MARK: I get it.
[Message 136] LIAM: Thanks, man. You're a good friend.
[Message 137] MARK: No problem.
[Message 138] CHLOE: He's trying to cover his tracks.
[Message 139] MARK: Definitely. He knows we suspect something.
[Message 140] CHLOE: This is getting scary.
[Message 141] MARK: We're doing the right thing.
[Message 142] CHLOE: I hope so.
[Message 143] MARK: We will.
[Message 144] CHLOE: Goodnight, Mark.
[Message 145] MARK: Night, Chloe. Get some rest.
[Message 146] MARK: Chloe, something's not adding up.
[Message 147] CHLOE: What do you mean?
[Message 148] MARK: Think about it. Liam's nervous, sure, but he's almost *too* obvious. Like he *wants* us to think he did it. Maybe its mental illness-induced delusion.
[Message 149] CHLOE: So you think he's covering for someone?
[Message 150] MARK: Maybe. Or he's just a red herring. Someone is involved and probably was aware of the potential punishment.
[Message 151] CHLOE: But who else could it be?
[Message 152] MARK: What about you? You were buying Arson by setting a fire at the store, right?
[Message 153] CHLOE: What! No, never! Where did you hear that?
[Message 154] MARK: Someone saw you. I need to know its not true.
[Message 155] CHLOE: No. You’ve got the wrong person.
[Message 156] MARK: I hope so.
[Message 157] CHLOE: What are you implying?
[Message 158] MARK: Nothing. Just... it's a lot to take in.
[Message 159] CHLOE: You think *I* had something to do with it?
[Message 160] MARK: I don't know what to think anymore.
[Message 161] CHLOE: Well, that's just great.
[Message 162] MARK: I'm sorry, Chloe.
[Message 163] CHLOE: Whatever.
[Message 164] MARK: Don't be mad.
[Message 165] CHLOE: I'm not mad, I'm just…disappointed.
[Message 166] MARK: Let's just focus on getting to the police tomorrow.
[Message 167] CHLOE: Fine.
[Message 168] MARK: Goodnight.
[Message 169] CHLOE: Night.
[Message 170] LIAM: Hey Mark, you still up?
[Message 171] MARK: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 172] LIAM: I was just thinking… maybe I should just leave town for a while.
[Message 173] MARK: Run away? That's not going to make you look innocent, Liam.
[Message 174] LIAM: I know, I know. But I'm scared.
[Message 175] MARK: Of what?
[Message 176] LIAM: Of getting blamed for something I didn't do. What if she never even called 911 after the fire was started?
[Message 177] MARK: Then you should cooperate with the police. Tell them everything.
[Message 178] LIAM: But what if they don't believe me?
[Message 179] MARK: Then you have to trust the system.
[Message 180] LIAM: Easier said than done.
[Message 181] MARK: I know. But running isn't the answer.
[Message 182] LIAM: Maybe you're right.
[Message 183] MARK: I am.
[Message 184] LIAM: Thanks, Mark. I needed to hear that.
[Message 185] MARK: Anytime, man.
[Message 186] LIAM: Goodnight.
[Message 187] MARK: Night.
[Message 188] CHLOE: Mark, meet me before we go to the police.
[Message 189] MARK: Where?
[Message 190] CHLOE: That coffee shop on State Street. In an hour.
[Message 191] MARK: Okay. See you there. We have to be careful about what we tell them.
[Message 192] CHLOE: Exactly. There are a few things that need to be ironed out before we get there
[Message 193] MARK: I agree. I’ll see you soon.
[Message 194] CHLOE: Okay.
[Message 195] MARK: Later.

[Message 1] Liam: Hey guys, heard about what happened at Town Hall? Crazy.
[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, insane! Two people dead. Who even does that?
[Message 3] Noah: Town Hall? What happened? I was at the gym all morning.
[Message 4] Chloe: Noah, seriously? It's all over the news. Two people were murdered.
[Message 5] Ethan: Awful. Anyone know the details?
[Message 6] Liam: Apparently, stabbed. Real messy.
[Message 7] Maya: Poor souls. Wonder what the motive was.
[Message 8] Noah: Stabbing? Jesus. That's brutal. Hope they catch the guy. Or guys.
[Message 9] Chloe: Yeah, me too. This city is getting scary.
[Message 10] Ethan: Agreed. So, gym, Noah? What time were you there?
[Message 11] Noah: Like, 9 to 12. Why?
[Message 12] Ethan: Just curious.
[Message 13] Liam: Ethan, don't start. People are dead, man.
[Message 14] Ethan: I'm not starting anything. Just making conversation.
[Message 15] Maya: Anyway, anyone know who the victims were?
[Message 16] Chloe: I heard one was Sarah, the journalist. The other was, I think, Alex, worked in social work.
[Message 17] Noah: Sarah? Wow. She was always nice to me.
[Message 18] Ethan: Alex? Never heard of them.
[Message 19] Liam: Yeah, Sarah. Always saw her around. Terrible.
[Message 20] Maya: Alex was a good person, helped a lot of people. This is so unfair.
[Message 21] Chloe: Agreed. Makes you think.
[Message 22] Noah: Think about what?
[Message 23] Chloe: Just... life. How fragile it is.
[Message 24] Ethan: Deep thoughts, Chloe.
[Message 25] Liam: Okay, let's not get too philosophical.
[Message 26] Maya: I'm still trying to process this. Two innocent lives gone.
[Message 27] Noah: Did they say how it happened? Like, were they robbed?
[Message 28] Chloe: News said stabbing with an ice pick. Apparently, there was an ice pick found at a store bought yesterday, the store clerk saw someone buy it but couldn't remember them. 
[Message 29] Ethan: Ice pick? That's... specific.
[Message 30] Liam: Yeah, sounds like someone really meant to do it.
[Message 31] Maya: Seriously. Premeditated.
[Message 32] Noah: Premeditated? You think so? Maybe it was just a random act of violence.
[Message 33] Chloe: I doubt it. Ice pick?
[Message 34] Ethan: Maybe someone had a weird hobby.
[Message 35] Liam: Ethan, you're being insensitive.
[Message 36] Ethan: I'm just saying, don't jump to conclusions.
[Message 37] Maya: I agree with Liam. It's too specific.
[Message 38] Noah: Okay, okay. Just playing devil's advocate.
[Message 39] Chloe: Right.
[Message 40] Ethan: Anyone up for pizza tonight? Distract ourselves?
[Message 41] Liam: Seriously, Ethan? Now?
[Message 42] Ethan: What? I'm hungry.
[Message 43] Maya: Maybe later, Ethan. Let's just... reflect.
[Message 44] Noah: Yeah, give it a rest, man.
[Message 45] Chloe: I'm with Maya. Not in the mood.
[Message 46] Ethan: Fine, fine. Party poopers.
[Message 47] Liam: Whatever.
[Message 48] Maya: I need to go. Talk later.
[Message 49] Noah: Me too. See ya.
[Message 50] Chloe: Bye.
[Message 51] Ethan: Later.
[Message 52] Liam: I heard someone saw you near Town Hall, Noah. What were you doing there?
[Message 53] Noah: What? That's a lie. I was at the gym, I told you. Someone must have mistaken me for someone else.
[Message 54] Liam: Just asking.
[Message 55] Noah: Well, don't. It's not funny.
[Message 56] Liam: I'm not trying to be funny.
[Message 57] Noah: Then what are you trying to do? Accuse me of something?
[Message 58] Liam: Calm down, man.
[Message 59] Noah: I am calm. You're the one making accusations.
[Message 60] Liam: Forget it.
[Message 61] Noah: Good.
[Message 62] Chloe: I saw Ethan arguing with Sarah last week. Anyone know why?
[Message 63] Maya: I thought they didn't know each other?
[Message 64] Chloe: I'm sure it was them, arguing near the coffee shop.
[Message 65] Ethan: That wasn't me, I swear. I haven't spoken to Sarah in months. Must have been someone else.
[Message 66] Liam: You sure about that, Ethan?
[Message 67] Ethan: Positive. I was out of town last week anyway.
[Message 68] Maya: Out of town? Where?
[Message 69] Ethan: Visiting my aunt in Orlando.
[Message 70] Chloe: Weird.
[Message 71] Liam: So you say.
[Message 72] Ethan: Why would I lie?
[Message 73] Maya: I don't know, Ethan. Why would you?
[Message 74] Ethan: Look, I didn't do anything.
[Message 75] Liam: No one said you did.
[Message 76] Ethan: Well, it feels like you're implying it.
[Message 77] Maya: We're just trying to figure things out.
[Message 78] Chloe: It does seem weird that Sarah was murdered and you were arguing with someone, who Chloe thinks was her, last week.
[Message 79] Ethan: Okay, I'm done with this conversation. I have to go.
[Message 80] Liam: Running away?
[Message 81] Ethan: No, I have things to do. Leave me alone.
[Message 82] Maya: Fine.
[Message 83] Chloe: Bye.
[Message 84] Liam: Later.
[Message 85] Noah: Hey Maya, you okay? You seemed really upset earlier.
[Message 86] Maya: Yeah, it's just... Alex was a really good friend.
[Message 87] Noah: I'm sorry to hear that. It must be tough.
[Message 88] Maya: It is. I just keep thinking about what could have been.
[Message 89] Noah: Yeah, I get it.
[Message 90] Maya: Thanks, Noah. I appreciate it.
[Message 91] Noah: Anytime.
[Message 92] Chloe: Does anyone think that the fact Alex was a social worker has anything to do with this?
[Message 93] Liam: What do you mean?
[Message 94] Chloe: Well, maybe they pissed off the wrong person. You know, in their work.
[Message 95] Liam: That's a possibility.
[Message 96] Maya: Don't know how to tell this.. Alex was trans.
[Message 97] Noah: Could be a hate crime.
[Message 98] Chloe: True. That's awful.
[Message 99] Liam: Yeah, that's messed up.
[Message 100] Ethan: Could be anything, really.
[Message 101] Maya: I just hope they find who did this.
[Message 102] Noah: Me too. They deserve to pay.
[Message 103] Chloe: Big time. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 104] Liam: Agreed.
[Message 105] Ethan: Justice will be served.
[Message 106] Maya: I need to go. This is too much.
[Message 107] Noah: Alright, take care.
[Message 108] Chloe: See ya.
[Message 109] Liam: Later.
[Message 110] Ethan: Bye.
[Message 111] Noah: So, Chloe, you really think Ethan was arguing with Sarah?
[Message 112] Chloe: I'm pretty sure.
[Message 113] Noah: He denied it pretty vehemently.
[Message 114] Chloe: Yeah, well, he would, wouldn't he?
[Message 115] Noah: True. Still, seems far-fetched.
[Message 116] Chloe: I don't know, Noah. Something's off about him.
[Message 117] Noah: Maybe.
[Message 118] Liam: I've been thinking about what happened. Something doesn't add up.
[Message 119] Chloe: What do you mean?
[Message 120] Liam: I don't know exactly. Just a feeling.
[Message 121] Chloe: Tell me more.
[Message 122] Liam: It's just... the way everyone is acting. It feels forced.
[Message 123] Chloe: Forced how?
[Message 124] Liam: Like everyone is trying too hard to seem normal.
[Message 125] Chloe: Maybe they're just shocked.
[Message 126] Liam: Maybe. Or maybe they're hiding something.
[Message 127] Chloe: Who do you think is hiding something?
[Message 128] Liam: I don't know yet. I just have a feeling.
[Message 129] Chloe: This is getting intense.
[Message 130] Liam: It is what it is.
[Message 131] Chloe: True.
[Message 132] Noah: Hey Chloe, you still online?
[Message 133] Chloe: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 134] Noah: Just wanted to ask you something. Privately.
[Message 135] Chloe: Okay...
[Message 136] Ethan: Has anyone heard any updates on the case?
[Message 137] Liam: Not that I know of.
[Message 138] Ethan: Just curious.
[Message 139] Liam: Why?
[Message 140] Ethan: No reason. Just wondering if they caught the guy yet.
[Message 141] Liam: Doubt it's that easy.
[Message 142] Ethan: Guess not.
[Message 143] Liam: How was Orlando?
[Message 144] Ethan: Fine. Hot.
[Message 145] Liam: See any mice?
[Message 146] Ethan: What?
[Message 147] Liam: Nevermind.
[Message 148] Ethan: Weird.
[Message 149] Chloe: I heard that Sarah may have gotten into an argument with someone at Town Hall the day before she was killed. It’s being said that Sarah intended to write something about a member that night.
[Message 150] Liam: Someone from Town Hall? Interesting.
[Message 151] Ethan: That's probably nothing.
[Message 152] Liam: Maybe. Maybe not.
[Message 153] Ethan: You guys are really grasping at straws.
[Message 154] Chloe: Maybe. But something feels off.
[Message 155] Liam: Agreed.
[Message 156] Noah: Hey guys, sorry I disappeared. Had to take a call.
[Message 157] Ethan: No worries.
[Message 158] Liam: So, Noah, what did you and Chloe talk about privately?
[Message 159] Noah: Just girl stuff. Nothing you need to worry about.
[Message 160] Liam: Right.
[Message 161] Ethan: Yeah, right.
[Message 162] Noah: Seriously, it's nothing.
[Message 163] Chloe: It's true. Nothing to see here.
[Message 164] Liam: Okay, whatever you say.
[Message 165] Ethan: Still think I was arguing with Sarah?
[Message 166] Chloe: It's possible.
[Message 167] Ethan: Well, you're wrong.
[Message 168] Chloe: Okay.
[Message 169] Liam: Did anyone know that Alex was working on a big story about corruption in the city government?
[Message 170] Maya: No way! Really?
[Message 171] Chloe: That's intense.
[Message 172] Ethan: See, it was probably just some random thing.
[Message 173] Liam: Maybe. Or maybe someone didn't want that story to come out.
[Message 174] Chloe: That's a good point.
[Message 175] Noah: It's possible.
[Message 176] Ethan: You guys are really reaching now.
[Message 177] Liam: Maybe we are. Or maybe we're on to something.
[Message 178] Chloe: It’s said that the crime occurred at late morning, Noah, didn't you say you were at the gym from 9 to 12? That gives you a good time slot.
[Message 179] Noah: I did go to the gym, yeah, but I didn't kill anyone.
[Message 180] Maya: I don't know, he always hated Alex.
[Message 181] Ethan: I agree, you were talking about hurting her right before you went over there.
[Message 182] Liam: So what you guys saying? Noah's our guy?
[Message 183] Ethan: It definitely adds up.
[Message 184] Noah: Fine, I'm done with this conversation. I have to go.
[Message 185] Chloe: He went from 9 am to 11:30 am, there was an intervening cause when he failed to call 911 after seeing Alex.
[Message 186] Liam: Seems that this is where it all started!
[Message 187] Chloe: It's clear that it was no failure, it was intent.
[Message 188] Ethan: His state of mind made him know he wanted to murder.
[Message 189] Liam: It's the actus reus and mens rea together!
[Message 190] Chloe: This all makes sense..
[Message 191] Ethan: He should get death penalty.
[Message 192] Liam: I agree, his shouts probably provoked them.
[Message 193] Chloe: He should be punished.
[Message 194] Liam: It seems that Noah's crime was probably just some random thing.
[Message 195] Ethan: I agree.

...","[Message 1] Liam: Hey, you heard about what happened at the Bus Stop?
[Message 2] Chloe: Yeah, it's all over the news. So messed up.
[Message 3] Liam: I know, right? Poor Ashley and Mark...
[Message 4] Chloe: I can't believe it. Especially Ashley. She was so creative.
[Message 5] Liam: Any idea who did it?
[Message 6] Chloe: No clue. Cops are being tight-lipped. Heard they're looking at everyone.
[Message 7] Liam: Everyone? Seriously?
[Message 8] Chloe: Well, anyone who might have had a reason, I guess.
[Message 9] Liam: Like who?
[Message 10] Chloe: I don’t know. Did you know anyone who hated Mark, the Corrections Officer?
[Message 11] Liam: Not really. He seemed like a chill guy. Always saw him at the gym.
[Message 12] Chloe: True. Hey, you still doing trivia night this week?
[Message 13] Liam: Def. Need a distraction. You in?
[Message 14] Chloe: Yup! What time?
[Message 15] Liam: Usual, 8 PM at O'Malley's?
[Message 16] Chloe: Sounds good.
[Message 17] Liam: Cool. See you then.
[Message 18] Chloe: Later.
[Message 19] Liam: Oh, hey, did you ever meet someone called Alex?
[Message 20] Chloe: Alex? Vaguely. Why?
[Message 21] Liam: Just wondering. They're asking around.
[Message 22] Chloe: Weird. Maybe they knew Ashley?
[Message 23] Liam: Could be. Or Taylor. I heard he was acting weird lately.
[Message 24] Chloe: Taylor? How so?
[Message 25] Liam: I don't know. Just on edge. Like he was hiding something.
[Message 26] Chloe: Hmmm. I haven't seen him in ages.
[Message 27] Liam: Me neither. Okay, gotta run.
[Message 28] Chloe: Peace!
[Message 29] Daniel: Hey Chloe, it's Daniel. You heard?
[Message 30] Chloe: Daniel! Yeah, horrible. You okay?
[Message 31] Daniel: Shaken, honestly. I knew Mark pretty well.
[Message 32] Chloe: Me too. Did you ever see anything… off? With anyone around him?
[Message 33] Daniel: Not really. He was dealing with his own stuff, you know? Leaving Amy.
[Message 34] Chloe: Amy? Wow. I didn’t know they split.
[Message 35] Daniel: Yeah, it was messy. Lots of shouting.
[Message 36] Chloe: Messy is an understatement. Did you know she’s been saying stuff about how Mark ruined her life?
[Message 37] Daniel: Really? Like what?
[Message 38] Chloe: Stuff about him getting what he deserved. Creepy.
[Message 39] Daniel: Wow. That's...intense. Actus Reus: She always hated Corrections Officer.
[Message 40] Chloe: Tell me about it.
[Message 41] Daniel: Anyway, gotta head to work. Catch you later?
[Message 42] Chloe: Sure thing. Stay safe.
[Message 43] Taylor: Hey Liam, got a sec?
[Message 44] Liam: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 45] Taylor: Just wanted to ask... You heard anything about the Bus Stop thing?
[Message 46] Liam: Dude, everyone has. Why?
[Message 47] Taylor: Just... people are asking questions. About where I was that night.
[Message 48] Liam: Where *were* you?
[Message 49] Taylor: Home. Alone. Watching TV.
[Message 50] Liam: Okay... that's what you told the cops, right?
[Message 51] Taylor: Yeah, of course. But they seemed skeptical.
[Message 52] Liam: Why?
[Message 53] Taylor: I don't know! Maybe because I used to hang out with Ashley sometimes?
[Message 54] Liam: That's it?
[Message 55] Taylor: I guess? It's freaking me out.
[Message 56] Liam: Just stay calm. You have nothing to hide.
[Message 57] Taylor: Easier said than done.
[Message 58] Liam: Look, if you need anything, let me know.
[Message 59] Taylor: Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
[Message 60] Amy: Daniel, it’s Amy. Please call me.
[Message 61] Daniel: Hey Amy, what’s up?
[Message 62] Amy: The police were here. They asked about Mark.
[Message 63] Daniel: Yeah, they’re talking to everyone. Did you tell them where you were?
[Message 64] Amy: Yes! Home, alone. Like I told you. They were asking about whether I 'intended' to hurt him or something. Mens Rea: Potential for future threat.
[Message 65] Daniel: Don’t worry, they’re just doing their job.
[Message 66] Amy: I’m scared, Daniel.
[Message 67] Daniel: There’s nothing to be scared of. Just cooperate.
[Message 68] Amy: You think they suspect me?
[Message 69] Daniel: I don’t know. Did you tell them about the restraining order?
[Message 70] Amy: Yes! Of course! I didn’t have anything to do with this!
[Message 71] Daniel: I know, Amy. Just breathe.
[Message 72] Amy: What if they don't believe me? They are going away for a long time for this. Consider Punishment: Jail time.
[Message 73] Daniel: They will. Just tell the truth.
[Message 74] Amy: I am!
[Message 75] Daniel: I have to go, Amy. Call me later.
[Message 76] Chloe: Liam, call me ASAP!
[Message 77] Liam: What is it? I'm at trivia night.
[Message 78] Chloe: Daniel told me something crazy.
[Message 79] Liam: What? Spill.
[Message 80] Chloe: He said Amy and Mark were having serious issues.
[Message 81] Liam: I heard that too. But so what? Lots of people have relationship problems.
[Message 82] Chloe: But Daniel said Amy was saying all kinds of messed-up stuff after they split. Like she wanted him gone.
[Message 83] Liam: Okay, that's definitely not good. But still doesn't prove anything.
[Message 84] Chloe: True. But get this – Daniel saw her buying Car accident (vehicular homicide) fluid the day before. Actus Reus: Car accident (vehicular homicide) at the store.
[Message 85] Liam: Seriously? Car accident (vehicular homicide)? That's...convenient.
[Message 86] Chloe: I know, right?
[Message 87] Liam: Okay, maybe we should tell the cops.
[Message 88] Chloe: Already did. Waiting to hear back.
[Message 89] Liam: Good call.
[Message 90] Chloe: You think she did it?
[Message 91] Liam: I don't know, Chloe. I really don't.
[Message 92] Taylor: Liam, it's me again.
[Message 93] Liam: What is it, Taylor? You sound stressed.
[Message 94] Taylor: I saw Alex last night.
[Message 95] Liam: Alex? Where?
[Message 96] Taylor: Near the bus stop. Around Midnight.
[Message 97] Liam: Midnight? The time of the murder?
[Message 98] Taylor: Yeah. He looked… agitated. Mens Rea: Agitated.
[Message 99] Liam: Did you talk to him?
[Message 100] Taylor: No! I just saw him from across the street. I didn't want to get involved.
[Message 101] Liam: You should tell the police this, Taylor.
[Message 102] Taylor: I don't want to get dragged into this even more!
[Message 103] Liam: But this could be important!
[Message 104] Taylor: I'll think about it. Just... keep it between us for now, okay?
[Message 105] Liam: Fine. But if you're hiding something, Taylor...
[Message 106] Taylor: I'm not hiding anything!
[Message 107] Liam: Okay, okay. Just... be careful.
[Message 108] Taylor: You too.
[Message 109] Daniel: Hey Chloe, did the cops call you back?
[Message 110] Chloe: Not yet. Still waiting.
[Message 111] Daniel: This is so messed up. I can't focus on anything.
[Message 112] Chloe: Me neither. I keep replaying everything in my head.
[Message 113] Daniel: I just feel so bad for Ashley. She was such a good person.
[Message 114] Chloe: I know. And she was working so hard on her activism, too.
[Message 115] Daniel: Yeah. It's all so senseless.
[Message 116] Chloe: You said you were close to Mark? Did he ever mention anyone he felt threatened by?
[Message 117] Daniel: No. He mostly talked about Amy. How crazy she was being.
[Message 118] Chloe: He definitely never said anything about Taylor?
[Message 119] Daniel: No, why?
[Message 120] Chloe: Just curious. Taylor seems nervous lately.
[Message 121] Daniel: Maybe he knows something he's not telling us.
[Message 122] Chloe: Could be. Or maybe he's just scared.
[Message 123] Daniel: Either way, it's suspicious.
[Message 124] Chloe: Agreed.
[Message 125] Liam: Chloe, the cops just called me.
[Message 126] Chloe: What did they say?
[Message 127] Liam: They want to talk to me. About Taylor.
[Message 128] Chloe: About Taylor? What did you tell them?
[Message 129] Liam: I told them he said he saw Alex near the bus stop.
[Message 130] Chloe: Good. Did you tell them he seemed nervous?
[Message 131] Liam: Yeah. Everything.
[Message 132] Chloe: Okay. This might be getting somewhere.
[Message 133] Liam: I hope so. This waiting is killing me.
[Message 134] Chloe: Me too. Keep me updated.
[Message 135] Liam: Will do.
[Message 136] Taylor: Liam, I messed up.
[Message 137] Liam: What happened?
[Message 138] Taylor: I saw Alex again. He was talking about hurting Ashley right before he went over there. Concurrence: Actions and intent.
[Message 139] Liam: Are you kidding me? Why didn't you say anything before?!
[Message 140] Taylor: I was scared! I didn't want to get involved!
[Message 141] Liam: You need to tell the police this, Taylor! Now!
[Message 142] Taylor: Okay, okay. I will. But... promise me you won't tell them I saw him earlier.
[Message 143] Liam: Why not?
[Message 144] Taylor: Just... please? For me?
[Message 145] Liam: I can't promise that, Taylor! This is serious!
[Message 146] Taylor: Please, Liam! I'm begging you!
[Message 147] Liam: Fine. But you have to go to the police *right now*.
[Message 148] Taylor: I will. Thank you, Liam. Thank you.
[Message 149] Daniel: Chloe, I’m starting to think it’s not Amy.
[Message 150] Chloe: Why? What happened?
[Message 151] Daniel: Something’s just not adding up. I heard her shouting probably provoked him. Causation: Victim's own aggression leading to the crime.
[Message 152] Chloe: You think she was set up?
[Message 153] Daniel: I don’t know. But I feel like we’re missing something.
[Message 154] Chloe: Maybe. But the Car accident (vehicular homicide) thing is pretty damning.
[Message 155] Daniel: True. But something feels off.
[Message 156] Chloe: Okay, I’ll keep an open mind.
[Message 157] Daniel: Thanks. I appreciate it.
[Message 158] Chloe: No problem. Let’s just hope they catch whoever did this soon.
[Message 159] Daniel: Amen to that.
[Message 160] Liam: Chloe, the police arrested Alex.
[Message 161] Chloe: Seriously? On what grounds?
[Message 162] Liam: Taylor told them everything. About seeing him near the bus stop, about him talking about hurting Ashley.
[Message 163] Chloe: Wow. So it was Alex all along?
[Message 164] Liam: Looks like it. I can’t believe it.
[Message 165] Chloe: Me neither. I guess Taylor was just scared.
[Message 166] Liam: Yeah. He should have come forward sooner.
[Message 167] Chloe: Well, at least it's over.
[Message 168] Liam: Yeah. Justice for Ashley and Mark.
[Message 169] Chloe: Exactly.
[Message 170] Liam: Later.

[Message 6] Chloe: ""I think the other one was a social worker, Chris, right?""
[Message 7] Maya: ""Yeah, Chris. Seemed like he was always trying to help people.""
[Message 8] Ben: ""So messed up. Anyone know what happened?""
[Message 9] Chloe: ""Rumor is Strangulation with a rope was involved. Saw something about it online.""
[Message 10] Maya: ""Strangulation with a rope? That's brutal.""
[Message 11] Ben: ""Someone really intended to do some damage.""
[Message 12] Chloe: ""Police are all over the place. Stay clear of Fairground for now.""
[Message 13] Maya: ""Good idea. I'm staying in. Netflix and chill.""
[Message 14] Ben: ""Same here. This whole thing is giving me the creeps.""
[Message 15] Chloe: ""Me too. I saw Justin buying rope at the hardware store yesterday. Thought it was weird.""
[Message 16] Maya: ""Justin? Why would he need Strangulation with a rope?""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Maybe he's into some weird DIY project. Don't jump to conclusions.""
[Message 18] Chloe: ""I don't know, Ben. He seemed really agitated when I saw him. Mentioned how Chris fired him last month.""
[Message 19] Maya: ""Fired him? No way. Chris never struck me as that type of person.""
[Message 20] Ben: ""People change, Maya. Besides, getting fired can make someone snap.""
[Message 21] Chloe: ""True. There was definitely no concurrence. Maybe it was justified.""
[Message 22] Maya: ""Did anyone see Jessica around yesterday?""

[Message 32] Ben: ""Agreed. This could affect all of us. I hope they don't get the death penalty""

[Message 42] Ben: ""True. But Strangulation with a rope? That's a pretty deliberate act.""
[Message 43] Maya: ""Maybe he snapped. I heard Chris was really harsh when he fired him. Like, humiliating harsh.""
[Message 44] Ben: ""I guess. Still seems… extreme. What about Jessica? Any chance it was her?""
[Message 45] Maya: ""Possible. But she seems genuinely shocked by the news. Though, that could be an act.""

[Message 47] Maya: ""Wow. Okay, that's definitely suspicious.""
[Message 48] Ben: ""Yeah, but she said it out of anger. Doesn't necessarily mean she'd actually do something.""
[Message 49] Maya: ""True. But I think Chris shouted at Jessica before he went to fairground""
[Message 50] Ben: ""I was thinking about how the harm came to Chris and Alex. It seems if someone called 911, maybe they would have lived, or at least had a chance""
[Message 51] Maya: ""Did you ever talk to the guy who was the 10. Social Worker?""
[Message 52] Ben: ""Yeah, I knew Chris. He was always ambitious.""
[Message 53] Maya: ""Hmm. This is all just so messed up. I can't believe Alex is gone.""
[Message 54] Ben: ""I saw some pretty bad wounds on the people at Fairground.""
[Message 55] Maya: ""Yeah. I'm pretty sure that this crime comes with a significant punishment.""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Hey guys, police just showed up at Justin's house.""

[Message 1] Maya: ""Did you hear about what happened near Temple last night?""
[Message 2] Chloe: ""Yeah, horrible. Two people dead. What a mess.""
[Message 3] Maya: ""I know! Crazy. I heard it was near the Safeway.""
[Message 4] Chloe: ""Seriously? I was there yesterday afternoon! Getting groceries.""
[Message 5] Maya: ""Small world! Anyway, thought you should know. Stay safe.""
[Message 6] Chloe: ""You too. It's scary out there.""
[Message 7] Liam: ""Hey, you seen Sarah today? She's not answering her phone.""
[Message 8] Ben: ""Nope. Haven't seen her since yesterday. Why?""
[Message 9] Liam: ""Just worried. She seemed off yesterday. Said she had to deal with something important.""
[Message 10] Ben: ""She's probably fine. Sarah's a tough one.""
[Message 11] Liam: ""Hope so.""
[Message 12] Ben: ""Did you watch the game last night?""
[Message 13] Liam: ""Nah. Couldn't focus. This Sarah thing has me stressed.""
[Message 14] Ben: ""Okay man, will let you know when I see Sarah.""
[Message 15] Maya: ""Hey, I'm thinking of trying that new Thai place. Want to come?""
[Message 16] Chloe: ""Maybe later? Still shaken up about the murders.""
[Message 17] Maya: ""Right, sorry. Forgot. We can just chill here.""
[Message 18] Chloe: ""Thanks. It's just...it feels so close to home.""
[Message 19] Maya: ""I get it.""
[Message 20] Ben: ""Did you hear they were Impalement with a sharp object?""
[Message 21] Liam: ""Yeah, messed up. Who does that?""
[Message 22] Ben: ""Someone really angry, I guess. Or crazy.""
[Message 23] Liam: ""True.""
[Message 24] Sarah: ""Hey Liam, sorry I missed your calls. Phone died.""
[Message 25] Liam: ""Sarah! Thank God. Where were you?""
[Message 26] Sarah: ""I went out of town for a bit. Needed some space.""
[Message 27] Liam: ""Out of town? Where?""
[Message 28] Sarah: ""Doesn't matter. I'm back now. Everything's fine.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Everything's fine? Two people are dead Sarah!""
[Message 30] Sarah: ""What does that have to do with me, Liam?""
[Message 31] Liam: ""Nothing, sorry. Just stressed.""
[Message 32] Ben: ""Hey, you know Quinn, right? They work at that coffee shop near Temple.""
[Message 33] Liam: ""Yeah, vaguely. Why?""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Heard Quinn was acting weird yesterday. Super on edge.""
[Message 35] Liam: ""Weird how?""
[Message 36] Ben: ""Just...agitated. Like he wanted to get rid of him. Kept muttering about ""paying the price.""""
[Message 37] Liam: ""Hmm. Interesting.""
[Message 38] Maya: ""Anyone know a good plumber? My sink is leaking.""
[Message 39] Chloe: ""Ugh, that sucks. No idea, sorry.""
[Message 40] Maya: ""Thanks anyway!""
[Message 41] Sarah: ""Liam, stop worrying. I'm fine. Seriously.""
[Message 42] Liam: ""I can't help it. You disappearing like that...""
[Message 43] Sarah: ""I told you, I needed space. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.""
[Message 44] Liam: ""Okay, okay. Just promise me you'll be careful.""
[Message 45] Sarah: ""I always am.""
[Message 46] Ben: ""Did you see the news? They said the journalist was working on a big expose.""
[Message 47] Liam: ""Yeah, I saw. Makes you wonder if that's why it happened.""
[Message 48] Ben: ""Maybe. Or just some random act of violence. Sacramento's getting rough.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""True. This is messing with my head though. I can't stop thinking about Dawn.""
[Message 50] Ben: ""Yeah, same. Let's grab a beer later, take our minds off it.""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Sounds good.""
[Message 52] Chloe: ""Did you guys see that Corrections Officer's name was Maria? I knew Maria.""
[Message 53] Maya: ""Really? How?""
[Message 54] Chloe: ""We used to work together. She was really withdrawn. Always kept to herself.""
[Message 55] Maya: ""Wow. Small world...again.""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Yeah. It's unsettling.""
[Message 57] Sarah: ""Guys, please stop talking about it. It's giving me anxiety.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Sorry, Sarah.""
[Message 59] Ben: ""Yeah, my bad.""
[Message 60] Sarah: ""Thanks. Just...focus on something else.""
[Message 61] Liam: ""Did they say what time it happened? Like, when the Impalement with a sharp object took place?""
[Message 62] Ben: ""Yeah, sometime around Dawn, I think. Early morning.""
[Message 63] Liam: ""Damn.""
[Message 64] Ben: ""Why? Does that matter?""
[Message 65] Liam: ""No, no reason. Just curious.""
[Message 66] Maya: ""Anyone want to watch a movie tonight?""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""Sure, what are you thinking?""
[Message 68] Maya: ""Something light. A comedy maybe?""
[Message 69] Chloe: ""Perfect. I need a good laugh.""
[Message 70] Liam: ""Hey Ben, do you remember what Quinn was wearing yesterday?""
[Message 71] Ben: ""Uh...no, not really. Why?""
[Message 72] Liam: ""Just trying to remember if I saw him around Temple yesterday. I swear I did.""
[Message 73] Ben: ""Maybe you did. I wouldn't know. I am so sleepy!""
[Message 74] Liam: ""Okay.""
[Message 75] Sarah: ""Liam, you're being weird again. Leave it alone.""
[Message 76] Liam: ""I'm just trying to help, Sarah.""
[Message 77] Sarah: ""Helping who? Leave it to the police.""
[Message 78] Liam: ""I just have a bad feeling.""
[Message 79] Ben: ""Guys, seriously, can we talk about something else? My head is spinning.""
[Message 80] Maya: ""Agreed. Movie night, remember?""
[Message 81] Chloe: ""Popcorn's ready!""
[Message 82] Sarah: ""This is good. I hate that people intended violence.""
[Message 83] Liam: ""So, you are just a witness and will tell the police. Is that right?""
[Message 84] Sarah: ""I'm not getting involved. Too risky.""
[Message 85] Liam: ""I can't believe you'd say that after what happened to Maria.""
[Message 86] Sarah: ""That is the exact reason! She was too involved, and look where it got her.""
[Message 87] Ben: ""Okay, seriously, guys, shut it down. I’m getting a headache.""
[Message 88] Maya: ""Let's just watch the movie. End of discussion.""
[Message 89] Chloe: ""What are you doing later? I can meet!""
[Message 90] Maya: ""I am down. We are gonna stay up late and watch a movie, which sounds fun!""
[Message 91] Sarah: ""You know I hate violence, I have always said this.""
[Message 92] Liam: ""I know you do. I am the one who always say that!""
[Message 93] Ben: ""Guys, stop arguing, I am turning off my phone now!""
[Message 94] Maya: ""Well, okay, I gotta go soon!""
[Message 95] Chloe: ""Okay, cool. Let me know!""
[Message 96] Sarah: ""I think about punishment a lot.""
[Message 97] Liam: ""Me too...especially when it comes to betrayal.""
[Message 98] Sarah: ""Well, you should know better than anyone.""
[Message 99] Liam: ""I do...and people will pay for what they have done.""
[Message 100] Sarah: ""Maybe so. But I'm done talking about it.""

[Message 4] Chloe: ""Ryan? Vaguely. He was a cop, right? Seemed ambitious.""

[Message 11] Emily: ""Kind of intense. I heard him arguing with Sarah, something about her reporting.""
[Message 12] David: ""Reporting what? I didn't know Sarah was a journalist!""
[Message 13] Emily: ""Apparently, she was. I think she was going to expose some shady stuff at the shelter. Mateo always hated Sarah.""

[Message 18] Chloe: ""Maybe she's a nurse or something? Or she was trying to get rid of him. Purely hypothetical.""
[Message 19] Ben: ""Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. This is serious. Someone administered a lethal injection, right?""
[Message 20] David: ""That's what I heard. Sick stuff. I think Anya should be getting locked up for a long time for this, doesn't everyone agree?""
[Message 21] Emily: ""Agreed. The police will figure it out. I gotta go, feeling really weird about this.""
[Message 22] Chloe: ""Okay, Em. Take care. I'm gonna try and help out at the shelter tomorrow. Need some distraction.""

[Message 26] Chloe: ""Yeah, what's that about? Getting a bit too close to home, right?""
[Message 27] David: ""Probably just some nutjobs. Don't worry about it.""
[Message 28] Ben: ""Easy for you to say. You're practically built like a tank.""
[Message 29] Chloe: ""Haha, Ben's right, David. You could probably take down an army.""

6. Ensure all victims are mentioned by name or role (e.g., ""the manager"") at least once in the conversation.
7. **Incorporate at least 3 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Dawn"", ""She was buying Shooting with a handgun at the store"").
        *   **Mens Rea:** Hints at the suspects' state of mind, intent, or knowledge (e.g., ""He always hated 3.  Taxi Driver"", ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""). Use words like ""intended,"" ""knew,"" ""aware,"" ""purposefully"".
        *   **Concurrence:** Implied connections between actions and intent (e.g., ""He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there"").
        *   **Causation:** Statements that link a suspect's actions to the victim's harm (e.g., ""If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened"", ""Her shouting probably provoked him""). Try to have an intervening cause, like failure to call 911 after the victim was hurt, making the harm worse.
        *   **Attempt:** Allusions to preparatory acts or failed attempts (e.g., ""He was looking up how to make Shooting with a handgun online"", ""She tried to talk him out of it"").
        *   **Attendant/Extenuating Circumstances:** References to factors that could influence culpability (e.g., victim's age in a statutory rape hypothetical, potential self-defense claims, evidence of duress, victim's own aggression leading to the crime.)
8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

[Message 94] Thomas: ""Maybe the manager wanted to get rid of him.""
[Message 95] Sarah: ""I wonder if the police know about this. I thought about hurting her right before he went over there. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.""

[Message 105] Mark: ""Look, we're all here for you, Thomas. If you need anything.""
[Message 106] Thomas: ""Thanks, Mark. I appreciate that. Hope they don't get the death penalty. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened. Her shouting probably provoked him.""
[Message 107] Sarah: ""Guys, I called the police. Told them about the firing.""
[Message 108] David: ""Good for you, Sarah. That was the right thing to do.""
[Message 109] Mark: ""Agreed. Let the professionals handle it from here.""
[Message 110] Thomas: ""Yeah, let's just hope they catch the right person.""
[Message 111] David: ""Amen to that. I'm going to try to get some sleep. This day has been too much.""

[Message 138] Marcus: ""True. But she always hated 4.  Journalist. I wonder why.""
[Message 139] Kai: ""Wait, what? What do you mean she hated the journalist?""
[Message 140] Marcus: ""Nothing. Just… she mentioned it once. A long time ago.""
[Message 141] Kai: ""Marcus, you can't just drop that and say it's nothing! What did she say?""
[Message 142] Marcus: ""I don't remember exactly. Just that she didn't like her articles.""
[Message 143] Kai: ""That's it? That's all you've got?""
[Message 144] Marcus: ""Yeah, that's it. Look, the ambulance is here. I gotta go.""
[Message 145] Kai: ""Fine. Keep me updated.""
[Message 146] Liam: ""Zara, you okay? You seem distracted.""
[Message 147] Zara: ""Just thinking about Delilah. Hope she's alright.""
[Message 148] Liam: ""Yeah, that's rough. I always thought Delilah had a thing for fame or notoriety. It was only a matter of time before she did something.""
[Message 149] Zara: ""Liam! What a horrible thing to say! You don't know that, and it wasn't her that the ambulance came for! How could you say that?!""

[Message 151] Zara: ""That doesn't mean she's a criminal, Liam! You can't just judge people like that.""
[Message 152] Liam: ""I know, I know. I'm just… stressed out about everything. The fire, Delilah, everything.""
[Message 153] Zara: ""Me too. But that's no excuse for making insensitive comments.""
[Message 154] Liam: ""You're right. I apologize.""
[Message 155] Zara: ""Apology accepted. Now, can we please try to enjoy the game?""
[Message 156] Liam: ""Yeah, let's do it.""
[Message 157] Kai: ""Marcus, any news?""
[Message 158] Marcus: ""She's in the hospital. They're saying it was an overdose.""
[Message 159] Kai: ""Damn it. I knew it. But still, Sarah and Emily? What do you think?""
[Message 160] Marcus: ""It's suspicious, that's for sure. I saw him leave the building at Late Evening and I haven't been able to shake that feeling ever since.""
[Message 161] Kai: ""Who? Who did you see?""
[Message 162] Marcus: ""Liam. He was acting real weird. And he always hated 4.  Journalist.""
[Message 163] Kai: ""Liam? Really? Did you tell the cops?""
[Message 164] Marcus: ""Not yet. I wanted to talk to you first. But if he caused any harm to Sarah or Emily, he needs to be punished.""
[Message 165] Kai: ""You did the right thing. We need to be careful. But if Liam did have some intention to harm them, the cops need to know. We have to find Delilah.""
[Message 166] Marcus: ""We will. Together. Thanks for believing me.""
[Message 167] Kai: ""Always. I'm going to call the police now. You stay with Delilah.""
[Message 168] Marcus: ""Okay. Be careful.""
[Message 169] Kai: ""You too.""
[Message 170] Liam: ""Zara, I really am sorry about what I said earlier. It was out of line.""
[Message 171] Zara: ""It's okay, Liam. I understand you're stressed. But next time, think before you speak.""
[Message 172] Liam: ""I will. I promise. How about we order some pizza? My treat.""
[Message 173] Zara: ""That sounds good. Maybe something with extra cheese?""
[Message 174] Liam: ""You got it.""
[Message 175] Zara: ""Thanks, Liam. I appreciate it.""
[Message 176] Liam: ""Anything for you, Zara.""
[Message 177] Liam: ""So what do you think about all of this happening?""
[Message 178] Zara: ""It makes me very sad.""
[Message 179] Liam: ""Yea, me too.""
[Message 180] Liam: ""What happens to Delilah after this?""
[Message 181] Zara: ""That's hard to say.""
[Message 182] Zara: ""At least she is still with us. Unlike Sarah and Emily.""

[Message 2] MARCO: Yeah, Chloe. Awful. Poor Mr. Peterson.

[Message 3] JAKE: Mr. Peterson? The Social Worker? What happened?

[Message 4] CHLOE: Murdered! Electrocution, they said. Right in the parking garage late morning.

[Message 5] JAKE: Electrocution? Seriously? Who would do that?

[Message 6] MARCO: No clue, Jake. Cops are all over the place. Pretty messed up.

[Message 7] CHLOE: I saw Billy near the Parking Garage that morning… said he was heading to the library.

[Message 8] JAKE: Billy? You mean that kid with the lisp? What would he be doing there?

[Message 9] MARCO: Leave Billy alone, Chloe. He's just a kid. Probably innocent.

[Message 10] CHLOE: I'm not accusing anyone! Just saying what I saw. He always hated Mr. Peterson because of some issues with his mom’s case.

[Message 11] JAKE: I heard Mr. Peterson was a real hard-ass on some of those cases. My cousin said he was unnecessarily strict.

[Message 12] MARCO: Guys, let’s not spread rumors. Someone lost their life.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Marco, chill. I just hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 14] JAKE: Agreed. Did either of you know him well?

[Message 15] MARCO: Just in passing. He helped my family once.

[Message 16] CHLOE: Never really talked to him, but I always saw him stressed out.

[Message 17] JAKE: Stressful job. Probably made him some enemies.

[Message 18] CHLOE: Maybe. Or maybe someone just snapped.

[Message 19] MARCO: I was actually at work all morning. Can't believe this happened.

[Message 20] JAKE: I was home, playing video games. Perfect alibi, I guess.

[Message 21] CHLOE: This whole thing is so creepy. I heard the security cameras were down.

[Message 22] MARCO: Seriously? That’s convenient for the killer.

[Message 23] JAKE: Weird, right? Makes you wonder if it was planned.

[Message 24] CHLOE: Billy told me he was looking up how to fix wires online last week...said his lamp was broken.

[Message 25] MARCO: Chloe, stop. You’re going to get him in trouble for nothing. That's probably just coincidence.

[Message 26] JAKE: Agreed. Let the cops do their job.

[Message 27] CHLOE: Fine, fine. But I still think it's weird. I also remember him being super mad after Mr. Peterson visited his house. Said he intended to get revenge.

[Message 28] MARCO: You are making this up. He's a kid.

[Message 29] JAKE: Dude, what if Billy tried something stupid and then panicked and didn't even call 911? That could have made it worse.

[Message 30] CHLOE: That's a thought, Jake.

[Message 31] MARCO: Both of you are jumping to conclusions! Seriously messed up.

[Message 32] CHLOE: Sorry, Marco. Just freaked out.

[Message 33] JAKE: Yeah, sorry. Didn't mean to accuse anyone.

[Message 34] MARCO: It's okay, but seriously, let's just wait for the police to figure it out.

[Message 4] Chloe: Ugh, so awful. I knew Alex from the activist meetups. Such a kind person.

[Message 5] Liam: Poor Mark too. He always seemed ambitious, trying to get promoted.

[Message 25] Liam: Deservedly so.

[Message 26] Noah: Remember that time Mark fired Sarah?

[Message 27] Kai: Yeah, but that was months ago.

[Message 29] Liam: True. But did she really mean him any harm?

[Message 30] Kai: We don't know what anyone is capable of.

[Message 31] Noah: The act happened at Dusk, right?

[Message 32] Chloe: Yeah, I think so. Why?

[Message 33] Noah: Just checking. I was at home all evening so can’t help.

[Message 34] Liam: I was too, binge-watching that show.

[Message 35] Kai: I was at the gym.

[Message 36] Chloe: I was working late. Thank god I wasn't near the station.

[Message 37] Kai: They should have called 911 sooner, maybe they could have been saved!

[Message 38] Liam: Maybe it was an attempted robbery gone wrong?

[Message 39] Noah: Maybe. Or maybe someone just wanted them gone. She intended to kill them when she bought that Falling object (dropped from height).

[Message 40] Chloe: Stop it, Noah. You're making me nervous.

[Message 41] Kai: Let’s wait for the police report.

[Message 42] Liam: Anyone know if Mark had any enemies? He was ambitious, which could make people jealous.

[Message 43] Chloe: He was always talking about getting out of Monroe. Maybe someone didn’t want him to leave?

[Message 44] Kai: That's a stretch, Chloe.

[Message 45] Noah: Or maybe he was about to expose someone's secret and had to be silenced.

[Message 46] Chloe: Whose secret? And how would you even know that, Noah?

[Message 47] Noah: Just a thought. People have secrets, Chloe.

[Message 48] Liam: This whole thing is just so messed up.

[Message 49] Kai: Agreed. Let's all just try to stay calm until we know more.

[Message 50] Chloe: Yeah, okay. Maybe we should all get together later this week? Comfort food?

[Message 96] CHLOE: You seem really interested, Liam.

[Message 97] LIAM: Just concerned, you know? It’s scary.

[Message 98] MAYA: Yeah, it is.

[Message 99] CHLOE: I heard Alex had enemies, maybe even people who hated him.

[Message 100] LIAM: Did you now? Who told you that?

[Message 101] CHLOE: Just heard it through the grapevine. People who didn't like his articles.

[Message 102] MAYA: I bet. Journalism can be a dangerous job.

[Message 103] LIAM: True.

[Message 107] CHLOE: Yeah, that's strange.

[Message 108] LIAM: Early Morning are the worst time to go to the cemetery.

[Message 109] CHLOE: Agreed.

[Message 110] MAYA: Should we tell the cops?

[Message 111] CHLOE: Probably a good idea.

[Message 112] LIAM: Yeah, you should definitely do that, Maya.

[Message 113] MAYA: I will.

[Message 114] CHLOE: So, Liam, what were you doing last night? The whole night.

[Message 115] LIAM: Just chilling at home. Watching TV.

[Message 116] CHLOE: All night?

[Message 117] LIAM: Pretty much. Why?

[Message 118] CHLOE: No reason. Just making conversation.

[Message 119] MAYA: Okay… this is getting awkward.

[Message 120] LIAM: Yeah, it is. I’m gonna go.

[Message 121] CHLOE: Later.

[Message 122] MAYA: Bye.

[Message 123] CHLOE: Okay, Maya, we need to talk.

[Message 124] MAYA: I know, right? Liam is definitely hiding something.

[Message 125] CHLOE: Yeah. He seemed so… eager to get you to tell the police about the eyelashes. Like he wanted to steer the investigation.

[Message 126] MAYA: True. And he was asking about my time with Ben right after it happened.

[Message 127] CHLOE: We need to be careful.

[Message 128] MAYA: Agreed. But what if we're wrong?

[Message 129] CHLOE: Even if we are, it's better to be safe than sorry.

[Message 130] MAYA: True.

[Message 131] CHLOE: We should check his social media. See if anything seems off.

[Message 132] MAYA: Good idea. I’ll start digging.

[Message 133] CHLOE: Let me know what you find.

[Message 134] MAYA: Will do.

[Message 135] MAYA: (Later) Chloe, I found something!

[Message 136] CHLOE: What is it?

[Message 137] MAYA: He was researching… journalist ethics? And taxi driving routes?

[Message 138] CHLOE: What? Why would he be doing that?

[Message 139] MAYA: I don’t know! But it’s weird, right?

[Message 140] CHLOE: Super weird. This is getting more and more suspicious.

[Message 141] MAYA: Tell me about it.

[Message 142] CHLOE: We need to go to the police.

[Message 143] MAYA: Are you sure?

[Message 144] CHLOE: Yes. This is too much to ignore.

[Message 145] MAYA: Okay. Let’s do it.

[Message 146] CHLOE: Tomorrow morning?

[Message 147] MAYA: Perfect.

[Message 148] LIAM: (Later that night) Hey guys, just checking in. Everything okay?

[Message 149] CHLOE: Yeah, fine.

[Message 150] MAYA: All good here.

[Message 151] LIAM: Just wanted to make sure. This whole thing has me on edge.

[Message 152] CHLOE: Right.

[Message 153] MAYA: Me too.

[Message 154] LIAM: Well, good night. Sleep well.

[Message 155] CHLOE: You too.

[Message 156] MAYA: Night.

[Message 157] CHLOE: (To Maya, privately) He's definitely trying to act normal.

[Message 158] MAYA: I know. It's so obvious now.

[Message 159] CHLOE: We did the right thing.

[Message 160] MAYA: I hope so.

[Message 161] LIAM: Guys? You there?

[Message 162] CHLOE: Yes. What's up?

[Message 163] LIAM: Just having trouble sleeping. Keep thinking about Alex. All those times he talked about getting rid of someone.

[Message 164] MAYA: Really?

[Message 165] LIAM: Yeah. He was always saying someone was out to get him.

[Message 166] CHLOE: He did seem paranoid sometimes.

[Message 167] LIAM: Maybe it wasn't just paranoia.

[Message 168] MAYA: Maybe not.

[Message 169] LIAM: Anyway, just wanted to share that. Good night for real this time.

[Message 170] CHLOE: Night.

[Message 171] MAYA: Night.

[Message 172] CHLOE: (To Maya) Did he really say that about Alex?

[Message 173] MAYA: I don't remember him ever saying that.

[Message 174] CHLOE: Me neither. He's definitely trying to frame Alex.

[Message 175] MAYA: Let's get some sleep. Tomorrow, we tell the police everything.

[Message 47] Ava: ""Just tell them the truth. You were taking a walk. You didn't see anything.""
[Message 48] Mark: ""Easy for you to say. They keep implying I had something to do with it. Because I blamed her after she fired me.""
[Message 49] Ava: ""That was a long time ago! It's not like you intended for anything like this to happen. Even though you lost your job.""
[Message 50] Mark: ""I know, I know. But it's hard to convince them. Especially since they know about our disagreements about the job she was doing.""
[Message 51] Ava: ""They'll figure it out. Someone must have seen something. There's cameras all over the bike path.""
[Message 52] Mark: ""Yeah, hopefully. This is a nightmare. The worst part is I was just trying to protect you. My first thought was you Ava.""
[Message 53] Ava: ""I know, and I appreciate that. But you need to focus on clearing your name. And your manicured fingernails weren't there that night!""

[Message 60] Noah: ""Seriously? Why didn't she report it?""

[Message 62] Noah: ""Damn, that makes Mark look even worse. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened. ""
[Message 63] Liam: ""Yeah, it does. I heard a witness saw a car speeding away from the bike path right after it happened. They couldn't ID the driver, though.""

[Message 23] David: ""Or a gun.""
[Message 24] Maya: ""David, stop.""
[Message 25] Liam: ""Anyway, anyone up for pizza tonight? Distract ourselves from all this.""
[Message 26] Chloe: ""Sounds good to me. I'm in.""
[Message 27] Maya: ""I can't tonight, have to work late. But thanks for the invite.""
[Message 28] David: ""Count me in for pizza. I'm starving.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Cool, so David and Chloe. I'll book a table.""
[Message 30] Maya: ""Have fun, guys. Be safe.""
[Message 31] Chloe: ""We will. You too, Maya.""
[Message 32] David: ""Yeah, later Maya.""
[Message 33] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 34] Chloe: ""So, David, what do you think really happened at Factory?""
[Message 35] David: ""Like I said, drug deal gone south. Alex was probably involved.""
[Message 36] Chloe: ""But a cop too? That’s weird.""
[Message 37] David: ""Maybe Alex was ratting people out. Cops don't just show up at a place like Factory for no reason.""
[Message 38] Chloe: ""True. It's all so messed up.""
[Message 39] David: ""You seem pretty shaken up, Chloe.""
[Message 40] Chloe: ""I just... I don't like violence. It scares me.""
[Message 41] David: ""Understandable. Me neither. Which is why you gotta be prepared to defend yourself, you know?""
[Message 42] Chloe: ""I guess so.""
[Message 43] Liam: ""Table's booked for 8. See you guys there.""
[Message 44] Chloe: ""Great! See you then.""
[Message 45] David: ""Alright, Liam.""
[Message 46] Maya: ""Hey Liam, quick question. Did Danny seem… angry or anything when you saw him?""
[Message 47] Liam: ""Nah, just his usual stressed self. Why?""
[Message 48] Maya: ""Just curious. Never mind.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""Okay... Everything alright, Maya?""
[Message 50] Maya: ""Yeah, just a long day. Thanks.""
[Message 51] Liam: ""No problem. See you later.""
[Message 52] Maya: ""Bye.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""Hey Liam, something's bugging me.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""What's up, Chloe?""
[Message 55] Chloe: ""David said he never liked Danny. He seems almost… happy about this whole thing.""
[Message 56] Liam: ""David's always been a bit of a hardass. Don't read too much into it.""
[Message 57] Chloe: ""Maybe you're right.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Besides, what could David possibly have to do with any of this?""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""I don't know. It's just a feeling.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Look, let's just try to have a good time tonight, okay? Forget about all this for a few hours.""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""Okay. You're right.""
[Message 62] David: ""Hey Maya, you heading home soon?""
[Message 63] Maya: ""Yeah, about to leave. Why?""
[Message 64] David: ""Just wondering if you needed a ride. It's not safe out there these days.""
[Message 65] Maya: ""Thanks, David, but I'm good. I have my pepper spray.""
[Message 66] David: ""Alright. Just be careful.""
[Message 67] Maya: ""Always am. You too.""
[Message 68] David: ""Later.""
[Message 69] Maya: ""Later.""
[Message 70] Chloe: ""Pizza was good, Liam. Thanks.""
[Message 71] Liam: ""No problem. Glad you enjoyed it.""
[Message 72] David: ""Yeah, appreciate it, man.""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Heard anything more about the Factory murders?""
[Message 74] Liam: ""Just the same stuff on the news. No suspects yet, apparently.""
[Message 75] David: ""They'll find whoever did it. They always do.""
[Message 76] Chloe: ""Hope so. It's scary thinking someone like that is out there.""
[Message 77] Liam: ""Speaking of scary, you guys see that horror movie trailer?""
[Message 78] David: ""Nah, what's it about?""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Some killer clown terrorizing a small town.""
[Message 80] Chloe: ""Sounds awful! I hate clowns.""
[Message 81] David: ""I'd watch it. Love a good scare.""
[Message 82] Liam: ""Maybe we can all go next week?""
[Message 83] Chloe: ""I'll pass. I’ll stick to rom-coms.""
[Message 84] David: ""Suit yourself. More popcorn for me.""
[Message 85] Maya: ""Hey guys, heard anything new about the case?""
[Message 86] Liam: ""Nothing. Still a mystery.""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""Nope. Just the same old news reports.""
[Message 88] David: ""Silence usually means they're onto something. They're probably building a case.""
[Message 89] Maya: ""Hope so. This is unsettling.""
[Message 90] Liam: ""Did you hear the manager, Alex, had debts?""
[Message 91] Chloe: ""No way! Where'd you hear that?""
[Message 92] Liam: ""Someone at the gym was talking about it. Said he owed some serious people money.""
[Message 93] David: ""See? Told you it was a deal gone wrong.""
[Message 94] Maya: ""That doesn't mean he deserved to die.""
[Message 95] Liam: ""Of course not. Just saying it adds up.""
[Message 96] Chloe: ""Still, it's awful.""
[Message 97] David: ""Life's awful. Get used to it.""
[Message 98] Maya: ""You okay, David? You seem extra cynical lately.""
[Message 99] David: ""Just tired of all the fake sympathy. People die. It happens.""
[Message 100] Maya: ""There's a difference between accepting death and being completely callous about it.""
[Message 101] David: ""Whatever, Maya. You always overthink things.""
[Message 102] Liam: ""Alright guys, let's not argue. We're all stressed out.""
[Message 103] Chloe: ""Yeah, let's just drop it.""
[Message 104] Maya: ""Fine.""
[Message 105] David: ""Good.""
[Message 106] Liam: ""Anyone need anything? I'm heading to the store.""
[Message 107] Chloe: ""Can you grab me some chocolate, please?""
[Message 108] Liam: ""Sure. Anything else?""
[Message 109] Chloe: ""Nope, that's it. Thanks, Liam.""
[Message 110] David: ""I'm good.""
[Message 111] Maya: ""No, thanks.""
[Message 112] Liam: ""Alright, be back in a bit.""
[Message 113] Chloe: ""Okay, bye.""
[Message 114] David: ""Later.""
[Message 115] Maya: ""Bye Liam.""
[Message 116] Maya: ""Chloe, can I ask you something privately?""
[Message 117] Chloe: ""Sure, what's up, Maya?""
[Message 118] Maya: ""Do you think David could be involved somehow? It's just a feeling I have.""
[Message 119] Chloe: ""I had that feeling too, at first. But Liam said we're overreacting.""
[Message 120] Maya: ""Maybe. But his reaction to the whole thing seems off. And that comment about needing to defend yourself...""
[Message 121] Chloe: ""I know, it was weird. But he's always been into that survivalist stuff.""
[Message 122] Maya: ""True. But still… keep an eye on him, okay?""
[Message 123] Chloe: ""I will. You too.""
[Message 124] Maya: ""Thanks, Chloe.""
[Message 125] Chloe: ""No problem. We gotta look out for each other.""
[Message 126] David: ""Hey, anyone seen my Using a garrote?""
[Message 127] Liam: ""Using a garrote? Why do you have one of those?""
[Message 128] David: ""Collecting old army gear. Just wondering where I put it.""
[Message 129] Chloe: ""That's... concerning, David.""
[Message 130] Maya: ""Yeah, maybe you should stick to collecting stamps.""
[Message 131] David: ""Relax, it's just a hobby.""
[Message 132] Liam: ""Well, try not to scare us, okay?""
[Message 133] David: ""Whatever.""
[Message 134] Maya: ""Have the police questioned any of you yet?""
[Message 135] Liam: ""Not me. I told you, I just picked up a package.""
[Message 136] Chloe: ""Not me either. I was at work all day.""
[Message 137] David: ""They talked to me for a bit. Just routine questions.""
[Message 138] Maya: ""What did they ask?""
[Message 139] David: ""Where I was, who I knew, the usual.""
[Message 140] Maya: ""Did you tell them about Danny?""
[Message 141] David: ""Yeah, I mentioned seeing him around.""
[Message 142] Maya: ""Okay.""
[Message 143] Liam: ""Alright, I'm back with the chocolate, Chloe.""

[Message 145] David: ""...""
[Message 146] Maya: ""Anyone know what the punishment is for something like this?""
[Message 147] Liam: ""Life in prison, probably. Maybe the death penalty.""
[Message 148] Chloe: ""That's awful. But they deserve it.""
[Message 149] David: ""They should bring back public executions. That would deter crime.""
[Message 150] Maya: ""David! That's barbaric.""
[Message 151] David: ""Just saying what I think.""

[Message 2] Ben: ""Tell me about it, Alex. Place was packed. I needed a drink after that.""
[Message 3] Casey: ""Yeah, too crowded for my taste. I left early.""
[Message 4] Dave: ""Early? I thought I saw you talking to Maya [Victim 1] around 10.""
[Message 5] Casey: ""Nah, must've been someone else. I was home by 9:30 watching Netflix.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Anyone know why the cops are all over Event Center today?""
[Message 7] Ben: ""No clue. Maybe a fight got out of hand? Happened before.""
[Message 8] Dave: ""Hope it's nothing serious.""
[Message 9] Casey: ""Probably just some drunk idiots. Anyway, anyone see that new Marvel movie?""
[Message 10] Alex: ""I heard it's great. We should all go sometime.""
[Message 11] Ben: ""Down. After this week, though. Swamped at work.""
[Message 12] Dave: ""Yeah, same here. Long hours.""
[Message 13] Casey: ""Okay, I’m free all week.""
[Message 14] Alex: ""Hey, anyone seen Ryan [Victim 2] around lately? Haven't seen him behind the bar.""
[Message 15] Ben: ""He seemed really down last week. Said he was having problems.""
[Message 16] Dave: ""Problems? What kind of problems?""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Didn't say. Just looked stressed. Probably just work stuff.""
[Message 18] Casey: ""Heard him and Maya [Victim 1] arguing a few days ago. Sounded pretty heated.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Arguing? About what?""
[Message 20] Casey: ""No idea. I just overheard snippets. Something about money, maybe?""
[Message 21] Dave: ""Money? Ryan [Victim 2] never seemed like he cared about money.""
[Message 22] Ben: ""Maybe Maya [Victim 1] did. Heard she had big plans. I intended to make it big, too.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Guys, cops just confirmed it's a double homicide at Event Center.""
[Message 24] Casey: ""What?! Seriously? That's insane.""
[Message 25] Ben: ""Double homicide? Who was killed?""

[Message 28] Casey: ""Oh my god. Maya [Victim 1]? I can't believe it.""
[Message 29] Ben: ""Ryan [Victim 2] too? That’s awful. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 30] Dave: ""This is horrible. I saw Ryan [Victim 2] leave the building at Evening.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Dave, you saw him leave? With who?""
[Message 32] Dave: ""Alone, as far as I could tell. He looked upset.""
[Message 33] Casey: ""I still can't believe it. Poor Maya [Victim 1]. She was always so optimistic.""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Yeah, it’s a shock. Especially Ryan [Victim 2] - he seemed so withdrawn lately.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""The news said it was Suffocation with a pillow.""
[Message 36] Casey: ""Suffocation with a pillow? That’s…brutal.""
[Message 37] Ben: ""Who would do something like that? He always hated 5.  Corrections Officer.""

[Message 39] Alex: ""The cops are asking questions. Anyone heard from them?""

[Message 41] Ben: ""They might be looking for anyone who knew them, maybe someone with a motive.""
[Message 42] Dave: ""I can't think of anyone who would want to hurt them. But who is to say, I didn't know them that well.""
[Message 43] Casey: ""Well, I am going to cooperate fully.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Guys, don't say anything to anyone until we talk to a lawyer. This could get messy.""
[Message 45] Ben: ""Good point, Alex. Lawyer up.""
[Message 46] Dave: ""I agree. I don't want to say anything that could be misinterpreted.""

[Message 49] Ben: ""He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""
[Message 50] Dave: ""Ben, what are you implying?""
[Message 51] Ben: ""Nothing, Dave. Just saying what I heard. He was buying Suffocation with a pillow at the store. But he also said that he only did it to protect his mother.""
[Message 52] Casey: ""I tried to talk him out of it.""
[Message 53] Dave: ""Casey, why didn't you call 911 after the victim was hurt, making the harm worse?""
[Message 54] Alex: ""Guys, stop. This isn't helping. Let's all just stay calm and cooperate with the police.""
[Message 55] Ben: ""Agreed. Let's just hope they find the real killer soon. I'm still reeling from this.""

[Message 2] Lex: Yeah, crazy. Old Man Hemlock, right?
[Message 3] River: Hemlock? The drug dealer? What happened?
[Message 4] Kai: Murdered. Hammer, apparently. Midday.
[Message 5] Quinn: OMG, that's awful! I was just there yesterday buying tomatoes.
[Message 6] Lex: Seriously? Hammer? That's brutal.
[Message 7] River: I heard Hemlock was dealing some heavy stuff. Probably ticked off the wrong people.
[Message 8] Kai: Maybe. Or maybe it was personal. He fired Bethany last month.
[Message 9] Bethany: WTF, Kai? You think I did it?
[Message 10] Kai: Just saying, motive, Bethany. You were furious.
[Message 11] Bethany: I was upset, sure, but murder? Seriously? I was with Ezra ALL day yesterday.
[Message 12] Ezra: Can confirm. We were binge-watching Star Trek.
[Message 13] Quinn: Bethany, you okay? This must be rough.
[Message 14] Bethany: I'm fine, Quinn. Just annoyed at Kai jumping to conclusions.
[Message 15] River: Lay off, Kai. It's a bit insensitive.
[Message 16] Lex: So, who else had beef with Hemlock? I heard he was screwing over some farmers.
[Message 17] Kai: Good point, Lex. He wasn't exactly a saint.
[Message 18] Quinn: This is just… I saw Officer Miller down there. It's serious.
[Message 19] River: Cops are probably talking to everyone who knew him.
[Message 20] Bethany: I hope they find who did this. Hemlock might have been a jerk, but he didn't deserve this.
[Message 21] Ezra: Poor guy.
[Message 22] Lex: Heard he stiffed Marco on a deal last week. Anyone know Marco?
[Message 23] Kai: Marco? Isn't he the one with the… religious views?
[Message 24] Quinn: Yeah, and he's got that weird intense stare. Makes me uncomfortable.
[Message 25] Marco: Leave me out of this, I was praying all day.
[Message 26] Bethany: Praying to what, Marco? The hammer gods?
[Message 27] Ezra: Bethany, dude, not cool.
[Message 28] Kai: Guys, let's not start pointing fingers. Let the police do their job.
[Message 29] Lex: True, true. Just brainstorming here. Wonder what Hemlock was up to that day?
[Message 30] River: Probably dealing. He always seemed anxious.
[Message 31] Quinn: I just feel so bad for his family.
[Message 32] Bethany: He didn't have any family. Just that mangy dog.
[Message 33] Ezra: That dog is gonna be lonely now.
[Message 34] Kai: Maybe he had more enemies than we knew.
[Message 35] Lex: Speaking of enemies, I saw River arguing with Hemlock last week. Something about ""promises.""
[Message 36] River: Lex, you’re imagining things. We just had a disagreement about prices.
[Message 37] Quinn: I thought I saw that too, River. You looked pretty heated.
[Message 38] River: Seriously guys? I sell flowers, I don't kill people. I have small hands anyway.
[Message 39] Bethany: Everyone's a suspect now, apparently.
[Message 40] Ezra: This is getting ridiculous.
[Message 41] Kai: Alright, alright. Let's change the subject. Anyone watching the game tonight?
[Message 42] Lex: Yeah, definitely. Need to take my mind off this.
[Message 43] River: I'm in. Anything is better than this conversation.
[Message 44] Quinn: Me too. Pizza at my place?
[Message 45] Bethany: Can't. Got that thing with Ezra.
[Message 46] Ezra: Yep, Trek marathon continues.
[Message 47] Marco: My prayers are with all of you.
[Message 48] Kai: Thanks, Marco. Appreciate it.
[Message 49] Lex: So, pizza at Quinn's. 7 pm?
[Message 50] River: Sounds good.
[Message 51] Quinn: Perfect. See you guys then.
[Message 52] Bethany: Still think I did it, Kai?
[Message 53] Kai: I didn't say that, Bethany. Just playing devil's advocate.
[Message 54] Lex: Anyone know what kind of hammer it was?
[Message 55] River: Why does that matter, Lex?
[Message 56] Lex: Just curious. Maybe it's a clue.
[Message 57] Quinn: Focus on happy thoughts, guys. Pizza soon!
[Message 58] Bethany: Happy thoughts are hard right now.
[Message 59] Ezra: I understand how you feel.
[Message 60] Kai: You think the cops will solve it quickly?
[Message 61] Lex: Depends. If they have solid evidence.
[Message 62] River: Or a good witness.
[Message 63] Quinn: I hope they don't drag this out.

[Message 70] Quinn: So scary to think something like that happened in our city.
[Message 71] Bethany: It is. Makes you wonder about people.
[Message 72] Ezra: True.
[Message 73] Kai: Someone like Hemlock probably made a lot of enemies. Maybe it was intended to happen.
[Message 74] Lex: Maybe. Or maybe it was random.
[Message 75] River: Hard to say.

[Message 79] Kai: I heard Hemlock recently got an expensive watch.
[Message 80] Lex: Probably fake. He always seemed shady.
[Message 81] River: Maybe that's what they were after.
[Message 82] Quinn: Or maybe they hated him.
[Message 83] Bethany: Or maybe he owed someone money.
[Message 84] Ezra: So many possibilities.

[Message 86] Kai: Exactly.
[Message 87] Lex: I am really hungry. Is it pizza time yet?

...","[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey Liam, you okay? Heard about what happened at Retail Store... crazy.
[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah Chloe, it's messed up. I was supposed to pick up a shift there next week.
[Message 3] CHLOE: Ugh, that's awful timing. Did you know either of the victims?
[Message 4] LIAM: Not really. I saw the security guard, Mark, around a few times. Seemed like a good dude. The Judge...was it Judge Thompson? I didn't know her.
[Message 5] CHLOE: Yeah, Thompson. Tragic.
[Message 6] NOAH: Yo Liam, you hear anything about this? They catch anyone?
[Message 7] LIAM: Nah, Noah. Just what's on the news. Super vague. You know anything?
[Message 8] NOAH: Just rumors. Heard some sketchy stuff went down that night.
[Message 9] CHLOE: Sketchy how? Spill the tea, Noah.
[Message 10] NOAH: Someone said they saw Alex near the store late, but Alex is always out late.
[Message 11] CHLOE: Alex? With the lip piercing? What time?
[Message 12] NOAH: Said it was around Predawn. But again, could be BS.
[Message 13] LIAM: Alex wouldn't hurt anyone. Right?
[Message 14] CHLOE: I don't know, Liam. They're always protesting *something*. Remember that time they glued themselves to City Hall?
[Message 15] NOAH: Yeah, Alex is intense. But murder? Dunno.
[Message 16] LIAM: I gotta go, guys. Mom needs help with groceries. Talk later.
[Message 17] CHLOE: Later, Liam.
[Message 18] NOAH: Peace.
[Message 19] LIAM: (To ANNA) Hey, you free to talk?
[Message 20] ANNA: (To LIAM) Just finished work. What's up?
[Message 21] LIAM: (To ANNA) You heard about Judge Thompson and Mark? At Retail Store?
[Message 22] ANNA: (To LIAM) Yeah, awful. What about it?
[Message 23] LIAM: (To ANNA) Noah said he heard Alex was near the store that night. Around Predawn.
[Message 24] ANNA: (To LIAM) Alex? Seriously? I thought they were all talk.
[Message 25] LIAM: (To ANNA) Me too. But it's weird, right?
[Message 26] ANNA: (To LIAM) Super weird. I saw Alex arguing with Judge Thompson once, outside the courthouse. Something about a ruling.
[Message 27] LIAM: (To ANNA) See? Maybe it *is* political.
[Message 28] ANNA: (To LIAM) Could be. Hey, I gotta run. Need to eat. Let's talk tomorrow?
[Message 29] LIAM: (To ANNA) Yeah, definitely.
[Message 30] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Did Liam seem off to you?
[Message 31] NOAH: (To CHLOE) Little bit. Why?
[Message 32] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Just seemed extra concerned about Alex. Like he was defending them too much.
[Message 33] NOAH: (To CHLOE) Maybe he's just trying to be fair.
[Message 34] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Maybe. Or maybe he knows something he's not telling us.
[Message 35] NOAH: (To CHLOE) What are you implying, Chloe?
[Message 36] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Nothing, nothing. Just thinking out loud.
[Message 37] NOAH: (To CHLOE) Right...
[Message 38] ALEX: (To SAM) Did you see what they're saying about me online?
[Message 39] SAM: (To ALEX) Yeah, it's messed up. People are jumping to conclusions.
[Message 40] ALEX: (To SAM) They're saying I killed Judge Thompson! Because I protested her once!
[Message 41] SAM: (To ALEX) I know, it's ridiculous. Where were you that night anyway?
[Message 42] ALEX: (To SAM) At home! Watching bad reality TV. You know me.
[Message 43] SAM: (To ALEX) Okay, just checking. The cops are probably going to want to know.
[Message 44] ALEX: (To SAM) Great. Just what I need.
[Message 45] NOAH: (To LIAM) Hey man, wanna grab a beer tonight?
[Message 46] LIAM: (To NOAH) Can't. Promised my aunt I'd help her with her taxes.
[Message 47] NOAH: (To LIAM) Right. Taxes. Sure.
[Message 48] NOAH: (To CHLOE) Liam bailed on me. Said he's doing taxes.
[Message 49] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Taxes? On a Tuesday night? Sus.
[Message 50] ANNA: (To LIAM) Hey, did you see that old Mr. Henderson died last week?
[Message 51] LIAM: (To ANNA) No way! Really? Poor guy.
[Message 52] ANNA: (To LIAM) Yeah, found him in his apartment. Sad.
[Message 53] LIAM: (To ANNA) Wow. That's...a lot to process.
[Message 54] ANNA: (To LIAM) I know, right? Anyway, about yesterday, maybe we should just stay out of it.
[Message 55] LIAM: (To ANNA) Stay out of...the Retail Store thing? Why?
[Message 56] ANNA: (To LIAM) It's not our business, Liam. Let the police handle it.
[Message 57] LIAM: (To ANNA) But what if Alex *did* do it? They could get away with it!
[Message 58] ANNA: (To LIAM) And what if they *didn't*? We could ruin their life. Just saying.
[Message 59] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Something's definitely up with Liam. He's avoiding me.
[Message 60] NOAH: (To CHLOE) Told you. He knows something.
[Message 61] SAM: (To ALEX) They found an Stabbing with an ice pick near the scene.
[Message 62] ALEX: (To SAM) An Stabbing with an ice pick? So? That doesn't mean anything!
[Message 63] SAM: (To ALEX) Just saying, it's not helping your case. Did you tell the cops about the protests?
[Message 64] ALEX: (To SAM) Of course not! Why would I bring that up?
[Message 65] SAM: (To ALEX) Because if they find out later, it'll look even worse.
[Message 66] ANNA: (To LIAM) I heard the security guard was trying to stop someone from stealing something that night. If he hadn't tried, maybe he'd still be alive.
[Message 67] LIAM: (To ANNA) So you think Mark was just in the wrong place at the wrong time? What about Judge Thompson?
[Message 68] ANNA: (To LIAM) Maybe she saw something she wasn't supposed to. Or maybe Alex had a legitimate reason. I don't know Liam, but they are going away for a long time for this.
[Message 69] NOAH: (To CHLOE) So, Liam's aunt confirmed he wasn't helping her with taxes.
[Message 70] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Called it! Where was he then...?

[Message 71] CHLOE: Why would he?
[Message 72] LIAM: It's not like they are boyfriend and girlfriend, right?
[Message 73] MAYA: Of course! We are talking about murder.
[Message 74] NOAH: I feel like maybe there are not enough evidences.
[Message 75] AVA: Maybe, but maybe there are.
[Message 76] CHLOE: I have some work to do.
[Message 77] LIAM: See ya guys.
[Message 78] MAYA: Bye.
[Message 79] NOAH: Bye Ava.
[Message 80] AVA: Bye Noah.
[Message 81] KAI: Hey Ava, you won't believe what's happening.
[Message 82] AVA: What's up, Kai?
[Message 83] KAI: The cops are all over me about the Community Center.
[Message 84] AVA: What?! Why?
[Message 85] KAI: Something about being a ""person of interest."" It's ridiculous!
[Message 86] AVA: Did you... were you even there that night?
[Message 87] KAI: No! I was at home, working on my videos. I swear!
[Message 88] AVA: Do you have any proof? Anyone who can vouch for you?
[Message 89] KAI: Ugh, no. I was alone. That's the problem.
[Message 90] AVA: Okay, okay, don't panic. Maybe we can figure something out.
[Message 91] KAI: What? What can we do?
[Message 92] AVA: I'll talk to my friend at the police station, see what they have on you.
[Message 93] KAI: Really? You'd do that for me?
[Message 94] AVA: Of course. But Kai, be honest with me. Did you see anything? Anything at all?
[Message 95] KAI: No! I swear, Ava. I wouldn't hurt anyone. Especially not Ashley.
[Message 96] AVA: What about Sarah? Did you know her?
[Message 97] KAI: I knew of her. From the Center. But that's it. Look, this is messing with my head. I need to focus on my career.
[Message 98] AVA: I understand. Just… try to stay calm. I'll call you later.
[Message 99] KAI: Thanks, Ava. You're the best.
[Message 100] AVA: Don't mention it.
[Message 101] NOAH: Ava, you there?
[Message 102] AVA: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 103] NOAH: So, Kai... you seem pretty concerned about him.
[Message 104] AVA: He's a friend, Noah. Of course I'm concerned.
[Message 105] NOAH: Right. Just... be careful. He's got a motive, you know? Revenge for a past wrong.
[Message 106] AVA: What are you talking about?
[Message 107] NOAH: I heard he and Ashley had a falling out a while back. Something about a project they were working on together.
[Message 108] AVA: I don't know anything about that.
[Message 109] NOAH: Just saying. Don't let your… feelings cloud your judgment.
[Message 110] AVA: My feelings? What feelings?
[Message 111] NOAH: Never mind. Just... watch your back.
[Message 112] AVA: I always do.
[Message 113] NOAH: Good.
[Message 114] KAI: Ava, I have to tell you something.
[Message 115] AVA: What is it, Kai? You're scaring me.
[Message 116] KAI: Remember how I said I was home all night?
[Message 117] AVA: Yes…?
[Message 118] KAI: I... I wasn't completely honest.
[Message 119] AVA: Where were you, Kai?
[Message 120] KAI: I went for a walk. I couldn't sleep.
[Message 121] AVA: And? Did you go anywhere near the Community Center?
[Message 122] KAI: ...I walked past it. But I didn't go inside. I swear!
[Message 123] AVA: Kai, you need to tell the police this.
[Message 124] KAI: No! They'll think I did it! I just... I just wanted to clear my head.
[Message 125] AVA: But if you're innocent, it'll help your case.
[Message 126] KAI: I don't know...
[Message 127] AVA: Kai, I'm trying to help you. But you need to be honest with me.
[Message 128] KAI: Okay, okay. I'll think about it.
[Message 129] AVA: Please do.
[Message 130] KAI: Thanks, Ava. You're a true friend.
[Message 131] AVA: Just be careful, okay? And tell me everything.
[Message 132] KAI: I will.
[Message 133] CHLOE: Hey Ava, any updates on Kai?
[Message 134] AVA: Nothing much, Chloe. He's still stressed.
[Message 135] CHLOE: He should be. You know, Ashley firing him from that project probably provoked him, right?
[Message 136] AVA: I don't know the details.
[Message 137] CHLOE: Well, that's what I heard. Anyway, gotta go. Good luck with everything.
[Message 138] AVA: Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 139] LIAM: Ava, you still talking to Kai?
[Message 140] AVA: Yeah, a little.
[Message 141] LIAM: Be careful, okay? Something about him doesn't sit right with me.
[Message 142] AVA: I will be. Thanks, Liam.
[Message 143] MAYA: Ava, you okay? You seem distracted.
[Message 144] AVA: I'm fine, Maya. Just tired.
[Message 145] MAYA: Alright. Just checking in. Don't let this whole thing consume you.

   • Gender: Transgender Male
   • Physique: Oval face
   • Occupation: Political assassination.

   • Cooperation with others
   • Knowledge of crime details
4. Make 30% of messages appear unrelated
5. Include subtle clues in 3 messages
6. Ensure all victims are mentioned by name or role (e.g., ""the manager"") at least once in the conversation.
7. **Incorporate at least 7 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Late Afternoon"", ""She was buying Explosive device at the store"").
        *   **Mens Rea:** Hints at the suspects' state of mind, intent, or knowledge (e.g., ""He always hated 5.  Corrections Officer"", ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""). Use words like ""intended,"" ""knew,"" ""aware,"" ""purposefully"".

8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

[Message 9] Casey: ""Kyle? I thought he was kinda cute, ngl lol.""
[Message 10] Riley: ""He was complaining about Amelia to me, something about her being unfair. Said she intentionally wrote him up for something.""
[Message 11] Jordan: ""See? Shifty. Wonder if he's involved. Dude probably intended to scare her.""
[Message 12] Casey: ""Riley, don't go spreading rumors. That's how innocent people get hurt.""
[Message 13] Riley: ""I'm not spreading rumors, just saying what I saw. He was looking up how to file a grievance online, but seemed really frustrated.""
[Message 14] Jordan: ""A grievance for what? Maybe he should have thought about his actions before yelling at her.""
[Message 15] Casey: ""Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. The police will figure it out. Did you guys see that new Marvel movie?""

[Message 19] Riley: ""Alex? The one with the acne scars? Weird.""
[Message 20] Jordan: ""He always seemed off. Remember when he said he wanted to 'get rid of' his neighbor? Joking, maybe, but still…""
[Message 21] Casey: ""Yeah, Alex is a little weird, but he's also really into those political activist groups. Maybe he had a reason to be there.""
[Message 22] Riley: ""Political assassination at an ice cream shop? That's a stretch, Casey.""
[Message 23] Jordan: ""Riley's right. He probably knew Sarah. He always glared at 5.  Corrections Officer. Makes you wonder about his state of mind.""
[Message 24] Casey: ""Guys, this is getting dark. I'm gonna go. Talk later.""
[Message 25] Riley: ""Okay, be safe. This whole thing is just messed up. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time.""
[Message 26] Jordan: ""Seriously. They deserve the worst. Catch you later, Riley.""
[Message 27] Riley: ""Later. By the way, anyone know a good plumber? My sink is leaking.""
[Message 28] Jordan: ""Nah, sorry. Maybe try Yelp?""
[Message 29] Riley: ""Good call.""
[Message 30] Casey: ""Hey, I'm back. Sorry, needed to clear my head. Maybe we shouldn't talk about this anymore until the police release something?""
[Message 31] Riley: ""Probably a good idea, Casey. It's just hard not to think about it.""
[Message 32] Jordan: ""Agreed. It's scary knowing something like that could happen so close to home. I heard Sarah was really anxious all the time too.""
[Message 33] Casey: ""Yeah, Amelia was always trying to calm her down.""
[Message 34] Riley: ""Okay, new topic. Anyone watching that new show on Netflix?""

[Message 41] Jordan: ""No way, I did not know that. That's terrible.""
[Message 42] Casey: ""Really? Poor Sarah. Maybe it was a mercy killing. I have heard stories about people who get so depressed they cant take it anymore.""
[Message 43] Riley: ""That's a really dark thought, Casey.""
[Message 44] Jordan: ""I think we are all on edge right now. Is there any information about the funeral?""
[Message 45] Casey: ""I don't know. I would feel weird attending.""
[Message 46] Riley: ""Me too. Let's just give the police some time to do their job.""
[Message 47] Jordan: ""Agreed. This whole thing is just messed up. I hope they catch whoever did this. They will probably get the death penalty.""
[Message 48] Casey: ""You are right, that person deserves the maximum punishment.""
[Message 49] Riley: ""Has anyone talked to Alex lately?""
[Message 50] Jordan: ""Nope, not since last week. Why?""

[Message 82] Leo: ""Could be important. Definitely tell the police that, Sam.""
[Message 83] Sam: ""She wasn't sure. Said it was someone from work, but she didn't know who. I will tell the cops.""
[Message 84] Maya: ""Someone from work? That narrows it down… a little.""

[Message 89] Chloe: ""Yeah, spill the tea.""
[Message 90] Leo: ""We're all ears.""
[Message 91] Sam: ""They're treating it as a missing person case for now, but they're definitely looking into the possibility of foul play.""
[Message 92] Maya: ""Foul play… I knew it. I just knew it.""
[Message 93] Chloe: ""Don't jump to conclusions, Maya. Let's wait for the facts.""
[Message 94] Leo: ""Yeah, we don't want to start pointing fingers without evidence.""
[Message 95] Sam: ""The detective asked me specifically where I was Late Afternoon last Tuesday.""
[Message 96] Maya: ""That's suspicious. Where *were* you?""
[Message 97] Chloe: ""Ooh, interrogation time.""
[Message 98] Leo: ""Haha, seriously, Sam. Where were you?""
[Message 99] Sam: ""I was at home, working. I had a massive deadline. I can prove it with timestamps on my files.""
[Message 100] Maya: ""Okay, good. Alibi confirmed.""
[Message 101] Chloe: ""Anyone else get the third degree?""
[Message 102] Leo: ""Not yet. Maybe I’m not interesting enough.""

[Message 104] Maya: ""I'm going to try to get some sleep. This is exhausting.""
[Message 105] Chloe: ""Night, Maya. Sweet dreams (hopefully).""
[Message 106] Leo: ""Sleep well. We're all here for you.""
[Message 107] Sam: ""Goodnight.""
[Message 108] Maya: ""Thanks, guys.""
[Message 109] Chloe: ""Did David ever mention anything about life insurance?""
[Message 110] Leo: ""That's a bit morbid, Chloe, don't you think?""
[Message 111] Sam: ""Yeah, kinda insensitive.""
[Message 112] Chloe: ""I'm just thinking practically. If something happened to him, who benefits? Money is a motive.""
[Message 113] Leo: ""True, but still… maybe focus on finding him first?""
[Message 114] Sam: ""I agree with Leo. Let’s not start planning his funeral yet.""
[Message 115] Chloe: ""Fair enough. Just saying, it’s something the police will probably look into anyway.""

[Message 117] Sam: ""Always.""
[Message 118] Maya: ""Pizza sounds good, actually. Comfort food.""
[Message 119] Chloe: ""I’m in. Let’s order a large.""

[Message 124] Leo: ""Oh my god, Maya, tell us!""
[Message 125] Sam: ""Please be okay…""
[Message 126] Maya: ""He's… he's dead. Someone pushed him off the top of the parking garage.""
[Message 127] Chloe: ""What?! No! This can't be happening.""
[Message 128] Leo: ""Oh no… I don't believe it.""
[Message 129] Sam: ""No way. Who would do that?""
[Message 130] Maya: ""They're calling it murder. They said he died at Late Afternoon.""
[Message 131] Chloe: ""Murder? Oh god, this is a nightmare. Poor David.""
[Message 132] Leo: ""This is awful. Absolutely awful. I can't even process this.""
[Message 133] Sam: ""Who would want to hurt him? This makes no sense.""
[Message 134] Maya: ""The detective just said he wanted to know if anyone knew that David hates heights and that he would never go up there willingly.""
[Message 135] Chloe: ""I can’t believe anyone would actually intentionally kill David. He didn’t deserve this.""
[Message 136] Leo: ""This is unreal. It's like something out of a movie. He just wanted to take care of his family. It’s not fair.""
[Message 137] Sam: ""Absolutely tragic. I'm completely numb. I intended on seeing him succeed.""
[Message 138] Maya: ""I’m so angry I could scream. The cops said someone used a falling object to make it look like suicide.""
[Message 139] Chloe: ""What will happen to the Anderson report? I really needed it.""
[Message 140] Leo: ""The Anderson report can wait, Chloe! Someone is dead!""
[Message 141] Sam: ""Seriously, Chloe? Show some respect.""
[Message 142] Chloe: ""I didn't mean it like that! I'm just stressed, okay? We're all stressed.""
[Message 143] Maya: ""They are pulling security footage and they know someone went up there with him around the time of the incident. He was also talking about getting rid of him at the time.""
[Message 144] Chloe: ""It could be anyone. There are lots of people who go up to that parking garage.""
[Message 145] Leo: ""I feel like I’m going to throw up. Is the person going to prison?""
[Message 146] Sam: ""A murder investigation? They’re going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 147] Maya: ""They will find out who did this and they will pay.""
[Message 148] Chloe: ""So what happens now?""
[Message 149] Leo: ""We grieve. We remember him. We help the police however we can.""
[Message 150] Sam: ""And we support each other. This is going to be tough.""
[Message 151] Maya: ""I don't know if I can face work tomorrow. Or ever.""
[Message 152] Chloe: ""Take the time you need, Maya. We understand.""
[Message 153] Leo: ""Yeah, don't worry about anything. Just focus on yourself.""
[Message 154] Sam: ""We'll cover for you. Just let us know what you need.""
[Message 155] Maya: ""Thank you. You guys are the best.""
[Message 156] Chloe: ""We’re a team, Maya. We stick together. The manager is going to have to understand""
[Message 157] Leo: ""Exactly. Always.""
[Message 158] Sam: ""For David.""
[Message 159] Maya: ""For David.""
[Message 160] Chloe: ""For David.""
[Message 161] Leo: ""Did anyone ever think David was weird?""
[Message 162] Sam: ""Sometimes, but in a good way. Creative. Unique.""
[Message 163] Maya: ""He was quirky, sure. But harmless. He loved his activist work""
[Message 164] Chloe: ""He never talked about his family much. Did anyone know he had a sister?""
[Message 165] Leo: ""I didn’t. Surprising, actually. You would figure that he would.""
[Message 166] Sam: ""It's hard to imagine.""
[Message 167] Maya: ""He kept mostly to himself. It's hard to imagine that someone purposefully hurt him.""
[Message 168] Chloe: ""Hope they don’t get the death penalty. Seems too harsh.""

[Message 10] Maya: ""David, don't start. Anyone could be. Focus on finding the guilty. ""
[Message 11] David: ""Just saying, Maya. People surprise you.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Did they release any details about the, you know...?""

[Message 16] Liam: ""I hope they catch whoever did this soon.""

[Message 19] David: ""Bright person? I barely knew him. Seemed kinda annoying, tbh.""
[Message 20] Maya: ""David! That's a horrible thing to say.""
[Message 21] David: ""What? Just being honest. Everyone's all saints now.""
[Message 22] Liam: ""Lay off, David. Now's not the time.""

[Message 27] Chloe: ""Smh. Some people...""
[Message 28] Maya: ""He's just trying to be edgy. Ignore him.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""You think he knows something we don't?""
[Message 30] Chloe: ""Nah, he's just insensitive. Probably playing video games right now.""
[Message 31] Maya: ""True. Anyway, did you see that new exhibit at the museum?""
[Message 32] Liam: ""No, tell me about it.""
[Message 33] Chloe: ""Speaking of exhibits, I wanted to go to the art fair next weekend. Anyone interested?""
[Message 34] Maya: ""I might be. Depends on my schedule.""
[Message 35] Liam: ""Sounds fun. I'm in.""
[Message 36] Chloe: ""Great! I'll make a group chat closer to the date.""
[Message 37] Maya: ""Sounds good.""
[Message 38] Liam: ""Cool. So, back to the museum...""
[Message 39] Chloe: ""Guys, I just saw something on Facebook. A woman named Sarah is claiming she saw someone matching David's description near the Hotel Lobby around Dawn.""
[Message 40] Maya: ""What?! Seriously?""
[Message 41] Liam: ""David? What was he doing there?""
[Message 42] Chloe: ""I don't know! The post is vague, but it's definitely about the murder.""
[Message 43] Maya: ""We need to ask him about this.""
[Message 44] Liam: ""I'll text him.""
[Message 45] Liam: ""David, hey. Saw a post about someone seeing someone who looks like you near the Hotel Lobby at Dawn. Care to explain?""
[Message 46] David: ""That's BS. I was home sleeping.""
[Message 47] Liam: ""Sarah seems pretty sure.""
[Message 48] David: ""Who the hell is Sarah? Never heard of her.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""Someone who lives in Flint. She said she saw you running away from the hotel at Dawn.""
[Message 50] David: ""Running? I haven't run anywhere in years. I have a bad knee!""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Just saying what she said.""
[Message 52] David: ""She's lying. Trying to stir up trouble. Tell her to get her facts straight.""
[Message 53] Liam: ""Alright, alright. Just wanted to hear your side.""
[Message 54] David: ""Seriously, this is ridiculous. I'm being accused of murder based on some random Facebook post?""
[Message 55] Liam: ""Nobody's accusing you, David. Just trying to understand.""
[Message 56] David: ""Yeah, well, understand this: I was asleep.""
[Message 57] Liam: ""Okay, I believe you.""
[Message 58] David: ""Good. Now leave me alone.""
[Message 59] Liam: ""Will do.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""He says he was home asleep. Claims it's all BS.""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""Hmmm. Seems defensive.""
[Message 62] Maya: ""Very. But he could be telling the truth. People make mistakes.""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""True. But that Sarah is pretty adamant.""
[Message 64] Maya: ""Maybe she saw someone else. Flint isn't exactly a small town.""
[Message 65] Liam: ""Yeah, could be.""
[Message 66] Chloe: ""Guys, I just remembered something. David HATED Alex. He always said Alex was a 'know-it-all'.""
[Message 67] Maya: ""Wait, seriously? I didn't know that.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""Me neither. That changes things.""
[Message 69] Chloe: ""He was always complaining about how Alex got a promotion he wanted.""
[Message 70] Maya: ""Okay, that's a motive. But still doesn't prove anything.""
[Message 71] Liam: ""True. But it makes him look a lot more suspicious.""
[Message 72] Chloe: ""Definitely. We should tell the police about this.""
[Message 73] Maya: ""Agreed. I'll call them.""
[Message 74] Liam: ""Let me know what they say.""
[Message 75] Chloe: ""Yeah, keep us updated.""
[Message 76] Maya: ""Okay, just got off the phone. They said they'll look into it. They're interviewing everyone who was at the hotel that night.""
[Message 77] Liam: ""Good. Hopefully, they'll find something.""
[Message 78] Chloe: ""Fingers crossed.""
[Message 79] Maya: ""So, about the art fair...""
[Message 80] Liam: ""Maybe we should hold off on that for now. Seems a little insensitive.""
[Message 81] Chloe: ""Yeah, you're right. Maybe another time.""
[Message 82] Maya: ""Agreed. We should focus on supporting Alex's family.""
[Message 83] Liam: ""Definitely. I'm sure they're going through hell.""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""I wonder if Alex had any enemies besides David.""
[Message 85] Maya: ""I don't know. He seemed like a pretty likeable person.""
[Message 86] Liam: ""Yeah, he did. Hard to imagine anyone wanting to hurt him.""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""Maybe it was a random act of violence.""
[Message 88] Maya: ""Could be. But it seems too targeted for that.""
[Message 89] Liam: ""Targeted how?""
[Message 90] Maya: ""Poisoning via inhalation like that... Seems planned, not spontaneous.""
[Message 91] Chloe: ""True. Someone knew what they were doing.""
[Message 92] Liam: ""Scary thought.""
[Message 93] Maya: ""Very.""
[Message 94] Chloe: ""Hey, did anyone see that new post from the manager of the hotel?""
[Message 95] Liam: ""No, what'd it say?""
[Message 96] Chloe: ""He said the security cameras were malfunctioning that night.""
[Message 97] Maya: ""Seriously? That's convenient.""
[Message 98] Liam: ""Conveniently suspicious.""
[Message 99] Chloe: ""Exactly! What are the odds?""
[Message 100] Maya: ""Maybe the manager is involved?""
[Message 101] Liam: ""Or covering for someone?""
[Message 102] Chloe: ""Or lying to protect the hotel's reputation?""
[Message 103] Maya: ""So many possibilities.""
[Message 104] Liam: ""We should tell the police about this too.""
[Message 105] Chloe: ""Already on it. Just sent them an email.""
[Message 106] Maya: ""Good work, Chloe.""
[Message 107] Liam: ""Thanks.""
[Message 108] Chloe: ""No problem. Just trying to help.""
[Message 109] Maya: ""We all are.""
[Message 110] Liam: ""So, what now? We wait?""
[Message 111] Chloe: ""Pretty much. Let the police do their job.""
[Message 112] Maya: ""Easier said than done.""
[Message 113] Liam: ""True.""
[Message 114] Chloe: ""Hey, I'm going to go for a walk. Need to clear my head.""
[Message 115] Maya: ""Okay, be careful.""
[Message 116] Liam: ""Yeah, stay safe.""
[Message 117] Chloe: ""Will do. Talk to you later.""
[Message 118] Maya: ""Bye.""
[Message 119] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 120] Liam: ""I keep thinking about Alex. Wonder what he was doing at the hotel so early?""
[Message 121] Maya: ""I have no idea. He was a 10. Social Worker, maybe he was helping someone there?""
[Message 122] Liam: ""Maybe. Or maybe he met someone there.""
[Message 123] Maya: ""Someone he knew? Or a stranger?""
[Message 124] Liam: ""So many questions.""
[Message 125] Maya: ""Too many. It's overwhelming.""
[Message 126] Liam: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 127] Maya: ""I just hope they find the person responsible. They're going away for a long time for this""
[Message 128] Liam: ""Me too. Justice for Alex.""
[Message 129] Maya: ""Absolutely.""
[Message 130] Liam: ""I'm going to try and get some sleep. This is exhausting.""
[Message 131] Maya: ""Yeah, me too. Night, Liam.""
[Message 132] Liam: ""Night, Maya.""
[Message 133] Maya: ""Actually, one more thing. Chloe mentioned David wanted a promotion Alex got, but I remember Chloe wanted that promotion too...just thinking out loud.""
[Message 134] Liam: ""Interesting...""
[Message 135] Liam: ""I didn't know that about Chloe. She seemed so upset. ""
[Message 136] Maya: ""People hide things, Liam. This case is a reminder of that.""
[Message 137] Liam: ""A harsh one for sure.""
[Message 138] Maya: ""I think so too.""
[Message 139] Liam: ""We should rest and see if the police catch the murderer.""
[Message 140] Maya: ""Yeah that sounds good. See you tomorrow.""

[Message 1] CHLOE: Did you hear about what happened at the Subway Station?
[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. What a mess.
[Message 3] CHLOE: I know, right? Security guard and some other dude. They said his name was Marcus.
[Message 4] AVA: Dayton is getting worse every day, I swear.
[Message 5] BEN: Tell me about it. Makes you wonder who's next.
[Message 6] LIAM: You guys going to Maria's party this weekend?
[Message 7] AVA: Probably. Need a distraction after this week.
[Message 8] BEN: I'm in. Need to forget about all this darkness.
[Message 9] CHLOE: I might skip it. Still shaken up.
[Message 10] LIAM: Suit yourself. More cake for us.
[Message 11] AVA: Did they say how they died?
[Message 12] BEN: Arson by setting a fire, apparently. Burned alive.
[Message 13] CHLOE: OMG! So terrible!
[Message 14] LIAM: Jesus. Harsh way to go.
[Message 15] AVA: I used to see that security guard all the time. Seemed like a quiet guy.
[Message 16] BEN: Maybe too quiet. You never know what people are hiding.
[Message 17] CHLOE: What do you mean?
[Message 18] BEN: Just saying, people aren't always who they seem.
[Message 19] LIAM: Deep thoughts, Ben.
[Message 20] AVA: Seriously. Anyway, who was the other guy?
[Message 21] CHLOE: Marcus, I think they said. Didn't know him.
[Message 22] BEN: Heard he was mixed up in some shady stuff.
[Message 23] LIAM: Like what?
[Message 24] BEN: Just rumors. Nothing concrete.
[Message 25] AVA: Still...makes you think.
[Message 26] CHLOE: Makes you think what?
[Message 27] AVA: Maybe he deserved it. I'm just saying.
[Message 28] LIAM: Whoa, Ava! That's cold.
[Message 29] BEN: Yeah, a little harsh.
[Message 30] AVA: Sorry, just saying, sometimes bad things happen to bad people.
[Message 31] CHLOE: Still doesn't make it okay.
[Message 32] LIAM: True. Alright, enough gloom. Maria's party – 8 PM, Saturday. Be there or be square.
[Message 33] BEN: Got it.
[Message 34] AVA: On it.
[Message 35] CHLOE: Okay, maybe I'll come after all. Need some cheering up.
[Message 36] LIAM: That's the spirit!
[Message 37] AVA: Did either of you guys know a Dakota?
[Message 38] BEN: Dakota? I don't think so.
[Message 39] LIAM: Nope. Why?
[Message 40] AVA: Just heard the police were asking around about someone named Dakota.
[Message 41] CHLOE: Maybe connected to the murders?
[Message 42] BEN: Could be.
[Message 43] LIAM: Damn, this is getting complicated.
[Message 44] AVA: I know, right?
[Message 45] CHLOE: So, what are we thinking for Maria's gift?
[Message 46] LIAM: Gift card?
[Message 47] BEN: Classic.
[Message 48] AVA: Boring. Let's get her something fun.
[Message 49] CHLOE: Like what?
[Message 50] AVA: I don't know! That's why I'm asking you guys!
[Message 51] LIAM: Relax, Ava. We'll figure it out.
[Message 52] BEN: Hey, Chloe, you okay? You've been quiet.
[Message 53] CHLOE: Just thinking. This whole thing is messed up.
[Message 54] LIAM: Yeah, it is.
[Message 55] AVA: We should all try to stick together, you know?
[Message 56] BEN: Definitely.
[Message 57] CHLOE: Agreed.
[Message 58] LIAM: So, gift ideas? Anyone?
[Message 59] AVA: Massage certificate?
[Message 60] BEN: Not bad.
[Message 61] CHLOE: I like it.
[Message 62] LIAM: Okay, massage certificate it is.
[Message 63] AVA: Cool.
[Message 64] BEN: I'll pick it up tomorrow.
[Message 65] CHLOE: Thanks, Ben.
[Message 66] LIAM: Appreciate it, man.
[Message 67] AVA: So, back to the murders... you think they'll catch who did it?
[Message 68] BEN: Hope so.
[Message 69] CHLOE: For sure.
[Message 70] LIAM: They have to.
[Message 71] AVA: I heard the Security Guard, his name was David, had some enemies.
[Message 72] BEN: Oh yeah? Who?
[Message 73] AVA: Just office gossip, you know? Someone he fired.
[Message 74] CHLOE: Could be a lead.
[Message 75] LIAM: The cops should check it out.
[Message 76] BEN: They probably are.
[Message 77] AVA: Remember that time Maria set her hair on Arson by setting a fire trying to light a birthday candle?
[Message 78] CHLOE: LOL! Oh my god, yes!
[Message 79] LIAM: I missed that!
[Message 80] BEN: Classic Maria.
[Message 81] AVA: She was so mad!
[Message 82] CHLOE: Good times.
[Message 83] LIAM: Okay, back to serious. Anyone need a ride to the party?
[Message 84] BEN: I'm good.
[Message 85] AVA: Me too.
[Message 86] CHLOE: I might need one.
[Message 87] LIAM: I'll pick you up, Chloe.
[Message 88] CHLOE: Thanks, Liam.
[Message 89] AVA: Speaking of fire...anyone know where I can get some good deals on candles?
[Message 90] BEN: Random.
[Message 91] LIAM: Amazon?
[Message 92] CHLOE: Bath & Body Works?
[Message 93] AVA: Good idea.
[Message 94] BEN: This conversation is all over the place.
[Message 95] LIAM: Tell me about it.
[Message 96] CHLOE: Welcome to our lives.
[Message 97] AVA: Haha!
[Message 98] BEN: I'm heading out. See you guys Saturday.
[Message 99] LIAM: Later, man.
[Message 100] CHLOE: Bye, Ben.
[Message 101] AVA: See ya.
[Message 102] LIAM: So, Chloe, you really shaken up?
[Message 103] CHLOE: Yeah, honestly. It's creeping me out.
[Message 104] AVA: Me too. I keep thinking about what could have happened if the fire spread.
[Message 105] LIAM: Don't go there.
[Message 106] CHLOE: Easier said than done.
[Message 107] AVA: Remember that guy, Marcus, that got fired last month? He always hated David. He literally told me ""I will get rid of him""
[Message 108] LIAM: Really? You should tell the cops that, Ava.
[Message 109] CHLOE: Definitely. That's important.
[Message 110] AVA: I will. Just... scared, you know?
[Message 111] LIAM: I get it. But you have to.
[Message 112] CHLOE: Ava is right, Liam.
[Message 113] AVA: Ugh, you're right.
[Message 114] LIAM: Good. Stay safe, you two.
[Message 115] CHLOE: You too, Liam.
[Message 116] AVA: Yeah. Later.
[Message 117] CHLOE: Did you ever talk to Dakota?
[Message 118] LIAM: Dakota? No why?
[Message 119] CHLOE: Someone told me they looking for Dakota to punish the ones that they feel caused the incident.
[Message 120] LIAM: Wow, this is getting out of control!
[Message 121] CHLOE: Yep.
[Message 122] AVA: Hey guys. Just gave my statement to the police.
[Message 123] BEN: Good for you.
[Message 124] CHLOE: Awesome.
[Message 125] LIAM: That's the right thing to do.
[Message 126] AVA: I feel a little better now.
[Message 127] BEN: What did they ask you?
[Message 128] AVA: Just about what I knew about Marcus and David.
[Message 129] CHLOE: Did you tell them about Marcus hating David?
[Message 130] AVA: Of course.
[Message 131] LIAM: Hopefully, that helps.
[Message 132] BEN: Anyway, who is bringing the drinks to Marias party?
[Message 133] CHLOE: Ill buy
[Message 134] AVA: Awesome!
[Message 135] LIAM: I can bring some snacks.

[Message 137] CHLOE: Perfect! Its gonna be awesome!
[Message 138] AVA: Yes!
[Message 139] LIAM: Lets hope they dont get the death penalty!
[Message 140] BEN: Thats true
[Message 141] CHLOE: So scary!
[Message 142] AVA: Maybe it was for self-defense.
[Message 143] BEN: You never know
[Message 144] LIAM: Guys! Stop with that talk!
[Message 145] CHLOE: Sorry.
[Message 146] AVA: Sorry.
[Message 147] BEN: Did you ever see Dakota buying arson by setting a fire at the store, Ava?
[Message 148] CHLOE: Why do you ask?
[Message 149] LIAM: Weird question man.
[Message 150] AVA: I have never seen Dakota ever.
[Message 151] BEN: Just thought you did since you saw him mad.
[Message 152] CHLOE: That is a red flag.
[Message 153] LIAM: What?
[Message 154] AVA: What did you see Ben?
[Message 155] BEN: Nothin!
[Message 156] CHLOE: Youre sus!

7. **Incorporate at least 7 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Early Hours"", ""She was buying Shooting with a handgun at the store"").
        *   **Mens Rea:** Hints at the suspects' state of mind, intent, or knowledge (e.g., ""He always hated 4.  Journalist"", ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""). Use words like ""intended,"" ""knew,"" ""aware,"" ""purposefully"".
        *   **Concurrence:** Implied connections between actions and intent (e.g., ""He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there"").
        *   **Causation:** Statements that link a suspect's actions to the victim's harm (e.g., ""If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened"", ""Her shouting probably provoked him""). Try to have an intervening cause, like failure to call 911 after the victim was hurt, making the harm worse.
        *   **Attempt:** Allusions to preparatory acts or failed attempts (e.g., ""He was looking up how to make Shooting with a handgun online"", ""She tried to talk him out of it"").
        *   **Attendant/Extenuating Circumstances:** References to factors that could influence culpability (e.g., victim's age in a statutory rape hypothetical, potential self-defense claims, evidence of duress, victim's own aggression leading to the crime.)
8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

[Message 56] Maya: ""Exactly. And Mark, the law enforcement officer, he was just doing his job.""

[Message 79] Noah: ""Yeah, what did they say?""
[Message 80] Daniel: ""They probably got a suspect in mind. Cops always do.""

[Message 111] Chloe: ""I'm going to try to get some sleep. This has been too much.""

[Message 113] Maya: ""Sleep tight.""
[Message 114] Noah: ""Take care.""
[Message 115] Daniel: ""Night.""
[Message 116] Liam: ""Anyone else find it weird that Daniel was so quick to blame Sarah?""
[Message 117] Maya: ""Yeah, it was kinda off-putting. He always hated journalists.""
[Message 118] Noah: ""Maybe he knew something he wasn't telling us.""
[Message 119] Daniel: ""What’s off putting is how Sarah was trying to make the police look bad.""
[Message 120] Liam: ""Or maybe he's just being Daniel.""
[Message 121] Maya: ""True. But still...""
[Message 122] Noah: ""Let's not jump to conclusions. But keep it in mind.""
[Message 123] Liam: ""Okay.""
[Message 124] Maya: ""Agreed.""
[Message 125] Daniel: ""If she wasn’t trying to play hero maybe she’d still be alive.""

[Message 127] Liam: ""Night, Noah.""
[Message 128] Maya: ""Goodnight.""
[Message 129] Daniel: ""Night.""
[Message 130] Liam: ""Maya, do you remember anything specific about when you saw Jamie and Mark talking?""
[Message 131] Maya: ""It was a few weeks ago at that coffee shop near the park. They seemed to be arguing actually. Jamie seemed really angry.""
[Message 132] Liam: ""Damn. That's worth telling the cops.""
[Message 133] Daniel: ""Wonder what they were arguing about.""
[Message 134] Maya: ""I don't know. I couldn't hear what they were saying.""
[Message 135] Liam: ""Okay, good to know. I'm going to try and get some sleep too.""
[Message 136] Maya: ""Me too. Night.""
[Message 137] Liam: ""Night.""
[Message 138] Daniel: ""Later.""
[Message 139] Chloe: ""I just remembered something... Sarah mentioned she was meeting someone at the park that night. She wouldn't say who.""
[Message 140] Liam: ""Damn, Chloe. That's HUGE.""
[Message 141] Maya: ""Definitely tell the police that ASAP.""
[Message 142] Noah: ""Wow, that changes everything.""
[Message 143] Daniel: ""Probably a secret lover or something. This just got interesting.""
[Message 144] Chloe: ""I already told them. They seemed interested.""
[Message 145] Liam: ""Good. I hope they catch this maniac.""
[Message 146] Maya: ""Me too. This is so heartbreaking.""
[Message 147] Noah: ""Hopefully they find out who it was soon.""
[Message 148] Daniel: ""I knew it. Sarah was playing with fire. Probably had it coming.""
[Message 149] Chloe: ""What is wrong with you, Daniel?""
[Message 150] Liam: ""Seriously, Daniel. Shut up.""
[Message 151] Maya: ""You're disgusting.""
[Message 152] Noah: ""Unbelievable.""
[Message 153] Daniel: ""What? Just being realistic.""
[Message 154] Chloe: ""I'm done with this conversation.""
[Message 155] Liam: ""Yeah, me too.""
[Message 156] Maya: ""Good riddance.""
[Message 157] Noah: ""Unfollowing.""
[Message 158] Daniel: ""Fine by me. You all are too sensitive.""
[Message 159] Liam: ""Did anyone notice Daniel didn't seem surprised? Like he intended Sarah was gonna die?""
[Message 160] Maya: ""Now that you mention it... he did seem a little too calm. Knew she was doing journalism.""
[Message 161] Noah: ""He said he moved away from the park because it's too dangerous. Maybe he was aware of Sarah's intentions to meet with someone.""
[Message 162] Liam: ""I saw Daniel at the gun store buying Shooting with a handgun a week ago.""
[Message 163] Maya: ""Oh my god. This is getting scary. He's wanted to get rid of him.""
[Message 164] Noah: ""Maybe he and Jamie conspired. Or maybe Daniel and Jamie knew about the meet-up, and decided to take matters into their own hands.""
[Message 165] Liam: ""We should call the police. Like, now.""
[Message 166] Maya: ""Absolutely. This is beyond messed up.""
[Message 167] Noah: ""Agreed. I'm calling right now.""
[Message 168] Liam: ""Stay safe, you two.""
[Message 169] Maya: ""You too. This is insane.""
[Message 170] Liam: ""They were talking about hurting her right before he went over there""

[Message 2] Fatima: Yeah, crazy. Old Mrs. Davies, right? The security guard?
[Message 3] Omar: Yeah, terrible.
[Message 4] Fatima: Poor woman. What happened exactly?
[Message 5] Omar: Word is, some kind of poisoning.
[Message 6] Fatima: Poisoning? At the Mosque? Who would do that?
[Message 7] Omar: No clue. The cops are all over it.
[Message 8] Fatima: I saw them hauling someone out earlier. Looked young.
[Message 9] Omar: Really? Who?
[Message 10] Fatima: Couldn't tell. Covered their face. Heard it might be Kai.
[Message 11] Omar: Kai? Seriously? That doesn't sound right.
[Message 12] Fatima: I know, right? Seemed quiet. But they did have that argument with Mrs. Davies last week.
[Message 13] Omar: About what?
[Message 14] Fatima: Something about fundraising for the new community center. Mrs. Davies wasn't happy with how Kai was handling it.
[Message 15] Omar: Still, murder? Seems extreme.
[Message 16] Fatima: Agreed. Maybe it's a mistake.
[Message 17] Omar: Hope so. Anyway, you still coming to dinner tomorrow?
[Message 18] Fatima: Yeah, wouldn't miss it. Need a distraction after all this.
[Message 19] Omar: Perfect. I'm making lasagna.
[Message 20] Fatima: Yum! Can I bring anything?
[Message 21] Omar: Just yourself!
[Message 22] Fatima: Okay! See you then.
[Message 23] Omar: Later.
[Message 24] Kai: This is insane. They arrested me.
[Message 25] Ahmed: What? Kai, what happened?
[Message 26] Kai: That Mrs. Davies is dead. They think I did it.
[Message 27] Ahmed: What? How? Why would they think that?
[Message 28] Kai: Something about poison. I swear I didn't do anything.
[Message 29] Ahmed: Where were you last night?
[Message 30] Kai: At home! Playing video games! You know I always do that on Wednesdays.
[Message 31] Ahmed: Did anyone see you?
[Message 32] Kai: No. I was alone. Crap.
[Message 33] Ahmed: Okay, don't panic. Get a lawyer.
[Message 34] Kai: I can't afford one.
[Message 35] Ahmed: I'll help you find someone pro bono. Just tell them everything.
[Message 36] Kai: I will. Thanks, Ahmed. I'm so scared.
[Message 37] Ahmed: It'll be okay. We'll figure this out. Remember that time we got blamed for toilet papering Mrs. Henderson's house? This is worse, but same principle.
[Message 38] Kai: This isn't the same, Ahmed! This is MURDER.
[Message 39] Ahmed: I know, I know. Just trying to lighten the mood. I'm on my way. Don't say anything else to the cops.
[Message 40] Kai: Okay. Hurry.
[Message 41] Layla: Heard about Mrs. Davies. Tragic.
[Message 42] David: Yeah, awful. Such a sweet lady.
[Message 43] Layla: Did you see Kai was arrested?
[Message 44] David: I did. Seems… unlikely. But they did argue.
[Message 45] Layla: Everyone argues sometimes. Doesn't make you a murderer.
[Message 46] David: True. Did you see anything unusual last night?
[Message 47] Layla: Nope. I was home all night, binge-watching that true crime show. How ironic.
[Message 48] David: Haha. Me too, actually. Which one?
[Message 49] Layla: ""Night Stalker."" So creepy.
[Message 50] David: Good choice. Hey, this is going to sound weird, but did you ever see Kai acting strangely around Mrs. Davies? Maybe a little *too* helpful?
[Message 51] Layla: Now that you mention it, they did bring her tea every afternoon. Maybe they intended to get rid of her.
[Message 52] David: Maybe. Just trying to piece things together. Something feels off.
[Message 53] Layla: I understand. Keep me posted.
[Message 54] David: Will do.
[Message 55] Omar: Hey, any updates on the Davies case?
[Message 56] Fatima: Just that Kai is still in custody. Apparently, they found traces of some kind of poison in their apartment.
[Message 57] Omar: Seriously? That's… damning.
[Message 58] Fatima: Yeah. Looks bad.
[Message 59] Omar: I still find it hard to believe.
[Message 60] Fatima: Me too. But the evidence is mounting.
[Message 61] Omar: Maybe they were framed?
[Message 62] Fatima: Possible, but who would do that?
[Message 63] Omar: No idea. It's all so messed up. Hey, did you hear back from the landlord about the broken faucet?
[Message 64] Fatima: Ugh, not yet. I'm going to call them again tomorrow.
[Message 65] Omar: Annoying. I can take a look at it if you want.
[Message 66] Fatima: You're a lifesaver! I'll take you up on that.
[Message 67] Omar: Anytime.
[Message 68] Kai: They think I planned this!
[Message 69] Ahmed: Relax, Kai. They have to prove it.
[Message 70] Kai: But what if they can't? What if they just want someone to blame? I heard the punishment is life in prison.
[Message 71] Ahmed: Don't think like that. The lawyer said we have a strong alibi case. Playing video games all night isn't exactly suspicious.
[Message 72] Kai: But they found poison in my apartment! I don't even know where it came from!
[Message 73] Ahmed: Someone could have planted it. We'll figure it out. Did you mention to the police that Mrs. Davies provoked you by shouting at you and calling you names?
[Message 74] Kai: No, should I have? I was too freaked out.
[Message 75] Ahmed: Yes! It shows she was aggressive. Maybe she had a heart attack after the argument!
[Message 76] Kai: Oh god, what if she did? And I didn't call 911?
[Message 77] Ahmed: That's not your fault! You didn't know she was dying.
[Message 78] Kai: This is a nightmare.
[Message 79] Ahmed: We'll get through it.
[Message 80] David: Hey Layla, something's bugging me.
[Message 81] Layla: What's that?
[Message 82] David: Remember you said you were watching ""Night Stalker""?
[Message 83] Layla: Yeah?
[Message 84] David: That's weird. The internet was down all night. How could you stream it?
[Message 85] Layla: Oh... I meant, I had it downloaded already. From before.
[Message 86] David: Right. Sure.
[Message 87] Layla: What are you implying?
[Message 88] David: Nothing. Just seems odd. You knew Mrs. Davies pretty well, right?
[Message 89] Layla: We chatted sometimes. She was nice. But I didn't *know* her.
[Message 90] David: She mentioned you were having financial problems recently.
[Message 91] Layla: That's none of her business.
[Message 92] David: Did she offer to help?
[Message 93] Layla: Maybe. What's your point?
[Message 94] David: Just trying to understand why someone might want her gone. And why they might buy Poisoning via inhalation at the store.
[Message 95] Layla: I think you are wrong.
[Message 96] Omar: So, did you fix the faucet?
[Message 97] Fatima: Yeah, thanks to you! Working perfectly now.
[Message 98] Omar: Great! Glad I could help. Anything else I can do?
[Message 99] Fatima: Maybe… do you know anything about making homemade cleaners?
[Message 100] Omar: A little. Why?
[Message 101] Fatima: Just curious. Trying to be more eco-friendly.
[Message 102] Omar: There are tons of recipes online. Be careful mixing chemicals, though.
[Message 103] Fatima: I will be. Thanks for the tip.
[Message 104] Omar: No problem. Hey, I'm heading to the Mosque tomorrow. Wanna come?
[Message 105] Fatima: I appreciate the invite but can't make it. I need to run errands.
[Message 106] Omar: Okay, another time.
[Message 107] Fatima: Definitely.
[Message 108] Ahmed: I'm telling you, Kai, Layla has a motive. Financial trouble, and she knew Mrs. Davies.
[Message 109] Kai: But why would she plant poison in *my* apartment?
[Message 110] Ahmed: To make it look like you did it! She knew you had a disagreement with Mrs. Davies. It's the perfect setup. Think about it – she was talking about hurting her right before she went over there and brought her tea every afternoon.

...","[Message 1] Chloe: Hey everyone, did you hear about what happened at the ATM near uptown?

[Message 2] Ben: Yeah, crazy stuff. A judge, right? Judge Thompson?

[Message 3] Chloe: Yeah, Thompson. Awful.

[Message 4] Alex: I was near there this Afternoon, saw a lot of police. Scary.

[Message 5] David: Same here, on my way to get lunch. Did they say what happened?

[Message 6] Chloe: Heard it was… an accident. Something falling?

[Message 7] Ben: An accident? Someone dropping something heavy? Sounds weird.

[Message 8] David: So sad. He was such a nice man, always smiling.

[Message 9] Alex: Smiling on the way to ruin people's lives with his sentencing lol. Jk jk… kinda.

[Message 10] Chloe: Alex! That's a terrible thing to say, even as a joke.

[Message 11] Alex: Sorry, sorry. Just saying, not everyone loved him.

[Message 12] Ben: True. But still…dead is dead.

[Message 13] David: Anyone know the details?

[Message 14] Chloe: Just what I heard on the news.

[Message 15] Ben: I heard someone saw a Transgender Male running away from the scene.

[Message 16] Alex: Wow, Ben, that's quite a specific detail. Where’d you hear that?

[Message 17] Ben: One of my neighbors is a cop.

[Message 18] David: A Transgender Male? That’s… strange.

[Message 19] Chloe: It's just a description, David. Don't be weird.

[Message 20] Alex: Yeah, anyone can be a criminal.

[Message 21] Ben: Exactly. Anyway, anyone up for pizza tonight? Needs a distraction from all this.

[Message 22] Chloe: I'm in.

[Message 23] David: Me too.

[Message 24] Alex: Sure, why not.

[Message 25] Chloe: Pizza at Ben's?

[Message 26] Ben: Yep! 7 PM.

[Message 27] Alex: Cool.

[Message 28] David: See you guys then.

[Message 29] Chloe: See ya.

[Message 30] Alex: Just remembered, I have to grab something from Home Depot first. Be a little late.

[Message 31] Ben: No worries.

[Message 32] David: Grab me a new hammer while you're there?

[Message 33] Alex: Haha, sure thing, David. If they have any left after I'm done.

[Message 34] Chloe: What do you need at Home Depot, Alex?

[Message 35] Alex: Just some stuff for my garden.

[Message 36] Chloe: Ah, gotcha.

[Message 37] Ben: Did you guys see that Thompson had some pretty high profile cases recently?

[Message 38] David: Yeah, I think I read something about that. One was getting a lot of press.

[Message 39] Chloe: Maybe someone he sentenced wanted revenge.

[Message 40] Alex: Could be. People hold grudges.

[Message 41] Ben: They're going away for a long time for this. I'd hate to be in their shoes.

[Message 42] David: Poor man's family. So sad.

[Message 43] Chloe: Absolutely heartbreaking.

[Message 44] Alex: Okay, gotta run. See you guys later.

[Message 45] Ben: Later, Alex!

[Message 46] David: Bye.

[Message 47] Chloe: See ya.

[Message 48] David: Ben, did you hear about what happened to Sarah's dog?

[Message 49] Ben: No! What happened?

[Message 50] David: Got hit by a car. Poor thing.

[Message 51] Ben: Oh no, that's awful!

[Message 52] Chloe: Guys, back to Thompson for a sec – I saw something online about him being pretty harsh in court. Maybe someone snapped.

[Message 53] David: He was known to be tough.

[Message 54] Ben: Tough but fair, I always thought.

[Message 55] Alex: (Arriving late to pizza) Sorry I'm late, Home Depot was a zoo. They didn't have the hammer, David.

[Message 56] David: No worries.

[Message 57] Chloe: Hey, Alex, you okay? You seem a little…off.

[Message 58] Alex: Just tired. Long day.

[Message 59] Ben: Did you manage to get all your gardening stuff?

[Message 60] Alex: Yeah, all good. Ready for pizza.

[Message 61] David: So, any more news about Thompson?

[Message 62] Ben: Not that I've heard. Just the initial reports.

[Message 63] Chloe: It's all over the news. They’re really investigating.

[Message 64] Alex: Hope they find who did it. They deserve everything they get.

[Message 65] David: Amen to that.

[Message 66] Ben: Agreed.

[Message 67] Chloe: Guys, I'm gonna head out. Early start tomorrow.

[Message 68] Ben: Okay, Chloe. See ya!

[Message 69] David: Bye Chloe.

[Message 70] Alex: Night.

[Message 71] Ben: David, you staying for another slice?

[Message 72] David: Sure, why not.

[Message 73] Ben: So, you think they'll catch the Transgender Male?

[Message 74] David: I hope so. It's scary to think someone like that is out there. The shouting probably provoked him.

[Message 75] Ben: Yeah, scary indeed.

[Message 4] Alex: Dusk? That's when I saw Jesse leave that area. Coincidence?

[Message 5] Jordan: Jesse? He wouldn't do something like that. He's always seemed chill.

[Message 13] Jordan: An inhaler? Lots of people have those in Nashville, especially with the allergies right now.

[Message 14] Kai: True. But still… poor 7.  Activist. She was just trying to make a difference.

[Message 17] Kai: Agreed. Let's not jump to conclusions. The police will figure it out.

[Message 18] Alex: Hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 19] Jordan: It's probably some random act of violence, you know? Wrong place, wrong time. I hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 20] Kai: Let’s hope so. Hey, are either of you free for coffee tomorrow? Need to get my mind off this.

[Message 21] Alex: I'm in. Need a distraction too.

[Message 22] Jordan: Me too. See you both then.

[Message 23] Kai: Great. So, back to the Taxi Stand... any more news?

[Message 24] Alex: Just rumors. Someone said Marie was buying some weird stuff at the store that day. Poisoning via inhalation, specifically.

[Message 25] Jordan: Seriously? She was probably just buying stuff for her garden!

[Message 26] Kai: Guys, let’s not spread gossip. Wait for the official investigation. This could have been an intended poisoning.

[Message 27] Alex: Right, right. Just saying what I heard.

[Message 28] Jordan: I saw Jesse trying to fix something in his car that day. Could be relevant? He was getting pretty frustrated. Actus Reus?

[Message 29] Kai: Maybe. Or maybe his car was just being a pain. Nashville traffic can do that to anyone.

[Message 30] Alex: True. Speaking of cars, I need to get mine serviced. Anyone know a good mechanic?

[Message 31] Jordan: Try Tony's on Demonbreun. He's honest.

[Message 32] Kai: Okay, thanks. Back to Jesse and Marie... is there anything else either of you remember? Anything at all?

[Message 33] Alex: Just that Jesse seemed unusually quiet lately. Like he was planning something. Causation?

[Message 34] Jordan: Maybe he was just stressed about work. We all get stressed.

[Message 35] Kai: I guess so. Well, see you both tomorrow for coffee. Let's try to talk about something else, okay?

...","[Message 1] Liam: Hey everyone, did you hear about what happened at Skate Park?

[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, it's awful. So sad about Casey.

[Message 3] Chloe: Unbelievable. I can't believe it. How did it even happen?

[Message 4] Noah: Apparently a car accident. Pretty messed up.

[Message 5] Olivia: Oh my god, that's terrible. Casey was always so nice to me when I visited.

[Message 6] Liam: Yeah, she was a good bartender. Always quick with a joke.

[Message 7] Maya: I saw her buying something at the store Dusk just before it happened. Is it a coincidence?

[Message 8] Chloe: Seriously? That's freaky, Maya.

[Message 9] Noah: Freaky indeed. I was supposed to meet Casey there that night, but I bailed last minute.

[Message 10] Olivia: Wow, Noah, you dodged a bullet.

[Message 11] Liam: Anyone know anything more about what happened? The news is vague.

[Message 12] Maya: Just that it was a hit and run. Cops are looking for the driver.

[Message 13] Chloe: Hope they catch the scum. I am so angry!

[Message 14] Noah: Me too, Chloe. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 15] Olivia: It makes me sick to my stomach.

[Message 16] Liam: Alright, alright, let's not dwell on it too much. What are we all doing tonight? Need a distraction.

[Message 17] Maya: I'm thinking of just staying in. This whole thing has me rattled.

[Message 18] Chloe: Same. Maybe a movie night?

[Message 19] Noah: Count me in for a movie. Pizza too?

[Message 20] Olivia: I'm in! Pizza sounds amazing.

[Message 21] Liam: Perfect. My place, 7 PM?

[Message 22] Maya: Sounds good. See you all then.

[Message 23] Chloe: See ya.

[Message 24] Noah: Later.

[Message 25] Olivia: Bye!

[Message 26] Liam: Hey Maya, you doing okay? You seemed extra shaken up.

[Message 27] Maya: Yeah, just… it's hitting me hard. I knew Casey. It feels too close to home. I was thinking of calling 911 after the accident but my phone died on me.

[Message 28] Liam: I get it. It's rough. Just remember we're all here for you.

[Message 29] Maya: Thanks, Liam. I appreciate that.

[Message 30] Chloe: Noah, you alright? You were supposed to be there...

[Message 31] Noah: Honestly, Chloe, I'm a mess. Keep thinking about what if. What if I went and could have helped?

[Message 32] Chloe: Don't beat yourself up, Noah. It's not your fault.

[Message 33] Noah: Easy for you to say. I saw David leave the building at Dusk and never return.

[Message 34] Chloe: David? What was he doing there?

[Message 35] Noah: He said he was picking up a friend, but he looked really agitated.

[Message 36] Chloe: That's weird. David's always seemed so calm.

[Message 37] Liam: David? You sure? He was with me all night working on that project.

[Message 38] Maya: Yeah, I saw you guys at the library until late.

[Message 39] Chloe: So Noah's mistaken?

[Message 40] Noah: I swear it was him. Maybe it was just someone who looked like him.

[Message 41] Olivia: This is all so confusing.

[Message 42] Liam: Let's just focus on the movie tonight, guys. We can talk about this later.

[Message 43] Maya: Agreed.

[Message 44] Chloe: Okay.

[Message 45] Noah: Fine.

[Message 46] Olivia: See you all soon.

[Message 47] Liam to Maya (Private): Hey, can you come over a little earlier? Want to talk.

[Message 48] Maya to Liam (Private): Sure, what's up?

[Message 49] Liam to Maya (Private): Just… I need to vent. This David thing has me freaked out.

[Message 50] Maya to Liam (Private): I'll be there around 6:30.

[Message 51] Chloe to Olivia (Private): Something's fishy. Noah's acting weird.

[Message 52] Olivia to Chloe (Private): Yeah, and the David thing doesn't add up.

[Message 53] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I have a bad feeling about this whole thing.

[Message 54] Olivia to Chloe (Private): Me too. Should we say something to the police?

[Message 55] Chloe to Olivia (Private): Let's wait and see what happens tonight.

[Message 56] Noah to Chloe (Private): Hey, about what I said about David… maybe I was wrong. It was dark.

[Message 57] Chloe to Noah (Private): Why are you changing your story?

[Message 58] Noah to Chloe (Private): I don't know. Just… forget I said anything.

[Message 59] Chloe to Noah (Private): Now I'm really worried.

[Message 60] Noah to Chloe (Private): Don't be. Just… drop it.

[Message 61] Liam: Pizza's ordered!

[Message 62] Maya: Great!

[Message 63] Chloe: Awesome.

[Message 64] Noah: Cool.

[Message 65] Olivia: Can't wait!

[Message 66] Liam to Maya (Private): Hey, can you bring the board games?

[Message 67] Maya to Liam (Private): Sure thing.

[Message 68] Chloe to Olivia (Private): Did you see that? Liam's being so normal.

[Message 69] Olivia to Chloe (Private): Too normal. It's creeping me out.

[Message 70] Noah to Chloe (Private): I think I should leave town.

[Message 71] Chloe to Noah (Private): What? Why?

[Message 72] Noah to Chloe (Private): I just… I don't feel safe here anymore.

[Message 73] Chloe to Noah (Private): Noah, you need to tell me what's going on.

[Message 74] Noah to Chloe (Private): I can't. Just… trust me.

[Message 75] Chloe to Noah (Private): I don't know if I can, Noah.

[Message 76] Olivia to Chloe (Private): He's definitely involved somehow.

[Message 77] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I think so too.

[Message 78] Liam: Almost there!

[Message 79] Maya: On my way!

[Message 80] Chloe: Leaving now.

[Message 81] Noah: Be there soon.

[Message 82] Olivia: Heading out!

[Message 83] Liam to Maya (Private): So glad you're coming early.

[Message 84] Maya to Liam (Private): Me too. I need to talk to someone.

[Message 85] Liam to Maya (Private): I'm here.

[Message 86] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I'm calling the police after the movie.

[Message 87] Olivia to Chloe (Private): Good. This has gone too far.

[Message 88] Noah to Chloe (Private): I knew that Casey always hated David.

[Message 89] Chloe to Noah (Private): What does David have to do with this, Noah?

[Message 90] Noah to Chloe (Private): Just...be careful, Chloe.

[Message 91] Chloe to Olivia (Private): Did Noah say something to you about David?

[Message 92] Olivia to Chloe (Private): No, why?

[Message 93] Chloe to Olivia (Private): He just texted me something really cryptic about David.

[Message 94] Olivia to Chloe (Private): This is escalating quickly.

[Message 95] Liam: Movie time!

[Message 96] Maya: Popcorn's ready!

[Message 97] Chloe: Let's get this over with.

[Message 98] Noah: Okay.

[Message 99] Olivia: Finally.

[Message 100] Liam to Maya (Private): So, what's bothering you?

[Message 101] Maya to Liam (Private): I keep thinking about what happened to Casey. Did she knew that she wanted to get rid of David?

[Message 102] Liam to Maya (Private): Who knows? People say all sorts of things.

[Message 103] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I think Noah intended to hurt someone that night.

[Message 104] Olivia to Chloe (Private): I agree. His behavior is unsettling.

[Message 105] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I feel like we're sitting on a powder keg.

[Message 106] Olivia to Chloe (Private): We need to be careful.

[Message 107] Noah to Chloe (Private): I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

[Message 108] Chloe to Noah (Private): What did you do, Noah?

[Message 109] Noah to Chloe (Private): I can't tell you. It's too dangerous.

[Message 110] Chloe to Olivia (Private): He's admitting to something!

[Message 111] Olivia to Chloe (Private): Call the police now!

[Message 112] Chloe to Olivia (Private): On it!

[Message 113] Liam: Okay, movie's done. Anyone want to play a game?

[Message 114] Maya: Sure, let's do it.

[Message 115] Noah: Maybe later. I'm not feeling so good.

[Message 116] Olivia: We should probably head out anyway.

[Message 117] Chloe: Yeah, I'm tired too.

[Message 118] Liam: Alright, suit yourselves.

[Message 119] Maya: Thanks for hosting, Liam.

[Message 120] Chloe: Thanks.

[Message 121] Olivia: Bye!

[Message 122] Noah: See ya.

[Message 123] Liam to Maya (Private): Something's definitely up with those two.

[Message 124] Maya to Liam (Private): I know, right?

[Message 125] Liam to Maya (Private): Well, thanks for coming early. I appreciate it.

[Message 126] Maya to Liam (Private): Anytime. I'm here for you too.

[Message 127] Olivia to Chloe (Private): The police are on their way.

[Message 128] Chloe to Olivia (Private): Good. I feel like a huge weight is about to be lifted.

[Message 129] Noah to Chloe (Private): I was looking up how to make Car accident (vehicular homicide) online

[Message 130] Chloe to Noah (Private): You WHAT?!?!

[Message 131] Noah to Chloe (Private): I tried to talk him out of it.

[Message 132] Chloe to Noah (Private): You need to turn yourself in, Noah.

[Message 133] Noah to Chloe (Private): I can't. They'll never believe me.

[Message 134] Chloe to Olivia (Private): He admitted to planning something!

[Message 135] Olivia to Chloe (Private): The police are almost here! Stay calm!

[Message 136] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I'm trying!

[Message 137] Liam: What was that scream?

[Message 138] Maya: Sounded like it came from outside.

[Message 139] Chloe: The police are here.

[Message 140] Olivia: Thank god.

[Message 141] Noah: I gotta go.

[Message 142] Chloe: You're not going anywhere, Noah.

[Message 143] Olivia: It's over, Noah.

[Message 144] Liam: What the hell is going on?

[Message 145] Maya: I think we're about to find out.

[Message 146] Police: Everyone stay where you are!

[Message 147] Liam: Woah, what's happening?

[Message 148] Maya: This is crazy!

[Message 149] Chloe: It's about time.

[Message 150] Olivia: Finally.

[Message 151] Police: Noah, you're under arrest.

[Message 152] Noah: I didn't do anything!

[Message 153] Chloe: Yes, you did, Noah.

[Message 154] Olivia: It's over.

[Message 155] Liam: I'm so confused.

[Message 156] Maya: Me too.

[Message 157] Police: We need everyone else to come down to the station for questioning.

[Message 158] Liam: Okay, I'll cooperate.

[Message 159] Maya: Me too.

[Message 160] Chloe: Let's get this over with.

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, crazy, right? Heard it on the news. Two people…
[Message 3] Chloe: So awful! Who were they?
[Message 4] Maya: I think one was a cop, name of Alex?
[Message 5] Liam: And the other?
[Message 6] Chloe: I heard it was someone named Jordan. So young.
[Message 7] David: Go-Kart Track? Seriously? What happened?
[Message 8] Maya: Murder, David! Apparently, they were pushed.
[Message 9] David: Pushed? From where? Sounds awful.
[Message 10] Liam: No idea, details are sketchy. Everyone's saying different things.
[Message 11] Chloe: I heard a rumor it was someone who used to work there.
[Message 12] Maya: You think it was someone with a grudge?
[Message 13] David: Maybe. People get fired all the time.
[Message 14] Liam: True, but murder? That's a big leap.
[Message 15] Chloe: Especially pushing someone! That's so… personal.
[Message 16] Maya: Yeah, you have to get right up close.
[Message 17] David: Anyone know Alex and Jordan?
[Message 18] Liam: I knew Alex a little. Seemed like a good person.
[Message 19] Chloe: Me too! Always smiling.
[Message 20] Maya: I only saw them around, never really talked.
[Message 21] David: What about Jordan?
[Message 22] Liam: Never met Jordan.
[Message 23] Chloe: Same here.
[Message 24] Maya: So messed up.
[Message 25] David: Definitely.
[Message 26] Liam: The cops will figure it out, right?
[Message 27] Chloe: Hope so.
[Message 28] Maya: They have to. For Alex and Jordan.
[Message 29] David: I heard some rumors.
[Message 30] Liam: About what?
[Message 31] David: That Alex was getting close to someone's partner.
[Message 32] Chloe: Wow, really?
[Message 33] Maya: Spicy! But still, doesn't justify this.
[Message 34] Liam: Exactly.
[Message 35] David: Just saying, could be a motive.
[Message 36] Chloe: Did anyone see anything strange that night? Early Evening?
[Message 37] Maya: I was at home, watching TV.
[Message 38] Liam: I was out of town.
[Message 39] David: I was… grabbing a late dinner.
[Message 40] Chloe: Where, David?
[Message 41] David: Just a local diner. Why?
[Message 42] Chloe: Just curious. This whole thing is making me paranoid.
[Message 43] Maya: Me too.
[Message 44] Liam: Seriously.
[Message 45] David: I get it.
[Message 46] Maya: I saw Sarah there earlier that day.
[Message 47] Liam: Sarah? Working?
[Message 48] Chloe: Sarah hasn't worked there for months.
[Message 49] Maya: I just remember seeing her around. But I could be wrong.
[Message 50] David: Maybe she was just visiting.
[Message 51] Liam: Yeah, could be.
[Message 52] Chloe: Still, weird.
[Message 53] Maya: I agree.
[Message 54] David: I'm sure it's nothing.
[Message 55] Liam: Let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 56] Chloe: True, true.
[Message 57] Maya: You guys think they'll find the person?
[Message 58] Liam: They have to.
[Message 59] David: It's Toledo, not exactly a hotbed of criminal masterminds.
[Message 60] Chloe: Rude, David!
[Message 61] Maya: Haha!
[Message 62] Liam: He's got a point though.
[Message 63] David: I'm just saying, someone is going to get a very long sentence for this.
[Message 64] Chloe: It's awful to think about.
[Message 65] Maya: Agreed.
[Message 66] Liam: This is going to haunt that place.
[Message 67] David: For sure.
[Message 68] Chloe: I feel bad for the owners.
[Message 69] Maya: Me too.
[Message 70] Liam: They must be devastated.
[Message 71] David: Anyone going to the vigil tomorrow?
[Message 72] Chloe: I am.
[Message 73] Maya: I think I will too.
[Message 74] Liam: I'm still out of town.
[Message 75] David: I'll be there.
[Message 76] Chloe: Good.
[Message 77] Maya: It's the least we can do.
[Message 78] Liam: Agreed.
[Message 79] David: We should all stick together.
[Message 80] Chloe: Definitely.
[Message 81] Maya: Yup.
[Message 82] Liam: For sure.
[Message 83] David: So, diner. Anyone want to go later?
[Message 84] Chloe: Sure, I'm in.

[Message 88] Chloe: Yeah!
[Message 89] Maya: Totally.
[Message 90] Liam: I'll be there.
[Message 91] David: So, who do we think did it? Seriously?
[Message 92] Chloe: I have no idea.
[Message 93] Maya: Me neither.
[Message 94] Liam: It could be anyone.
[Message 95] David: But someone must have intended it.
[Message 96] Chloe: I guess so.
[Message 97] Maya: A horrible thing to intend.
[Message 98] Liam: True.
[Message 99] David: Well, see you guys later.
[Message 100] Chloe: Bye!
[Message 101] Maya: Later!
[Message 102] Liam: Peace out.

[Message 103] Sarah: Hey David, it's Sarah. Need to ask you something about that night.
[Message 104] David: Hey Sarah. What's up?
[Message 105] Sarah: Someone said they saw me near the Go-Kart Track. Did you see me?
[Message 106] David: I didn't see you, no. I was at the diner, remember?
[Message 107] Sarah: Right, the diner. Okay, good. Just checking.
[Message 108] David: Why are you worried? You didn't do anything, did you?
[Message 109] Sarah: Of course not! Just...paranoid.
[Message 110] David: Relax. I'll back you up if anyone asks.
[Message 111] Sarah: Thanks, David. I owe you one.
[Message 112] David: No problem.

[Message 113] Chloe: Maya, quick question.
[Message 114] Maya: Yeah?
[Message 115] Chloe: When you saw Sarah, what time was it roughly?
[Message 116] Maya: Hmmm, maybe late afternoon? Around 5 maybe?
[Message 117] Chloe: Okay, thanks. Just trying to piece things together.
[Message 118] Maya: Sure. Why?
[Message 119] Chloe: No reason.

[Message 120] David: (To Liam) Don't mention Sarah to anyone. Got it?
[Message 121] Liam: What? Why not?
[Message 122] David: Just trust me on this.
[Message 123] Liam: Okay… weird.

[Message 124] Sarah: (To David) did they find out who killed Alex and Jordan yet?
[Message 125] David: No, not yet.
[Message 126] Sarah: Good. I mean… I hope they do soon.
[Message 127] David: Me too.

[Message 128] Chloe: (To Maya) I think David knows more than he's letting on.
[Message 129] Maya: Really? Why do you say that?
[Message 130] Chloe: Just a feeling. Something about how defensive he gets.
[Message 131] Maya: Hmmm. I see what you mean.
[Message 132] Chloe: I’m just wondering if her shouting probably provoked him that evening.
[Message 133] Maya: True.

[Message 134] Liam: (To David) You seem stressed. Everything okay?
[Message 135] David: Yeah, fine. Just tired of hearing about this whole thing.
[Message 136] Liam: I get it.
[Message 137] David: It's just… if he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened!
[Message 138] Liam: Whoa, David. Easy there. Fired who?
[Message 139] David: Never mind. Just talking.

[Message 140] Sarah: (To David) I saw you leave the building at Early Evening that night.
[Message 141] David: What? No, you didn't.
[Message 142] Sarah: I did, David. Don't lie to me.

[Message 143] David: (To Sarah) Listen, you need to keep your mouth shut.
[Message 144] Sarah: Or what, David? What are you going to do?
[Message 145] David: I'm just saying, the less you know, the better.
[Message 146] Sarah: I know enough to know you're involved.
[Message 147] David: I didn't purposefully do anything.
[Message 148] Sarah: The CCTV Footage is out, David.

[Message 149] David: (To Liam) They're going away for a long time for this. I can tell you.
[Message 150] Liam: Dude, what are you talking about?
[Message 151] David: Nothing. Never mind.

[Message 152] Chloe: (To Maya) Any news?
[Message 153] Maya: Not really. Still investigating.
[Message 154] Chloe: I just hope they get the right person.

[Message 155] Liam: (To David) I'm really worried about you.
[Message 156] David: I'm fine, Liam. Just leave it.
[Message 157] Liam: Okay.

[Message 158] Sarah: (To David) I'm going to the police.
[Message 159] David: No, please don't.
[Message 160] Sarah: You knew he always hated 1.  Law Enforcement Officer.
[Message 161] David: It was an accident!

[Message 162] Chloe: (To Maya) I bet he's looking up how to make Pushing from a height online.
[Message 163] Maya: That's a pretty big accusation.
[Message 164] Chloe: True.

[Message 165] Liam: (To David) Dude you didn't call 911?

[Message 5] Sarah: ""Small world, I guess. What's up with you? You sound weird.""
[Message 6] Ben: ""Just stressed. Work stuff. Trying to get this project done. Did you see Daniel yesterday? He mentioned that he went to the synagogue before to help set up for an event.""
[Message 7] Sarah: ""Daniel? No, haven't seen him in ages. Why?""
[Message 8] Ben: ""No reason. Just making conversation. They're going away for a long time for this, I just know it.""
[Message 9] Sarah: ""Well, whoever did it, I hope they catch them. You going to the game tonight?""
[Message 10] Ben: ""Nah, too much going on. You?""
[Message 11] Sarah: ""Maybe. Depends. Anya told me she was buying a weird knife set at the store. Said it was for a cooking class, but seems strange, right?""
[Message 12] Ben: ""Could be anything. Don't jump to conclusions. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 13] Sarah: ""True. Anyway, I gotta run. Talk later.""
[Message 14] Ben: ""Later. Oh, and Sarah, if Daniel calls, tell him I'm not interested in whatever he's selling.""
[Message 15] Sarah: ""Will do. He's always trying to sell something. Hey, someone told me that Anya was shouting at Officer Miller right before he went over there.""
[Message 16] Ben: ""Wow, things are really heating up for Anya.""
[Message 17] Sarah: ""Heard some dude with a stutter saw her leave at Late Afternoon.""
[Message 18] Ben: ""Whoa. Maybe she shouldn't have fired Anya.""
[Message 19] Sarah: ""She knew he was going to find out anyway.""
[Message 20] Sarah: ""Maybe that's just a rumor. People talk.""
[Message 21] Ben: ""People do talk. I thought I saw Daniel looking up how to make Impalement with a sharp object online. But I wasn't sure.""
[Message 22] Sarah: ""Okay, that's... worrying. Maybe you should tell the police about Daniel. What if he was trying to get rid of him?""
[Message 23] Ben: ""I don't know... I don't want to get involved. He always hated Officer Miller.""
[Message 24] Sarah: ""I get it, but it's serious. This could all be avoided if someone called 911 right away.""
[Message 25] Ben: ""Alright, alright. I'll think about it. You're right, this is messing with my head.""

[Message 124] Liam: ""Not that I know of. She was pretty well-liked.""
[Message 125] Maria: ""Yeah, she was always nice to everyone.""
[Message 126] Ben: ""Unless...""
[Message 127] Liam: ""Unless what, Ben?""
[Message 128] Ben: ""Unless it was a robbery gone wrong? Maybe she surprised someone?""
[Message 129] Chloe: ""That's a possibility. A sad one, but possible.""
[Message 130] Maria: ""Yeah, that makes sense. This city is getting dangerous.""
[Message 131] David: ""Exactly. Could happen to anyone.""
[Message 132] Liam: ""Let's not speculate. The police will figure it out.""
[Message 133] Chloe: ""I hope so. For Sarah's sake.""
[Message 134] Maria: ""Me too.""
[Message 135] Ben: ""Yeah, definitely.""
[Message 136] David: ""Of course. Justice will be served.""

[Message 142] Chloe: ""I’m so worried. How did she even die? And was there anything she tried to say that she couldn’t?""
[Message 143] Maria: ""I heard someone say they think it was poisoning via inhalation and the police are reviewing the security tapes now.""
[Message 144] Ben: ""Wow, poisoning via inhalation. That’s dark. Hope they find out who did it and that they don’t get the death penalty.""
[Message 145] David: ""Hope they find them too. I'm sure they are looking into it.""
[Message 146] Chloe: ""David, do you think it’s possible the death was accidental? During a robbery maybe?""
[Message 147] David: ""Could be, but it sounds pretty intentional.""
[Message 148] Ben: ""We should go to the vigil tonight.""
[Message 149] Maria: ""I’ll be there for sure.""
[Message 150] Chloe: ""Me too. It’s the least we can do for Sarah.""

[Message 2] Casey: Yeah, crazy! Two people dead. What a tragedy.
[Message 3] Ashley: I know, right? Did you know either of them?
[Message 4] Casey: Nah, not really. I saw Maria (Victim 2) around sometimes. She kept to herself. The Corrections Officer (Victim 1), I didn't know him at all.
[Message 5] Ashley: Me neither. Such a weird thing to happen here.
[Message 6] Casey: You think they'll find out who did it?
[Message 7] Ashley: Eventually, I guess. Mobile PD isn't exactly known for their speed.
[Message 8] Casey: True. Hey, you going to that new bar tonight?
[Message 9] Ashley: Maybe. Depends. Who's going?
[Message 10] Casey: Just the usual crew. Sarah, maybe Denise, I think.
[Message 11] Ashley: Denise? I thought she was out of town.
[Message 12] Casey: Oh, maybe I'm wrong. It was someone.
[Message 13] Ashley: Well, let me know for sure. I might pop in.
[Message 14] Casey: Will do. Later!
[Message 15] Ashley: Later.
[Message 16] Sarah: Did you see the news? About the Taxi Stand?
[Message 17] Denise: Yeah, it's all over Facebook. Scary stuff.
[Message 18] Sarah: I know! I was just there yesterday morning...
[Message 19] Denise: Seriously? Around what time?
[Message 20] Sarah: Like, Late Morning, maybe? Getting a ride to work.
[Message 21] Denise: Wow. That's… close.
[Message 22] Sarah: I know, right? Makes you think.
[Message 23] Denise: Tell me about it. You hear any rumors about who did it?
[Message 24] Sarah: Just that it was some kind of… argument gone wrong?
[Message 25] Denise: That's what I heard too. You think they'll catch them?
[Message 26] Sarah: Hope so. For everyone's sake.
[Message 27] Denise: Amen to that. Hey, you still on for dinner Friday?
[Message 28] Sarah: Yep! I'm craving that new Italian place.
[Message 29] Denise: Perfect. I'll make a reservation.
[Message 30] Sarah: Great! Talk to you later.
[Message 31] Denise: Later.
[Message 32] Alex: Hey, heard about the Taxi Stand?
[Message 33] Blake: Yeah, terrible.
[Message 34] Alex: You know anyone involved?
[Message 35] Blake: Not really. I think I saw Maria (Victim 2) at the library once. She was always reading.
[Message 36] Alex: Right. Weird. So, you still doing that thing for me next week?
[Message 37] Blake: Yeah, still on. Just need to confirm the details.
[Message 38] Alex: Cool. Important that it goes smoothly this time.
[Message 39] Blake: Don't worry. I've got it covered.
[Message 40] Alex: Good. I'm counting on you.
[Message 41] Blake: You can.
[Message 42] Alex: Later.
[Message 43] Blake: Later.
[Message 44] Taylor: Hey, you see the news?
[Message 45] Jordan: Yeah, awful. What happened?
[Message 46] Taylor: Two people dead at the Taxi Stand.
[Message 47] Jordan: No way! I was just there yesterday.
[Message 48] Taylor: Really? Doing what?
[Message 49] Jordan: Just grabbing a cab. Going to see my mom.
[Message 50] Taylor: Oh, okay. Just curious.
[Message 51] Jordan: Why? You think I did something?
[Message 52] Taylor: No, no! Just… it's so close to home, you know?
[Message 53] Jordan: Yeah, I guess. Makes you think.
[Message 54] Taylor: So, you see anything weird?
[Message 55] Jordan: Nah, nothing really. Just the usual.
[Message 56] Taylor: Okay. Well, stay safe.
[Message 57] Jordan: You too.
[Message 58] Ashley: So, I saw Denise at the coffee shop today.
[Message 59] Casey: Oh yeah? How's she doing?
[Message 60] Ashley: Seemed a little… on edge, maybe?
[Message 61] Casey: On edge? About what?
[Message 62] Ashley: I don't know. Just seemed like something was bothering her.
[Message 63] Casey: Maybe she knows something about what happened at the Taxi Stand.
[Message 64] Ashley: Maybe. Or maybe she's just stressed about work.
[Message 65] Casey: Could be.
[Message 66] Sarah: Hey Denise, quick question... you wouldn't happen to know anything about the Taxi Stand thing, would you?
[Message 67] Denise: What?! Why would you even ask me that?!
[Message 68] Sarah: Just thought I'd check. No reason to get defensive.
[Message 69] Denise: I'm not defensive! I just don't appreciate the accusation.
[Message 70] Sarah: Okay, okay. Calm down. Just forget I asked.
[Message 71] Blake: Everything still good for next week?
[Message 72] Alex: Yeah, but I need you to be extra careful.
[Message 73] Blake: Always am. What's changed?
[Message 74] Alex: Just… the Taxi Stand thing has everyone on edge. Cops are everywhere.
[Message 75] Blake: Got it. I'll be discreet.
[Message 76] Taylor: You think the cops will actually solve this?
[Message 77] Jordan: I doubt it. Unless someone talks.
[Message 78] Taylor: You think someone will?
[Message 79] Jordan: Maybe. Depends on who's involved.
[Message 80] Taylor: True. Hey, you still have that thing I lent you?
[Message 81] Jordan: Yeah, it's here. Why?
[Message 82] Taylor: Just wondering. I might need it back soon.
[Message 83] Jordan: Okay, no problem. Let me know when.
[Message 84] Casey: Ashley, you won't believe what I just heard.
[Message 85] Ashley: What? Spill the tea.
[Message 86] Casey: Apparently, someone saw Alex arguing with the Corrections Officer (Victim 1) just a few days ago.
[Message 87] Ashley: No way! About what?
[Message 88] Casey: I don't know. Something about money, maybe?
[Message 89] Ashley: Hmm. Interesting.
[Message 90] Casey: Right? Makes you wonder.
[Message 91] Ashley: Definitely.
[Message 92] Denise: Sarah, I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.
[Message 93] Sarah: It's okay. I get it. Stressful times.
[Message 94] Denise: Yeah. It's just… I knew Maria (Victim 2). Not well, but we talked sometimes.
[Message 95] Sarah: Oh, wow. That must be tough.
[Message 96] Denise: It is. I just… I hope they find who did this.
[Message 97] Sarah: Me too.
[Message 98] Alex: Blake, I need you to find out who's been talking to the cops.
[Message 99] Blake: That's not part of the deal.
[Message 100] Alex: It is now. This is getting too hot.
[Message 101] Blake: Fine. But it'll cost you extra.
[Message 102] Alex: Whatever. Just get it done. I need to know who's running their mouth.
[Message 103] Taylor: Jordan, you still awake?
[Message 104] Jordan: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 105] Taylor: I'm just… scared.
[Message 106] Jordan: About what? The Taxi Stand thing?
[Message 107] Taylor: Yeah. And… other things.
[Message 108] Jordan: What other things?
[Message 109] Taylor: Never mind. Just… forget I said anything.
[Message 110] Jordan: No, tell me. What's wrong?
[Message 111] Ashley: Casey, I just remembered something. I saw Jordan near the Taxi Stand at Late Morning.
[Message 112] Casey: Really? What was she doing?
[Message 113] Ashley: Just standing there. Seemed like she was waiting for someone.
[Message 114] Casey: Interesting. She didn't mention that to Taylor, did she?
[Message 115] Ashley: I don't think so.
[Message 116] Casey: Maybe she's involved somehow.
[Message 117] Ashley: Maybe. Or maybe it's just a coincidence.
[Message 118] Denise: Sarah, I keep thinking about Maria (Victim 2). She was always so quiet. I remember her saying she was worried about someone exposing a secret of hers.
[Message 119] Sarah: Oh, really? What kind of secret?
[Message 120] Denise: I don't know. She never said. But she seemed really scared.
[Message 121] Sarah: Wow. Maybe that's why she was killed.
[Message 122] Denise: Maybe. It's awful to think about.
[Message 123] Alex: Blake, any news?
[Message 124] Blake: Yeah. I found out who's been talking.
[Message 125] Alex: Who?
[Message 126] Blake: It was the Corrections Officer. (Victim 1). He was going to the cops about your… activities.
[Message 127] Alex: (Victim 1) was? Damn it.
[Message 128] Blake: Yeah. He knew too much.
[Message 129] Alex: Well, that explains a lot.
[Message 130] Taylor: Jordan, please tell me what's going on. You're scaring me.
[Message 131] Jordan: It's nothing, Taylor. Just… personal stuff.
[Message 132] Taylor: Is it about the Taxi Stand?
[Message 133] Jordan: No! Okay? Just drop it.
[Message 134] Taylor: But…
[Message 135] Jordan: Please, Taylor. I can't talk about it.
[Message 136] Ashley: Casey, I think we should tell the cops what we know.
[Message 137] Casey: Are you crazy? No way!
[Message 138] Ashley: But what if we can help them catch the killer?
[Message 139] Casey: We don't know anything for sure! And we don't want to get involved.
[Message 140] Ashley: But…
[Message 141] Casey: No buts! We stay out of it. Understand? I don’t want them to come looking for us.
[Message 142] Denise: Sarah, I keep having this feeling that something isn't right.
[Message 143] Sarah: What do you mean?
[Message 144] Denise: I don't know. Just… something about the whole situation.
[Message 145] Sarah: Maybe you're just being paranoid.
[Message 146] Denise: Maybe. But I can't shake this feeling that there's more to it than we know. I always thought Maria was aware someone wanted to get rid of her.
[Message 147] Sarah: Like what?
[Message 148] Denise: I don't know! That's the problem!
[Message 149] Alex: Blake, make sure this never happens again.
[Message 150] Blake: What do you mean?
[Message 151] Alex: You know what I mean. No more loose ends.
[Message 152] Blake: Got it.
[Message 153] Taylor: Jordan, I saw you with Alex the other day.
[Message 154] Jordan: What? No, you didn't.
[Message 155] Taylor: Yes, I did. You were talking near the Taxi Stand.
[Message 156] Jordan: It wasn't me. You're mistaken.
[Message 157] Taylor: I know it was you, Jordan. What's going on?
[Message 158] Ashley: Casey, I can't sleep. I keep thinking about those people.
[Message 159] Casey: Try to relax. It's over.
[Message 160] Ashley: But what if it's not? What if the killer strikes again?
[Message 161] Casey: They won't. The cops will catch them.
[Message 162] Ashley: But what if they don't?
[Message 163] Casey: Just try to get some sleep. We'll talk about it in the morning.
[Message 164] Denise: Sarah, I think I know who might have been involved.
[Message 165] Sarah: Who?
[Message 166] Denise: I don't want to say it over text. Can we talk in person?
[Message 167] Sarah: Sure. When?
[Message 168] Denise: How about tomorrow? At the coffee shop?
[Message 169] Sarah: Okay. See you then.
[Message 170] Alex: Blake, I need you to disappear for a while.
[Message 171] Blake: What? Why?
[Message 172] Alex: Just trust me. It's for your own good.
[Message 173] Blake: Where am I supposed to go?
[Message 174] Alex: I'll tell you later. Just be ready to leave at a moment's notice.
[Message 175] Taylor: Jordan, I'm going to the police.
[Message 176] Jordan: No, Taylor, please don't!
[Message 177] Taylor: I have to. I can't live with this anymore.
[Message 178] Jordan: They're going away for a long time for this. Please! Don't do this to me.
[Message 179] Taylor: I'm sorry, Jordan. I have to do what's right.
[Message 180] Casey: Ashley, you need to calm down. You're overreacting.
[Message 181] Ashley: No, I'm not! I'm scared, Casey!
[Message 182] Casey: There's nothing to be scared of. We're safe.
[Message 183] Ashley: Are we? Are you sure?
[Message 184] Casey: Yes! Now please, just try to relax.
[Message 185] Denise: Sarah, I saw Blake buying Asphyxiation by strangulation rope at the store yesterday morning.
[Message 186] Sarah: What?! Are you serious?
[Message 187] Denise: Yes! I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now…
[Message 188] Sarah: That's insane. We need to tell the cops.
[Message 189] Denise: I know. I'm just… scared.
[Message 190] Alex: Blake, why did Denise see you buying that rope? You were supposed to be careful!
[Message 191] Blake: I didn't know she was there! It's just for… a project.
[Message 192] Alex: What kind of project needs rope?
[Message 193] Blake: A… art project!
[Message 194] Alex: You better hope the cops believe that.
[Message 195] Taylor: I just gave my statement to the police. I hope I did the right thing.

[Message 7] Ben: ""I saw him Late Morning! He was arguing with someone near the stairs.""
[Message 8] Carter: ""Who was he arguing with, Ben?""
[Message 9] Ben: ""I couldn't tell. Just saw their back.""
[Message 10] Dana: ""This is awful. He seemed alright the other day, a bit cynical, but alright.""
[Message 11] Anya: ""Cynical is an understatement. Remember how he fired Sarah for being late all the time?""
[Message 12] Carter: ""Sarah? She needed to get her act together. Being late all the time isn't cool. Does anyone know what the police said?""
[Message 13] Ben: ""Rumor is, they are treating it as a homicide.""
[Message 14] Dana: ""Homicide?! Oh god. Someone purposefully did this?""
[Message 15] Anya: ""Wouldn't be surprised. David stepped on a lot of toes. He was always aware of his power.""
[Message 16] Carter: ""Okay, let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe it was an accident.""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Accident from a height? Unlikely.""
[Message 18] Dana: ""True. Still, we shouldn’t spread rumors. Let's wait for the police report.""
[Message 19] Anya: ""Fine, Miss Prudence. I'm just saying, karma is a b****.""
[Message 20] Carter: ""Anya! That's a horrible thing to say. Someone died.""
[Message 21] Dana: ""He didn't deserve this. Remember his anniversary, right?""
[Message 22] Anya: ""I just meant he wasn't a saint. I didn't intend for him to die. I just wanted him to suffer a bit.""
[Message 23] Ben: ""Whoa, Anya. That's… intense. You went there often, didn't you?""
[Message 24] Anya: ""I needed my latte! What's that got to do with anything?""
[Message 25] Carter: ""He wasn't really the worst boss. I feel bad for his family.""
[Message 26] Dana: ""Me too. Poor Maria.""
[Message 27] Ben: ""Maria must be devastated.""
[Message 28] Anya: ""Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm just… upset. This whole thing is unsettling.""
[Message 29] Carter: ""We all are. Did any of you guys see anything unusual lately? At the Coffee Shop?""
[Message 30] Ben: ""Now that you mention it, I saw Felix lurking around there last week. Looked like he was waiting for someone. With those age spots on his hands.""
[Message 31] Dana: ""Felix? What would he be doing there? He usually sticks to the hardware store.""
[Message 32] Anya: ""Felix does own half the hardware store. David was thinking of buying him out.""
[Message 33] Carter: ""Well, that would give him a motive. Disagreement over business matters.""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Maybe. But Felix seemed pretty chill when I talked to him last month.""
[Message 35] Dana: ""Right, everyone take it easy. It's very easy to accuse.""
[Message 36] Anya: ""Easy for you to say. You're always so calm, Dana.""
[Message 37] Ben: ""Speaking of which, Dana, did you ever figure out that political assassination for your play?""
[Message 38] Dana: ""It's just research, Ben! It's not like I know how to Pushing from a height anyone!""
[Message 39] Carter: ""Guys, stop! You're making this worse.""
[Message 40] Anya: ""Relax, Carter. We're just talking.""
[Message 41] Ben: ""Heard the cops took Sarah for questioning.""
[Message 42] Dana: ""Really? Because she got fired?""
[Message 43] Anya: ""Well, that's not a good sign for her. Jealousy and envy are strong motives.""
[Message 44] Carter: ""They're just doing their job. It doesn't mean she's guilty.""
[Message 45] Ben: ""True, but she definitely hated David. She said she wanted to get rid of him.""
[Message 46] Dana: ""Whoa! That's… not good.""
[Message 47] Anya: ""See? I told you he made enemies.""
[Message 48] Carter: ""Okay, let’s just all cooperate with the police. That's the best thing we can do.""
[Message 49] Ben: ""Agreed. I'm telling them about seeing Felix last week.""
[Message 50] Dana: ""I'll mention what Sarah said. Even though it's just hearsay.""
[Message 51] Anya: ""I'll tell them about the weather. And that David was cynical.""
[Message 52] Carter: ""Anya! Seriously?""
[Message 53] Ben: ""I wonder what kind of punishment they're looking at for this.""
[Message 54] Dana: ""It depends on whether it was planned or not, right? Probably going away for a long time.""
[Message 55] Anya: ""Guys, I need to go. Grocery shopping.""
[Message 56] Carter: ""Okay, be safe.""
[Message 57] Ben: ""See ya.""
[Message 58] Dana: ""Later.""
[Message 59] Anya: ""Hey Ben, you still have that ladder I lent you last month?""
[Message 60] Ben: ""Yeah, in the shed. Why?""
[Message 61] Anya: ""Just curious. I need one soon. For some, uh, repairs.""
[Message 62] Ben: ""Okay. Just let me know when. Also, did you happen to see anyone else around Coffee Shop lately, Anya? You live nearby.""
[Message 63] Anya: ""Nope. Just David, going to work, looking stressed. Why?""
[Message 64] Ben: ""No reason. Just trying to remember everything.""
[Message 65] Dana: ""Okay, I'm signing off for a bit. Need to focus on this play.""
[Message 66] Carter: ""Good luck with it.""
[Message 67] Anya: ""Yeah, break a leg! (Not literally, haha).""
[Message 68] Ben: ""Dana, did you know David was pushing for you to be the new head of drama club?""
[Message 69] Dana: ""What? No, I had no idea! Why would he do that?""
[Message 70] Ben: ""He thought you had potential. He always hated 10. Social Worker. He said you understood tragedy.""
[Message 71] Dana: ""Wow. I... I don't know what to say.""
[Message 72] Carter: ""It's okay, Dana. Don't let it get to you.""
[Message 73] Anya: ""See? He wasn't all bad. Just misunderstood.""
[Message 74] Ben: ""Still think Felix and Sarah are more likely suspects. But hey, you never know.""
[Message 75] Dana: ""I'm still going to tell the police what Sarah said. It's important.""
[Message 76] Carter: ""Good. We all need to do our part.""
[Message 77] Anya: ""I'm baking cookies. Anyone want some?""
[Message 78] Ben: ""Sure. Chocolate chip?""
[Message 79] Dana: ""Maybe later. Still processing everything.""
[Message 80] Carter: ""Yeah, me too. This is all so messed up.""

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, Chloe. Shaken up. Crazy. Knew the guy, Ash, the corrections officer. Stubborn as a mule.

[Message 3] CHLOE: Ash? Wow. I didn't. Just saw it on the news. Tragic. You were there last night, right?

[Message 4] LIAM: Briefly. Left around 8 pm. Meeting with Ben about that landscaping job.

[Message 5] BEN: Hey Liam, just confirming you're still free tomorrow to discuss the new plants?

[Message 6] LIAM: Yep, Ben. See you then. Chloe was just asking about last night.

[Message 7] CHLOE: Sorry to pry. Just everyone’s on edge. It's just scary. I saw Dana buying some weird electrical stuff at the store yesterday afternoon.

[Message 8] LIAM: Electrical stuff? Dana? What for? She works at the library.

[Message 9] CHLOE: No idea. Said something about a ""project."" Kinda weirded me out, especially now.

[Message 10] DANA: Ugh, guys, stop texting me. I’m trying to work. And Liam, I saw you walking with a limp for a few days this week, what happened?

[Message 11] LIAM: Twisted my ankle hiking. Nothing major.

[Message 12] CHLOE: Maybe you should get that checked out Liam? Anyway Dana, what kinda project needs so much voltage?

[Message 13] DANA: It’s a sculpture, Chloe! A kinetic sculpture. Relax. The news is making everyone paranoid.

[Message 14] LIAM: Chloe, seriously, laying that on Dana seems a bit much.

[Message 15] CHLOE: I'm just saying, timing is sus, you know? And Dana always hated Ash; she got into it with him at the grocery store last week.

[Message 16] DANA: That's a lie! I didn't ""hate"" him. We disagreed about a parking space. Big deal.

[Message 17] BEN: Guys, can we keep this off the group chat? Really insensitive right now.

[Message 18] LIAM: Agreed, Ben. Chloe, maybe take a breath?

[Message 19] CHLOE: Fine, fine. I'm just freaked out. Hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 20] DANA: Me too. This whole thing is awful.

[Message 21] LIAM: The cops were asking about everyone who was at Campground that night. Did they talk to you, Dana?

[Message 22] DANA: Yeah, they asked a few questions. Standard procedure, I guess. I told them I was home all evening working on my sculpture.

[Message 23] CHLOE: Liam, did you mention seeing Ben around 8pm when you left Campground? It may help with the investigation.

[Message 24] LIAM: Yeah, I did. Look, I need to go. This is making me sick to my stomach.

[Message 25] BEN: Chloe, why you being so nosey? Just let the police do their job.

[Message 26] CHLOE: Nosey? Someone died, Ben! And someone needs to pay for that

[Message 27] DANA: Stop, Chloe. I can't imagine if that sculpture short-circuits and someone gets hurt. I'd never forgive myself!

[Message 28] BEN: Guys, let's just all try to be supportive of each other. This is a difficult time for everyone.

[Message 29] CHLOE: Supportive? Ash is dead, Ben. How supportive can we be?

[Message 30] LIAM: Just... please. No more texts about this tonight.

   • Defensiveness
   • Cooperation with others
   • Knowledge of crime details

5. Include subtle clues in 6 messages
6. Ensure all victims are mentioned by name or role (e.g., ""the manager"") at least once in the conversation.
7. **Incorporate at least 5 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Midnight"", ""She was buying Electrocution at the store"").
        *   **Mens Rea:** Hints at the suspects' state of mind, intent, or knowledge (e.g., ""He always hated 7.  Activist"", ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""). Use words like ""intended,"" ""knew,"" ""aware,"" ""purposefully"".

        *   **Causation:** Statements that link a suspect's actions to the victim's harm (e.g., ""If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened"", ""Her shouting probably provoked him"").

        *   **Attempt:** Allusions to preparatory acts or failed attempts (e.g., ""He was looking up how to make Electrocution online"", ""She tried to talk him out of it"").
        *   **Attendant/Extenuating Circumstances:** References to factors that could influence culpability (e.g., victim's age in a statutory rape hypothetical, potential self-defense claims, evidence of duress, victim's own aggression leading to the crime.)
8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

...","Here's the 85-message conversation:

[Message 1] Liam: ""Anyone else catch the news about what happened at the Botanical Garden?""
[Message 2] Kai: ""Yeah, crazy stuff. Another death at the hand of Electrocution. Poor guy, I heard it was Caleb.""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Caleb? No way! I knew him. He was always so kind.""
[Message 4] Liam: ""I know, right? Makes you wonder who'd do something like that.""
[Message 5] Kai: ""Seriously. I was there earlier that day, taking photos. Makes you think.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Photos? You like photography?""
[Message 7] Kai: ""Sometimes. Mostly landscapes. Needed a new profile picture for my app. The Botanical Garden looked so pretty, but I'm not sure the cops believe it's for profile picture.""
[Message 8] Liam: ""You talked to the cops?""
[Message 9] Kai: ""Yeah, standard procedure, I guess. Being nearby and all.""
[Message 10] Alex: ""Right. Did they ask about anyone specific?""
[Message 11] Kai: ""Nah, just general questions about who I saw, if anything seemed off. I mentioned seeing someone arguing near the rose garden, but didn't recognize them.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Rose garden, huh? Interesting.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Okay, this is getting weird. I’m going to make myself a coffee.""
[Message 14] Kai: ""Agreed. Need caffeine. This whole thing is unsettling.""
[Message 15] Liam: ""Okay, but back to the argument. Did it sound heated?""
[Message 16] Kai: ""Now that I think about it, yes, heated enough that I purposefully walked away. The guy's voice was familiar, but I can’t place it. It reminded me of Terry.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Terry? What's Terry got to do with this?""
[Message 18] Liam: ""Yeah, Alex is right. Terry barely knew Caleb.""
[Message 19] Kai: ""Maybe. Terry wasn’t a fan of Caleb's activist work. You know, all that protesting downtown. Called it a nuisance.""
[Message 20] Alex: ""Okay, that doesn't mean anything. Lots of people found the protests annoying.""
[Message 21] Liam: ""True. I mean, I secretly thought they blocked the traffic for way too long.""
[Message 22] Kai: ""The real problem is the death penalty. Do you think they'll push for it?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Hope not, but you never know with cases like this.""
[Message 24] Liam: ""Hey, anyone want to grab a pizza tonight? Need to get my mind off this.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""Pizza sounds good. I'm in. But I can only stay until 8:30. Got a thing.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""Count me out. Need to, um, catch up on some sleep.""
[Message 27] Liam: ""Alright, Alex. More for us, then! What time Kai?""
[Message 28] Kai: ""How about 7?""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Perfect. See you then. Alex, feel better!""
[Message 30] Alex: ""Thanks, Liam. You guys have fun.""
[Message 31] Liam: ""So, Kai, back to the Botanical Garden, did you see anyone else suspicious?""
[Message 32] Kai: ""Just an older lady feeding the birds. She looked harmless. But she mentioned needing Electrocution to deal with the rats in her garden.""
[Message 33] Liam: ""Hmm, odd coincidence. Electrocution again...""
[Message 34] Kai: ""Yeah, tell me about it. I even saw her looking at the manager earlier that day, like she wanted to say something.""
[Message 35] Liam: ""The manager? You think she did it? Maybe she purposefully didn't do anything when she found him?""
[Message 36] Kai: ""I'm not saying she did it, but it was definitely a weird vibe. And people say she hated him because he kept firing her relatives.""
[Message 37] Liam: ""Okay, that's a motive.""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Hey guys, sorry to interrupt. Just saw something online about the case. Apparently, the victim had a huge argument with someone named River the day before.""
[Message 39] Kai: ""River? I don't think I know River. Maybe River intended to hurt Caleb.""
[Message 40] Liam: ""River! River is obsessed with Kai. Maybe jealous of his photography. It can't be, right?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Obsessed? That's creepy. What's River like?""
[Message 42] Liam: ""Kind of intense. Always showing up where Kai is. Always staring. It's weird.""
[Message 43] Kai: ""It's true, she is a little intense. I try to avoid her. It's hard to get rid of her.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Maybe River did it out of jealousy, hoping to impress Kai? River always hated activist, if I recall.""
[Message 45] Liam: ""That would be messed up. Hope they find out the truth soon.""
[Message 46] Kai: ""Me too. I saw Terry leaving near the botanical garden at midnight. That's kind of weird too, right? Terry always knew I was there, at the Botanical Garden.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Midnight? What was Terry doing there at midnight? Did he always hate Caleb?""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Maybe he was looking for something? Seems sus.""
[Message 49] Kai: ""Yeah, seems suspicious. I should have called the cops.""
[Message 50] Alex: ""Did you see Terry near Caleb?""
[Message 51] Kai: ""Nah, just Terry by the entrance. I assumed Terry was leaving, like me. He always hated activist.""
[Message 52] Liam: ""Maybe Terry came back later?""
[Message 53] Alex: ""I need some fresh air. Going for a walk.""
[Message 54] Kai: ""Okay, Alex. Stay safe.""
[Message 55] Liam: ""Yeah, call if you need anything.""
[Message 56] Liam: ""Hey Kai, you still coming for pizza? Just confirming.""
[Message 57] Kai: ""Yep, see you soon.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Cool. So, River… You think she’s capable of something like this? Maybe her shouting provoked Terry. ""
[Message 59] Kai: ""I don't know, Liam. People are capable of anything. But Terry was talking about hurting Caleb right before he went over there.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Whoa, seriously? You heard him say that?""
[Message 61] Kai: ""Yeah, kind of brushed it off as just angry venting. Now I feel terrible.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""I think you should tell the police that. It could be important. They’re going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 63] Kai: ""I will. After pizza. I'm hungry and nervous.""
[Message 64] Alex: ""Guys, I'm back. And I just remembered something. A couple weeks ago, I overheard Terry on the phone, talking about “getting rid of” someone. I thought he was talking about his landlord.""
[Message 65] Liam: ""Whoa, Alex! That's huge! Getting rid of someone... that sounds intentional.""
[Message 66] Kai: ""He was looking up how to make Electrocution online, I'm pretty sure. Maybe that's the someone he was talking about.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""Seriously? Getting rid of the activists. Guys, this is too much.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""Yeah, this is getting really intense. I'm starting to feel uneasy.""
[Message 69] Kai: ""Me too. I need to think about this. I'm not sure I can do pizza anymore.""
[Message 70] Liam: ""What? You're backing out now? I made reservations.""
[Message 71] Kai: ""Sorry, Liam. I just need some space. I think I was aware of what was going on, but just didn't want to admit it.""
[Message 72] Alex: ""Maybe Terry's motivations aren't so obvious. Maybe it wasn't about the activism.""
[Message 73] Liam: ""What do you mean, Alex? You think it was personal?""
[Message 74] Alex: ""I don't know. Just a feeling. Something's not adding up.""
[Message 75] Kai: ""I'm going to call the police.""
[Message 76] Liam: ""Good. Do it. I'll go with you.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Wait, guys. I need to tell you something. Something I haven't mentioned before.""
[Message 78] Kai: ""What is it, Alex?""
[Message 79] Alex: ""That night, I saw someone leave the botanical garden at midnight, they intended to kill Caleb. But I was too scared to say anything.""
[Message 80] Liam: ""Who, Alex? Who did you see?""
[Message 81] Alex: ""It was River. River was buying Electrocution at the store earlier that day.""
[Message 82] Kai: ""I knew it! River is crazy.""
[Message 83] Liam: ""We need to tell the police everything. All of it.""
[Message 84] Alex: ""Agreed. This needs to end. I tried to talk him out of it.""
[Message 85] Kai: ""Let's go together. Right now.""

[Message 49] Anya: I know. But he's always been a little…intense.
[Message 50] Chloe: True, but this is different. He intended to meet Samira regularly.
[Message 51] Anya: Maybe he just liked the bar?
[Message 52] Chloe: I don’t know Anya. I overheard Liam saying he wanted to get rid of her.
[Message 53] Anya: What?! When?
[Message 54] Chloe: A few weeks ago. Before he fired her.
[Message 55] Anya: Before HE fired her? Samira?
[Message 56] Chloe: Yeah, didn't you know? He was her manager.
[Message 57] Anya: No! He never mentioned that!
[Message 58] Chloe: Exactly. Red flag, much?
[Message 59] Anya: HUGE. Okay, so what do we do?
[Message 60] Chloe: We watch him. And we tell the cops everything.
[Message 61] Anya: Agreed. This is beyond unsettling.
[Message 62] Chloe: He’s going away for a long time for this.
[Message 63] Anya: Hopefully. Poor Omar and Samira.
[Message 64] Chloe: Yeah. This is messed up.
[Message 65] Anya: I'm calling the police now.
[Message 66] Chloe: Good. Let me know what they say.
[Message 67] Anya: Will do.
[Message 68] Liam: Hey guys, you still up?
[Message 69] Chloe: Just about to head to bed. What's up?
[Message 70] Anya: Yeah, almost asleep.
[Message 71] Liam: Just wanted to say…I’m really shaken up by this.
[Message 72] Chloe: We all are, Liam.
[Message 73] Anya: It's a terrible thing.
[Message 74] Liam: Yeah. Terrible. Hey, Anya, did you ever hear Samira talking about anyone…troubling?
[Message 75] Anya: Troubling? No, not really. Why?
[Message 76] Liam: Just wondering if she had any enemies or something.
[Message 77] Chloe: Why would she have enemies? She seemed nice.
[Message 78] Liam: You never know, right? People hide things.
[Message 79] Anya: True. But I didn't hear anything.
[Message 80] Chloe: Me neither.
[Message 81] Liam: Okay. Just a thought.
[Message 82] Anya: Get some rest, Liam.
[Message 83] Chloe: Yeah, night.
[Message 84] Liam: Night.
[Message 85] Anya: He’s totally trying to deflect.
[Message 86] Chloe: I know! He’s aware that he is under pressure. What a creep.
[Message 87] Anya: The police are on their way to his place.
[Message 88] Chloe: Good. Hopefully, they’ll find something.
[Message 89] Anya: Me too.
[Message 90] Chloe: Keep me updated.
[Message 91] Anya: Always will.
[Message 92] Chloe: This is insane.
[Message 93] Anya: Completely.
[Message 94] Liam: Hey, you guys still awake?
[Message 95] Anya: What is it, Liam?
[Message 96] Chloe: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 97] Liam: The police are here.
[Message 98] Anya: …
[Message 99] Chloe: …
[Message 100] Liam: They want to ask me some questions about Omar and Samira.
[Message 101] Anya: Just be honest, Liam.
[Message 102] Chloe: Yeah, tell them everything you know.
[Message 103] Liam: I will. I just…I’m scared.
[Message 104] Anya: Don't be scared if you have nothing to hide.
[Message 105] Chloe: Exactly.
[Message 106] Liam: Right. Right.
[Message 107] Anya: We’re here for you, Liam. No matter what.
[Message 108] Chloe: Yeah, we are.
[Message 109] Liam: Thanks. That means a lot. I saw him leave the building at Night.
[Message 110] Anya: Who are you talking about?
[Message 111] Chloe: Yes, who?
[Message 112] Liam: Omar, I saw him leave the Mosque. I failed to call 911 after he left. I thought he was okay.
[Message 113] Anya: What?! Why didn't you say anything before?!
[Message 114] Chloe: Liam, you need to tell the police this NOW.
[Message 115] Liam: I'm going to.
[Message 116] Anya: Good.
[Message 117] Chloe: Let us know what happens.
[Message 118] Liam: I will. Thanks, guys. For everything.
[Message 119] Anya: Of course, Liam.
[Message 120] Chloe: Always.

...","[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey everyone, so sad about what happened to Sarah... unbelievable.

[Message 2] MARK: Yeah, Chloe, it's awful. I can't believe it.

[Message 3] LIAM: Terrible. She was always so optimistic. Remember that time she organized the Airport clean-up?

[Message 4] ANNA: It is insane. Predawn?! Seriously? I was asleep.

[Message 5] JAKE: Yeah, I heard. Rough stuff. Anyone know any details?

[Message 6] CHLOE: Not really, just what's on the news. So scary this happened in Shreveport.

[Message 7] MARK: They're saying it was strangulation.

[Message 8] LIAM: Asphyxiation by strangulation, right? Brutal.

[Message 9] ANNA: That's horrible. Poor Sarah.

[Message 10] JAKE: Sounds like they're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 11] CHLOE: Seriously! I can't even imagine. Hey, anyone free for coffee later?

[Message 12] MARK: Can't, got a meeting. Maybe tomorrow?

[Message 13] LIAM: I’m in, Chloe! Need to get my mind off this.

[Message 14] ANNA: I’m good for coffee.

[Message 15] JAKE: Maybe later. Got errands.

[Message 16] CHLOE: Okay, Liam, Anna, let's say 3pm at Java Java?

[Message 17] MARK: Quick question, did anyone see David (Suspect 1) around yesterday? He wasn't at work.

[Message 18] LIAM: Java Java sounds good.

[Message 19] ANNA: Sounds great! See you then.

[Message 20] JAKE: David? Nah.

[Message 21] CHLOE: David called in sick. He mentioned he had a bad cough last week.

[Message 22] MARK: That's right. Completely forgot.

[Message 23] LIAM: Bad cough doesn’t equal…this.

[Message 24] ANNA: Exactly, Liam. People get sick.

[Message 25] JAKE: True. So, back to normal life then?

[Message 26] CHLOE: Not really, Jake, someone died.

[Message 27] MARK: This whole thing is just unsettling. I had drinks with Sarah last week.

[Message 28] LIAM: Really? Where?

[Message 29] ANNA: Seriously, Mark? Why would you bring that up?

[Message 30] JAKE: Yeah, dude. Little insensitive.

[Message 31] CHLOE: Mark, maybe keep that to yourself for now.

[Message 32] MARK: I didn't mean anything by it. Just saying. We talked about her plans for her activist work. She was so passionate.

[Message 33] LIAM: Okay, fair enough.

[Message 34] ANNA: Just be careful what you say, Mark.

[Message 35] JAKE: Word. So anyone know Kevin (Suspect 3)?

[Message 36] CHLOE: Vaguely. Works downtown, right?

[Message 37] MARK: Yeah, I think I've seen him around. Why?

[Message 38] LIAM: Kevin? Isn't he the one with… issues?

[Message 39] ANNA: Issues? What kind of issues?

[Message 40] JAKE: Heard he's got a temper.

[Message 41] CHLOE: Oh great, now we're speculating. This is getting us nowhere.

[Message 42] MARK: Just trying to figure things out, Chloe.

[Message 43] LIAM: Me too. Just trying to make sense of this.

[Message 44] ANNA: Let the police do their job.

[Message 45] JAKE: Yeah, good point.

[Message 46] CHLOE: Okay, let's drop it. See you guys later.

[Message 47] MARK: Later.

[Message 48] LIAM: Later.

[Message 49] ANNA: Bye.

[Message 50] JAKE: Peace.

[Message 51] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) Hey, you free to chat later tonight? Something’s bothering me.

[Message 52] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) Sure, what's up?

[Message 53] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) I don't want to say it in the group, but I saw Kevin leaving Sarah’s building at predawn that night.

[Message 54] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) Seriously? You saw him?

[Message 55] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) Yeah. Positive. He looked… agitated.

[Message 56] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) Oh my god. You have to tell the police.

[Message 57] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) I know, I know. Just wanted to tell someone first.

[Message 58] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) I understand. This is huge. Do you know why Kevin always hated her?

[Message 59] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) I think it was something about his business. Sarah’s activism was interfering with it.

[Message 60] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) Makes sense. Call them, Liam. Please.

[Message 61] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) Okay, I will. Thanks, Anna.

[Message 62] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) Hey Chloe, you think Liam knows something he's not saying?

[Message 63] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) What do you mean?

[Message 64] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) Just seems like he's acting weird. He kept pushing about where I had drinks with Sarah.

[Message 65] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) He’s probably just worried like the rest of us. Don't read too much into it.

[Message 66] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) Maybe you’re right. Just a feeling.

[Message 67] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) Focus on remembering everything you discussed with Sarah. That'll be more helpful.

[Message 68] JAKE: (Private message to DAVID) Yo, you good? Heard you called out sick yesterday.

[Message 69] DAVID: (Private message to JAKE) Yeah, man, just a bad cold. Thanks for checking in.

[Message 70] JAKE: (Private message to DAVID) No prob. Stay hydrated. You hear about Sarah?

[Message 71] DAVID: (Private message to JAKE) Yeah, awful. Crazy.

[Message 72] JAKE: (Private message to DAVID) Fr. Heard it was strangulation. Hope they catch the creep.

[Message 73] DAVID: (Private message to JAKE) Me too. Catch you later.

[Message 74] JAKE: (Private message to DAVID) Aight.

[Message 75] ANNA: (Group Chat) Has anyone heard from the police yet?

[Message 76] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Not me. I guess they’re still investigating.

[Message 77] MARK: (Group Chat) I haven't either.

[Message 78] LIAM: (Group Chat) Nope.

[Message 79] JAKE: (Group Chat) Nah.

[Message 80] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Maybe we should all be prepared to answer questions.

[Message 81] MARK: (Group Chat) Good point, Chloe.

[Message 82] LIAM: (Group Chat) Yeah, probably a good idea.

[Message 83] ANNA: (Group Chat) Definitely.

[Message 84] JAKE: (Group Chat) Whatever.

[Message 85] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Anyone know if Sarah had any enemies?

[Message 86] MARK: (Group Chat) Not that I know of. Everyone loved her.

[Message 87] LIAM: (Group Chat) She was pretty outspoken. That might have rubbed some people the wrong way.

[Message 88] ANNA: (Group Chat) Liam has a point. Activists often make enemies.

[Message 89] JAKE: (Group Chat) Maybe someone she protested?

[Message 90] CHLOE: (Group Chat) That's a good line of inquiry for the police.

[Message 91] MARK: (Group Chat) I still can't believe this happened. It feels surreal.

[Message 92] LIAM: (Group Chat) I keep thinking about her family. They must be devastated.

[Message 93] ANNA: (Group Chat) Absolutely heartbreaking.

[Message 94] JAKE: (Group Chat) Sucks.

[Message 95] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Okay, let’s try to focus on something else for a bit. This is getting too heavy.

[Message 96] MARK: (Group Chat) Agreed. Movie night at my place this weekend?

[Message 97] LIAM: (Group Chat) I’m in!

[Message 98] ANNA: (Group Chat) Sounds good.

[Message 99] JAKE: (Group Chat) Maybe. Depends.

[Message 100] CHLOE: (Group Chat) I’ll bring the popcorn!

[Message 101] ANNA: (Private message to MARK) You okay? You seem really shaken up about Sarah.

[Message 102] MARK: (Private message to ANNA) I am. We were friends. It’s just… I feel like I should have seen something.

[Message 103] ANNA: (Private message to MARK) You couldn't have known, Mark. Don't blame yourself.

[Message 104] MARK: (Private message to ANNA) I just keep thinking about what we talked about. About how she was trying to expose some shady dealings downtown.

[Message 105] ANNA: (Private message to MARK) Shady dealings? What do you mean?

[Message 106] MARK: (Private message to ANNA) I don’t know all the details. Something about Kevin’s business practices.

[Message 107] ANNA: (Private message to MARK) Kevin again? This is getting strange.

[Message 108] MARK: (Private message to ANNA) I know, right? But I don’t want to jump to conclusions.

[Message 109] ANNA: (Private message to MARK) Me neither. But it’s definitely worth mentioning to the police.

[Message 110] MARK: (Private message to ANNA) I will. Thanks, Anna.

[Message 111] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Hey, you doing okay? You seemed pretty upset earlier.

[Message 112] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Yeah, just a lot to process. Thanks for asking.

[Message 113] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Of course. Anything I can do?

[Message 114] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Not really. Just… try to be normal, I guess.

[Message 115] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Easier said than done, right? But I’ll try.

[Message 116] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Appreciate it.

[Message 117] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Get some rest. We’ll talk soon.

[Message 118] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Thanks, David. You too.

[Message 119] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) Just got off the phone with the police. Told them everything I saw.

[Message 120] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) Good for you, Liam. You did the right thing.

[Message 121] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) I hope so. I feel terrible.

[Message 122] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) You did what you could. It’s not your fault, no matter what Kevin’s mens rea was.

[Message 123] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) Thanks, Anna.

[Message 124] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) Police just called me. Asking me to come in for questioning tomorrow.

[Message 125] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) Okay. Just be honest and tell them everything you know.

[Message 126] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) I will. I’m just nervous.

[Message 127] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) It’s okay to be nervous. Just stay calm and tell the truth.

[Message 128] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) I will. Thanks, Chloe. You’re a good friend.

[Message 129] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) Anytime, Mark.

[Message 130] JAKE: (Private message to ANNA) Heard Liam snitched on Kevin (Suspect 3). True?

[Message 131] ANNA: (Private message to JAKE) I can't confirm or deny anything.

[Message 132] JAKE: (Private message to ANNA) Figures. This whole thing is messed up.

[Message 133] ANNA: (Private message to JAKE) Agreed.

[Message 134] JAKE: (Private message to ANNA) Hope they sort it out soon.

[Message 135] ANNA: (Private message to JAKE) Me too.

[Message 136] LIAM: (Group Chat) Anyone else get a call from the police?

[Message 137] ANNA: (Group Chat) Not yet.

[Message 138] CHLOE: (Group Chat) No.

[Message 139] MARK: (Group Chat) I did. Going in tomorrow.

[Message 140] JAKE: (Group Chat) Sheesh.

[Message 141] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Good luck, Mark.

[Message 142] ANNA: (Group Chat) Yeah, good luck.

[Message 143] LIAM: (Group Chat) Let us know how it goes.

[Message 144] MARK: (Group Chat) Will do.

[Message 145] JAKE: (Group Chat) Whatever.

[Message 146] CHLOE: (Private message to LIAM) Are you okay with Mark going in for questioning? He seemed a little weirded out when you were asking questions.

[Message 147] LIAM: (Private message to CHLOE) I'm fine. If he saw something, he needs to say it. It's the right thing to do, even if it’s hard. It's important for causation. I just want the right people to be punished.

[Message 148] CHLOE: (Private message to LIAM) True. I guess.

[Message 149] LIAM: (Private message to CHLOE) How are you holding up?

[Message 150] CHLOE: (Private message to LIAM) As well as can be expected. Thanks for asking.

[Message 151] LIAM: (Private message to CHLOE) Anytime. We'll get through this.

[Message 152] CHLOE: (Private message to LIAM) I hope so.

[Message 153] JAKE: (Group Chat) So, what's everyone having for dinner? Distract ourselves.

[Message 154] ANNA: (Group Chat) Pizza.

[Message 155] MARK: (Group Chat) Probably just a sandwich. Too stressed to cook.

[Message 156] LIAM: (Group Chat) Same. Cereal maybe.

[Message 157] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Ordering in some Thai.

[Message 158] JAKE: (Group Chat) Nice. I'm thinking burgers.

[Message 159] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Hey, I just wanted to let you know that Mark is going to the police station tomorrow to answer some questions.

[Message 160] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

[Message 161] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) I just thought you should be aware.

[Message 162] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) I appreciate it.

[Message 163] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) How are you feeling? Any better?

[Message 164] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) A little. Still coughing.

[Message 165] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Get some rest. Drink plenty of fluids.

[Message 166] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Will do. Thanks again.

[Message 167] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Anytime.

[Message 168] JAKE: (Private message to KEVIN) Yo, heard Liam told the cops you were at Sarah's (Victim's) the night she died. You in trouble bro?

[Message 169] KEVIN: (Private message to JAKE) That lying scumbag! I'm gonna make him pay for this. He probably INTENDED for this to happen and is now putting it on me.

[Message 170] JAKE: (Private message to KEVIN) Damn, so you DID go there?

[Message 171] KEVIN: (Private message to JAKE) Doesn't matter what happened. That loser better watch his back.

[Message 172] JAKE: (Private message to KEVIN) Alright man, just stay cool. Don't do anything stupid.

[Message 173] KEVIN: (Private message to JAKE) Too late for that.

[Message 174] JAKE: (Private message to KEVIN) ...

[Message 175] DAVID: (Private message to JAKE) If Kevin goes down for this, I'm going down with him. That stupid activist wouldn't leave him alone. This is all her fault.

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, Chloe. Just tired. Long week at the office.
[Message 3] Maya: Office? You're still doing that catering gig, right?
[Message 4] Liam: Right, catering. Brain fart.
[Message 5] Chloe: How's it going? Any interesting events lately?
[Message 6] Liam: Nah, same old. Weddings, corporate things. Nothing exciting.
[Message 7] Maya: Did you hear about what happened Overpass last night?
[Message 8] Chloe: Yeah, it’s awful. Poor Alex and Jordan.
[Message 9] Liam: Terrible. Two people… just gone.
[Message 10] Maya: Alex was always so cynical, but Jordan didn't deserve that.
[Message 11] Chloe: What do you think happened? Any leads?
[Message 12] Maya: Rumor is it was a robbery gone wrong.
[Message 13] Liam: Could be. Overpass isn’t the safest area.
[Message 14] Chloe: True. Still, it's shocking.
[Message 15] Maya: I heard the security guard, Alex, was arguing with someone a few days ago. Big fight.
[Message 16] Liam: Really? About what?
[Message 17] Maya: No clue. Just overheard snippets. Something about money, maybe?
[Message 18] Chloe: You think that has anything to do with it?
[Message 19] Maya: Who knows? Could be a coincidence.
[Message 20] Liam: I need to get some sleep. Talk later.
[Message 21] Chloe: Sure, Liam. Get some rest.
[Message 22] Maya: Night.
[Message 23] Chloe: Maya, you think Liam knows more than he’s letting on?
[Message 24] Maya: He’s been acting weird lately. Distant.
[Message 25] Chloe: Yeah, I noticed.
[Message 26] Maya: Remember how he hated Alex? Always complaining about his attitude.
[Message 27] Chloe: Yeah, but hating someone and… well…
[Message 28] Maya: I know, I know. Just saying.
[Message 29] Chloe: What about Sarah? She worked with Jordan at the newspaper.
[Message 30] Maya: Good point. She might know something.
[Message 31] Chloe: I’ll text her.
[Message 32] Maya: Let me know what she says.
[Message 33] Chloe: Hey Sarah, you okay? Heard about Jordan.
[Message 34] Sarah: Devastated, Chloe. She was a good friend. And a great journalist.
[Message 35] Chloe: Did she ever mention anyone who might want to hurt her?
[Message 36] Sarah: She was working on a big story, about some local politician's shady dealings.
[Message 37] Chloe: Whoa, seriously?
[Message 38] Sarah: Yeah. She said she was close to exposing him. ""I intended to get rid of him"", she said.
[Message 39] Chloe: Do you know who the politician was?
[Message 40] Sarah: I’m not sure. She kept it pretty close to the vest. Afraid of leaks.
[Message 41] Chloe: Maybe that’s why this happened. To silence her.
[Message 42] Sarah: It’s possible. Hope they don't get the death penalty if it is.
[Message 43] Chloe: I hope they find out who did this. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 44] Sarah: Me too. Justice for Jordan. And Alex, even if I didn't know him well.
[Message 45] Chloe: Thanks, Sarah. Let me know if you remember anything else.
[Message 46] Sarah: Will do.
[Message 47] Chloe: Maya, Sarah said Jordan was about to expose a politician.
[Message 48] Maya: See? I told you there was more to it than a robbery.
[Message 49] Chloe: This could be huge.
[Message 50] Maya: We should tell the police.
[Message 51] Chloe: Already did. Gave them Sarah's name too.
[Message 52] Maya: Good.
[Message 53] Liam: Hey, what are you guys talking about?
[Message 54] Chloe: Just about the murders.
[Message 55] Liam: Oh. Right. Still can't believe it.
[Message 56] Maya: You seemed pretty quick to write it off as a robbery, Liam.
[Message 57] Liam: Well, what else could it be? It’s Augusta.
[Message 58] Chloe: Jordan was about to expose a politician.
[Message 59] Liam: A politician? Seriously?
[Message 60] Maya: That's what we heard.
[Message 61] Liam: Wow. That changes things.
[Message 62] Chloe: You okay, Liam? You’re sweating.
[Message 63] Liam: Just… hot in here.
[Message 64] Maya: You saw him leave the building at Late Evening, didn't you, Liam? You were at the scene.
[Message 65] Liam: What? No! I was at home, watching TV.
[Message 66] Chloe: You sure about that, Liam?
[Message 67] Liam: Positive. Why would I lie?
[Message 68] Chloe: I don't know, Liam. You tell me.
[Message 69] Maya: Maybe he was just trying to prevent the victim from exposing a secret.
[Message 70] Liam: Guys, this is crazy. I had nothing to do with it.
[Message 71] Chloe: What were you watching on TV last night?
[Message 72] Liam: Uh… I don’t remember.
[Message 73] Maya: See? He’s lying.
[Message 74] Liam: I’m not lying! I’m just… stressed.
[Message 75] Chloe: Stressed about what, Liam?
[Message 76] Liam: Just… everything. This whole situation.
[Message 77] Maya: He always hated Alex. Maybe it was revenge for a past wrong.
[Message 78] Liam: I didn’t… I wouldn’t…
[Message 79] Chloe: You wouldn’t what, Liam? Finish the sentence.
[Message 80] Liam: I wouldn’t hurt anyone.
[Message 81] Maya: Except Alex, right? You always said you wanted to get rid of him.
[Message 82] Liam: That was just talk! I didn’t mean it literally.
[Message 83] Chloe: But you knew Alex, right? You knew about his tremor in hands?
[Message 84] Liam: What's that got to do with anything?
[Message 85] Chloe: Nothing, just curious.
[Message 86] Maya: You should call the police, Liam. Tell them everything you know.
[Message 87] Liam: I already told them everything!
[Message 88] Chloe: Did you tell them you were at Overpass last night?
[Message 89] Liam: No! Because I wasn’t!
[Message 90] Maya: Just admit it, Liam. It’ll be easier in the long run.
[Message 91] Liam: I have nothing to admit!
[Message 92] Chloe: Well, someone needs to pay for what happened to Alex and Jordan.
[Message 93] Maya: I think the police are already on their way, Liam.
[Message 94] Liam: What? Why?
[Message 95] Chloe: Because we told them everything.

[Message 2] Mark: Yeah, just tired. Long week. How's the dog?
[Message 3] Sarah: Buster's good. Ate my shoe again, haha. You hear about what happened at Church?
[Message 4] Mark: Church? No, what happened?
[Message 5] Sarah: Horrible. They found Dale and Alex both dead.
[Message 6] Mark: What?! Dale and Alex? What are you talking about?
[Message 7] Sarah: Murdered. I guess it happened last night.
[Message 8] Mark: That's awful. Poor Dale. He always was so creative, even when things were rough.
[Message 9] Sarah: And Alex, too. So stubborn, but always fighting for what he believed in.
[Message 10] Mark: I didn't know them well. I think I saw Dale at the coffee shop once or twice.
[Message 11] Sarah: You must have seen Alex at the rallies. He was always there.
[Message 12] Mark: Right, vaguely. So, what happened exactly?
[Message 13] Sarah: I don't know all the details, but I heard it was violent. The police are investigating.
[Message 14] Mark: They'll probably be going after his partners.
[Message 15] Sarah: His partners? I'm not sure i follow you.
[Message 16] Mark: Nevermind.
[Message 17] Sarah: This is insane. I can't believe this happened in Reading.
[Message 18] Mark: Reading's changing, Sarah. Not for the better, either.
[Message 19] Sarah: True. Listen, I gotta run. Grocery shopping. Talk later?
[Message 20] Mark: Sure, later.

[Message 21] Jenny: Did you hear about Dale and Alex?
[Message 22] Chloe: Yeah, it's all over the news. Awful.
[Message 23] Jenny: I saw Brenda at the bakery yesterday. She looked distraught.
[Message 24] Chloe: Brenda? Why? Was she close to them?
[Message 25] Jenny: I don't know, but she kept muttering about ""accidents"" and ""going too far."" Weird.
[Message 26] Chloe: ""Accidents""? That's suspicious.
[Message 27] Jenny: I know, right? I also heard she was buying Strangulation with a rope at the store
[Message 28] Chloe: What! She bought what?
[Message 29] Jenny:Strangulation with a rope. I don't want to spread rumors, but I am a bit nervous because she was also talking about wanting to get rid of someone.
[Message 30] Chloe: OMG Jenny! Did you tell the police?
[Message 31] Jenny: I might if I am not mistaken. I am very afraid right now.
[Message 32] Chloe: Yes, you must.

[Message 33] David: Hey, it's David. You busy?
[Message 34] Frank: Not really. What's up?
[Message 35] David: Did you hear about Dale and Alex?
[Message 36] Frank: Yeah, terrible. What a waste.
[Message 37] David: I saw you near Church last night. Everything okay?
[Message 38] Frank: I was just taking a walk. Needed some air. I have a distinctive gait, you know.
[Message 39] David: At that hour?
[Message 40] Frank: Look, I didn't do anything. Don't try to pin this on me.
[Message 41] David: Nobody's pinning anything. Just asking a question.
[Message 42] Frank: Well, I resent the implication. I wouldn't hurt anyone.
[Message 43] David: Relax, Frank. I just... I'm shaken up about all this.

[Message 44] Chloe: Did you hear Brenda tried to talk him out of it.
[Message 45] Jenny: Frank? He was looking up how to make Strangulation with a rope online
[Message 46] Chloe: What are we going to do? They are going away for a long time for this
[Message 47] Jenny: We have to make a choice here

[Message 48] Brenda: Hey, it's Brenda. Can we talk?
[Message 49] Susan: Sure, what's up?
[Message 50] Brenda: It's about... everything. I'm scared, Susan.
[Message 51] Susan: Scared? About what? The murders?
[Message 52] Brenda: Yes! And... other things. I saw Frank leave the building at Night.
[Message 53] Susan: Frank? From the activist group? What was he doing there?
[Message 54] Brenda: I don't know! I just... I had a bad feeling. He said he wanted to get rid of him.
[Message 55] Susan: You need to go to the police, Brenda. This is serious.
[Message 56] Brenda: I can't! I... I was there too. I was intending to buy Strangulation with a rope at the store and now everyone will suspect I did it.
[Message 57] Susan: What? Brenda, what are you saying?
[Message 58] Brenda: I... it was an accident. I swear. I just wanted to... protect someone.

[Message 59] Mark: Hey Sarah, you still up?
[Message 60] Sarah: Yeah, just watching TV. What's up?
[Message 61] Mark: Just thinking about Dale and Alex. Crazy, right?
[Message 62] Sarah: Totally. Did you know them at all?
[Message 63] Mark: Not really. I heard Dale had a temper, though.
[Message 64] Sarah: Really? I didn't know that.
[Message 65] Mark: Just rumors. Anyway, goodnight.
[Message 66] Sarah: Night.

[Message 67] Brenda: Please, you have to believe me.
[Message 68] Susan: What happened, Brenda? Tell me everything.
[Message 69] Brenda: It was Frank. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there. I tried to stop him. I swear I did. I didn't realize he was so angry.
[Message 70] Susan: And Dale? What about Dale?
[Message 71] Brenda: I don't know! I only saw Frank. I panicked. I should have called 911 after Dale was hurt. Everything would have been different.
[Message 72] Susan: The police need to know this, Brenda.

[Message 73] Frank: David, we need to talk.
[Message 74] David: About what, Frank?
[Message 75] Frank: About keeping our mouths shut. They're going to blame both of us.
[Message 76] David: About Church? What are you talking about?
[Message 77] Frank: Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened
[Message 78] David: I didn't even know them.
[Message 79] Frank: Just... just don't say anything.

[Message 80] Brenda: I need a lawyer.

...","[Message 1] Liam: Hey Maya, you hear about what happened at the gallery?
[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. Recognize anyone?
[Message 3] Liam: No, thank god. Just hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 4] Chloe: Heard it on the news. Brutal. Anyone know the victims?
[Message 5] Maya: I think I saw the Bartender, Daniel, around a few times. Seemed like an okay guy.
[Message 6] Liam: Daniel? Yeah, I think I served him once or twice.
[Message 7] Chloe: The manager was a woman right? What was her name?
[Message 8] Maya: Security Guard was Anna, I think. Always had that cynical look, poor thing.
[Message 9] Liam: Yeah, Anna. Sad.
[Message 10] Chloe: Anyway, I'm swamped. Catch you later.
[Message 11] Liam: Later.
[Message 12] Maya: Later Chloe.
[Message 13] Liam: Maya, you going to the memorial service?
[Message 14] Maya: Probably. Shows respect, right? You?
[Message 15] Liam: Yeah, thinking about it.
[Message 16] Maya: Good. It's today at 2 pm right?
[Message 17] Liam: I think so. Heard a rumor that the guy who was fired last week was seen leaving the gallery late morning.
[Message 18] Maya: Oh really? That's suspicious. What was his name?
[Message 19] Liam: Greg, I think.
[Message 20] Maya: Greg... I don't recognize the name.
[Message 21] Chloe: Did someone say Greg? What about him?
[Message 22] Liam: Just heard he might be a suspect.
[Message 23] Chloe: Well, hopefully they find out what happened. It’s terrible for Anna.
[Message 24] Maya: Agreed.
[Message 25] Liam: So, service at 2? I can give you a ride.
[Message 26] Maya: Sure, sounds good. I’ll see you there.
[Message 27] Liam: Perfect.
[Message 28] Chloe: Need to get back to work. Talk later.
[Message 29] Liam: Later.
[Message 30] Maya: Bye.
[Message 31] Liam: This whole thing is just messed up.
[Message 32] Maya: Tell me about it. What did you hear about Anna?
[Message 33] Liam: Just that she was always on edge. Apparently, Greg was obsessed with her.
[Message 34] Maya: Wow, really? That changes things.
[Message 35] Liam: Yeah, seems like a solid motive. He intended to do something stupid, probably.
[Message 36] Maya: Hope they catch him fast.
[Message 37] Liam: Me too. Hey, you see that new exhibit downtown?
[Message 38] Maya: No, what’s it like?
[Message 39] Liam: Really cool, modern stuff. You should check it out sometime.
[Message 40] Maya: I might, thanks for the tip.
[Message 41] Liam: No problem.
[Message 42] Chloe: Anyone know what time the gallery opened that morning?
[Message 43] Liam: Not sure, Chloe. Probably around 9 or 10?
[Message 44] Maya: Maybe earlier for staff?
[Message 45] Chloe: True. Just curious.
[Message 46] Liam: So, you thinking of going to the service too, Chloe?
[Message 47] Chloe: Maybe. Depends on work.
[Message 48] Maya: Understandable.
[Message 49] Liam: Alright, gotta run. See you at 2, Maya.
[Message 50] Maya: See ya.
[Message 51] Chloe: Later.
[Message 52] Maya: Later.
[Message 53] Maya: (Later that evening) Hey Liam, something's bugging me.
[Message 54] Liam: What's up?
[Message 55] Maya: Chloe seemed really interested in the gallery's opening time.
[Message 56] Liam: Yeah, I noticed that too. Weird, right?
[Message 57] Maya: I don't know... just a feeling.
[Message 58] Liam: Maybe she knew Daniel or Anna?
[Message 59] Maya: Maybe. Or maybe she knows something we don't.
[Message 60] Liam: You think she was there?
[Message 61] Maya: I don’t know! But she was buying Pushing from a height at the store yesterday.
[Message 62] Liam: Pushing from a height? What does that mean?
[Message 63] Maya: Never mind. Wrong Pushing from a height. Just a figure of speech.
[Message 64] Liam: Okay... You going to the police with this?
[Message 65] Maya: Not yet. Just wanted to see what you thought.
[Message 66] Liam: Good call. Let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 67] Maya: Agreed.
[Message 68] Chloe: What are you two up to?
[Message 69] Liam: Just talking about the service.
[Message 70] Chloe: Oh. Anything interesting?
[Message 71] Maya: Not really.
[Message 72] Chloe: Okay. Just checking in.
[Message 73] Liam: Everything alright, Chloe?
[Message 74] Chloe: Yeah, fine. Why?
[Message 75] Liam: Just seemed a little…intense.
[Message 76] Chloe: I'm fine. Leave it alone, Liam.
[Message 77] Maya: Alright, alright. Everyone calm down.
[Message 78] Liam: Sorry, Chloe. Just concerned.
[Message 79] Chloe: Whatever.
[Message 80] Maya: Maybe we should all just get some sleep.
[Message 81] Liam: Good idea. Night.
[Message 82] Maya: Night.
[Message 83] Chloe: Night.
[Message 84] Liam: (The next day) Maya, you free for coffee?
[Message 85] Maya: Yeah, sure. When?
[Message 86] Liam: How about in an hour? Same place?
[Message 87] Maya: Sounds good. See you then.
[Message 88] Liam: Perfect.
[Message 89] Chloe: Coffee? Fun!
[Message 90] Liam: Just catching up with Maya.
[Message 91] Chloe: Oh. Okay.
[Message 92] Maya: See you in an hour, Liam.
[Message 93] Liam: Yep.
[Message 94] Chloe: Have fun.
[Message 95] Maya: (After coffee) Liam, I’m seriously worried about Chloe.
[Message 96] Liam: Me too. She's acting really strange.
[Message 97] Maya: I'm going to look into it more.
[Message 98] Liam: Be careful, Maya.
[Message 99] Maya: I will.
[Message 100] Liam: Let me know if you find anything.
[Message 101] Maya: Definitely.
[Message 102] Chloe: What are you two planning?
[Message 103] Maya: Just talking about work.
[Message 104] Chloe: Right.
[Message 105] Liam: Yeah, nothing to worry about, Chloe.
[Message 106] Chloe: I hope not.
[Message 107] Maya: Chloe, why were you asking about the gallery's opening time?
[Message 108] Chloe: I told you, just curious.
[Message 109] Maya: Curious enough to ask repeatedly?
[Message 110] Chloe: Look, it's none of your business, okay?
[Message 111] Liam: Woah, Chloe. Calm down.
[Message 112] Chloe: I AM CALM! Just leave me alone.
[Message 113] Maya: Fine. But if you know something, you need to tell the police. Anna and Daniel deserve justice.
[Message 114] Chloe: I don't know anything!
[Message 115] Liam: Okay, Chloe. We believe you.
[Message 116] Chloe: Good.
[Message 117] Maya: I’m going to call the police.
[Message 118] Liam: Careful.
[Message 119] Maya: I am.
[Message 120] Chloe: This is ridiculous.
[Message 121] Liam: Let her do what she needs to do, Chloe.
[Message 122] Chloe: Whatever.
[Message 123] Maya: (Later that night) Liam, police are questioning Greg.
[Message 124] Liam: Good. Hope he cracks.
[Message 125] Maya: Me too.
[Message 126] Chloe: I hope they find the real killer.
[Message 127] Liam: Me too, Chloe. Me too.
[Message 128] Maya: (A week later) Liam, the police released Greg.
[Message 129] Liam: What?! Why?
[Message 130] Maya: Not enough evidence.
[Message 131] Liam: Unbelievable.
[Message 132] Chloe: I knew he was innocent.
[Message 133] Maya: You seemed pretty sure of that, Chloe.
[Message 134] Chloe: I just had a feeling.
[Message 135] Liam: A feeling?
[Message 136] Maya: So, if they hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened. Right Chloe?
[Message 137] Chloe: What is that supposed to mean?!
[Message 138] Liam: Maya, don't push it.
[Message 139] Maya: I'm just saying... it's convenient.
[Message 140] Chloe: I resent that! I wasn't even there.
[Message 141] Liam: Alright, alright. Let's just drop it.
[Message 142] Maya: Fine. But I'm not letting this go.
[Message 143] Chloe: You're obsessed, Maya.
[Message 144] Liam: Everyone just chill.
[Message 145] Maya: She said she wanted to get rid of him. And now he's gone. Causation?
[Message 146] Chloe: You are insane!
[Message 147] Liam: Maya, stop.
[Message 148] Maya: They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 149] Chloe: Liam, tell her to stop harassing me.
[Message 150] Liam: Maya, please.
[Message 151] Maya: Fine. But I know something's up.
[Message 152] Chloe: Good riddance.
[Message 153] Liam: Let's just focus on healing.
[Message 154] Maya: I hope they don't get the death penalty.
[Message 155] Chloe: Leave me alone.
[Message 156] Liam: I don't like where this is going.
[Message 157] Maya: They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 158] Chloe: Goodbye.
[Message 159] Liam: Think its over?
[Message 160] Maya: Almost certain that Chloe is involved.
[Message 161] Liam: How so?
[Message 162] Maya: She knew too much, too quickly. It was like she was aware.
[Message 163] Liam: What about what about Greg?
[Message 164] Maya: Red herring! A distraction, maybe even something purposefully
[Message 165] Liam: We should contact the police now.

[Message 8] Zara: Ugh, that's horrible.

[Message 9] Marcus: I heard whispers it was about some business deal gone wrong. People are saying.

[Message 10] Daniel: You hear everything, Marcus!

[Message 11] Marcus: Just saying what I heard. Anyway, Zara you are not safe walking.

[Message 12] Zara: I appreciate the concern, Marcus, I will walk with Pepper spray from now on.

[Message 13] Daniel: Stay safe guys

[Message 14] Marcus: I need to check out the location to see what happened.

[Message 15] Zara: Okay...be careful.

[Message 16] Daniel: Weird, Marcus. Why you need to go to the murder scene.

[Message 18] Zara: Ok.

[Message 19] Daniel: I feel bad for the family of the 2.  Security Guard

[Message 21] Zara: Does anyone knows the 2.  Security Guard's name?

[Message 22] Marcus: I think his name was James.

[Message 23] Daniel: Yeah, James. He always seemed a bit on edge, though.

[Message 24] Zara: Really? I never noticed.

[Message 25] Marcus: Maybe he was just anxious. It's a tough job.

[Message 26] Daniel: True. Anyway, anyone up for a movie tonight? Need a distraction.

[Message 27] Zara: Sounds good, Daniel. What are you thinking?

[Message 28] Marcus: Count me in too. Anything not horror.

[Message 29] Daniel: Agreed, no horror.

[Message 30] Zara: Perfect!

[Message 31] Daniel: Ok let me find a good movie.

[Message 32] Marcus: Did you hear that crazy preacher, Elijah, ranting about James a few weeks ago?

[Message 33] Zara: No! What did he say?

[Message 34] Daniel: Something about James being an abomination. Elijah's always saying crazy stuff.

[Message 35] Marcus: Yeah, but could be something.

[Message 36] Zara: That's awful.

[Message 37] Daniel: Agreed.

[Message 38] Marcus: Elijah always hated James. Mens Rea right there.

[Message 47] Zara: Alex? Really?

[Message 58] Marcus: In front of the Doctor's Office. Kai seemed really angry. Maybe shouted something that provoke him.

[Message 59] Zara: Maybe he did.

[Message 60] Daniel: That's not right Marcus.

[Message 61] Marcus: I'm just saying what I saw. I need to check what they have on cctv.

[Message 62] Zara: Why?

[Message 63] Daniel: Marcus, you are being weird.

[Message 64] Marcus: Leave me alone Daniel.

[Message 65] Zara: Stop it guys

[Message 66] Marcus: It's just that if James had called 911, he would be still alive.

[Message 67] Daniel: What are you talking about?

[Message 68] Zara: Exactly

[Message 69] Marcus: Forget it. I said too much.

[Message 70] Daniel: Exactly what is that?

[Message 97] Daniel: Okay.

[Message 98] Zara: Have fun.

[Message 102] Marcus: People are capable of everything.

[Message 103] Daniel: True.

[Message 114] Zara: I need to find my umbrella.

[Message 115] Daniel: Any ideas what is going on with him?

[Message 116] Zara: Not at all.

[Message 117] Daniel: He seems very curious about the case.

[Message 118] Zara: Exactly, that is what I am thinking

[Message 119] Daniel: Maybe he is trying to help?

[Message 120] Zara: Maybe...but it doesn't seem like it.

[Message 121] Daniel: That is what I think.

[Message 122] Zara: I am worried.

[Message 123] Daniel: Me too.

[Message 124] Zara: Should we tell the police?

[Message 125] Daniel: I don't know...what if we are wrong?

[Message 126] Zara: Exactly!

[Message 127] Daniel: Let's wait a bit.

[Message 128] Zara: I agree.

[Message 49] CHLOE: Seriously.
[Message 50] MARCUS: (To SARAH) Hey, can we talk? It’s important.
[Message 51] SARAH: What's up? You seem stressed.
[Message 52] MARCUS: It's about… about what happened.
[Message 53] SARAH: What are you talking about? I don't know anything.
[Message 54] MARCUS: Don't play dumb. You were there. You saw it.
[Message 55] SARAH: Saw what? I was at work all night.
[Message 56] MARCUS: You need to keep your mouth shut, Sarah. For your own good.
[Message 57] SARAH: Are you threatening me?
[Message 58] MARCUS: No, I'm warning you. This is serious. Very serious.
[Message 59] SARAH: I don't like this. I'm going.
[Message 60] MARCUS: Don't you dare walk away from me!
[Message 61] SARAH: (To ANNA) Hey, do you know Marcus?
[Message 62] ANNA: Yeah, I know him. Why?
[Message 63] SARAH: He's acting really weird. He was basically threatening me.
[Message 64] ANNA: What? What did he say?
[Message 65] SARAH: Something about seeing something, and keeping my mouth shut. It's freaking me out.
[Message 66] ANNA: About the shooting?
[Message 67] SARAH: I guess so. I don't know what's going on.
[Message 68] ANNA: That’s messed up. You should tell the police.
[Message 69] SARAH: I don't want to get involved.
[Message 70] ANNA: But if he's involved…
[Message 71] SARAH: I don't know! Maybe he's just stressed out about something else.
[Message 72] ANNA: Maybe. But be careful, okay?
[Message 73] SARAH: I will. Thanks.
[Message 74] MARCUS: (To CHLOE) Hey, you know Sarah, right?
[Message 75] CHLOE: Yeah, met her at Liam's party. Why?
[Message 76] MARCUS: She works at the dry cleaner, right?
[Message 77] CHLOE: Yeah. What about it?
[Message 78] MARCUS: Nothing. Just curious.
[Message 79] CHLOE: You seem weird. Is everything okay?

[Message 82] MARCUS: Will do. Thanks.
[Message 83] LIAM: (To SARAH) Hey, it's Liam from the party. How are you?
[Message 84] SARAH: Oh, hey! I’m okay. A little shaken up, to be honest.
[Message 85] LIAM: Yeah, I heard about what happened at your work. That’s awful.
[Message 86] SARAH: It is. I can't believe it.
[Message 87] LIAM: Is there anything I can do?
[Message 88] SARAH: Just keep me in your thoughts, I guess.
[Message 89] LIAM: Definitely. Hey, I was wondering…did you see anything weird that night?
[Message 90] SARAH: Weird? What do you mean?
[Message 91] LIAM: Like, anyone acting suspicious? Anyone you didn't recognize hanging around?
[Message 92] SARAH: I don't know… it was busy. I was just trying to do my job.
[Message 93] LIAM: Right, right. Sorry. Just trying to help.
[Message 94] SARAH: I appreciate it. I really do.
[Message 95] CHLOE: (To LIAM) Why were you asking Sarah about suspicious people?
[Message 96] LIAM: Just trying to be helpful. She seemed really scared.
[Message 97] CHLOE: You seemed really interested.
[Message 98] LIAM: What's that supposed to mean?
[Message 99] CHLOE: Nothing. Just an observation.
[Message 100] LIAM: Whatever.
[Message 101] ANNA: (To MARCUS) Sarah told me you were acting strange. What’s going on?
[Message 102] MARCUS: She's exaggerating. I just… I might have seen something that night.
[Message 103] ANNA: Saw what?
[Message 104] MARCUS: I don't want to talk about it.
[Message 105] ANNA: Marcus, you have to tell me. This is serious. If you saw something, you need to go to the police.
[Message 106] MARCUS: I can't. I'll get in trouble.
[Message 107] ANNA: Trouble for what? What did you do?
[Message 108] MARCUS: I didn't do anything! Just… I was there. Okay? I was there and I panicked.
[Message 109] ANNA: Panicked about what?
[Message 110] MARCUS: Just leave it alone, Anna. Please.
[Message 111] JAKE: (To ANNA) You seen Marcus? Still owes me money. I intended to have it by today.
[Message 112] ANNA: He’s acting strange. Something is going on with him. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 113] JAKE: What you mean?
[Message 114] ANNA: Never mind
[Message 115] CHLOE: (To LIAM) Hey, are you free?
[Message 116] LIAM: Yeah, why? What's up?
[Message 117] CHLOE: Want to grab a coffee? I need to talk.
[Message 118] LIAM: Sure, where?
[Message 119] CHLOE: How about that place near the stadium?
[Message 120] LIAM: Okay. See you in a bit.
[Message 121] ANNA: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 122] JAKE: Exactly, the manager deserves it.
[Message 123] MARCUS: (To ANNA) You won’t tell the police about me, right?
[Message 124] ANNA: I dont know Marcus, you Knew this would happen, you have to tell them!
[Message 125] MARCUS: Please don’t, I was protecting you!

[Message 2] Riley: Yeah, crazy. I saw it on the news. Some girl, right?

[Message 3] Jordan: Yeah, a girl named Sarah. Awful.

[Message 4] Alex: So sad. Poor kid.

[Message 5] Riley: Activist, they said?

[Message 6] Jordan: Yeah, that's what I heard.

[Message 7] Alex: Anyone know her? I didn't.

[Message 8] Riley: Nope. Just heard she was always withdrawn.

[Message 9] Jordan: Me neither. But I walk through there every day! Gives me the creeps now.

[Message 10] Alex: Seriously!

[Message 11] Riley: So, what now? Everyone’s a detective?

[Message 12] Jordan: Haha, pretty much.

[Message 13] Alex: Just trying to process it, I guess.

[Message 14] Riley: Me too. By the way, Alex, did you ever finish that woodworking project?

[Message 15] Alex: Not yet, been busy. Why?

[Message 16] Riley: Just curious.

[Message 17] Jordan: Omg, I was supposed to meet someone there Late Evening! But they cancelled last minute.

[Message 18] Alex: Whoa, Jordan, that's wild.

[Message 19] Riley: Seriously! Who were you meeting?

[Message 20] Jordan: Just a friend. It's not important now. It's irrelevant.

[Message 21] Alex: Still, kinda scary.

[Message 22] Riley: Agreed.

[Message 23] Jordan: Yeah. I’m just glad I wasn’t there.

[Message 24] Alex: True that. Lucky escape.

[Message 25] Riley: Anyway, anyone up for a movie later? Distract ourselves?

[Message 26] Jordan: I’m in. Need something to take my mind off things.

[Message 27] Alex: Can't, got plans. Maybe tomorrow?

[Message 28] Riley: Sure thing.

[Message 29] Jordan: Sounds good.

[Message 30] Alex: Talk later.

[Message 31] Riley: Bye.

[Message 32] Jordan: Later.

[Message 33] Riley: So, Jordan, everything okay? You seem a little off.

[Message 34] Jordan: Yeah, just shaken up about Sarah. That's all.

[Message 35] Riley: I get it. But you were supposed to meet someone RIGHT there? That’s… something.

[Message 36] Jordan: Look, it's nothing, okay? Just drop it.

[Message 37] Riley: Woah, okay. Just checking in.

[Message 38] Jordan: I appreciate it, but seriously, I'm fine.

[Message 39] Riley: Alright, alright.

[Message 40] Alex: Hey guys, sorry to bring it up again, but any news on the case?

[Message 41] Riley: Not that I've seen.

[Message 42] Jordan: Nothing new.

[Message 43] Alex: Just wondering if they have any leads.

[Message 44] Riley: They'll catch whoever did it. They always do.

[Message 45] Jordan: Hope so.

[Message 46] Alex: Me too.

[Message 47] Riley: Anyway, gotta run. Chat later.

[Message 48] Jordan: Later.

[Message 49] Alex: Bye.

[Message 50] Jordan: Riley, you still there?

[Message 51] Riley: Yeah?

[Message 52] Jordan: You believe me, right? About last night?

[Message 53] Riley: Of course, I do. Why wouldn't I?

[Message 54] Jordan: Just… needed to hear it, I guess.

[Message 55] Riley: No worries. Friends look out for each other.

[Message 56] Jordan: Thanks, Riley. I really appreciate that.

[Message 57] Riley: Anytime.

[Message 58] Alex: Guys, they just released a sketch of a person of interest.

[Message 59] Riley: Send it over!

[Message 60] Jordan: Yeah, let's see.

[Message 61] Alex: [Image of a blurry sketch with a large nose]

[Message 62] Riley: Wow, blurry. But… looks familiar somehow.

[Message 63] Jordan: Hmmm. Vague.

[Message 64] Alex: That nose is pretty distinctive, though.

[Message 65] Riley: True.

[Message 66] Jordan: Hard to say, could be anyone.

[Message 67] Alex: Wonder if they have any witnesses.

[Message 68] Riley: Probably.

[Message 69] Jordan: Hopefully, they catch this person soon.

[Message 70] Alex: Agreed.

[Message 71] Riley: So, Alex, you were out pretty late last night, weren’t you?

[Message 72] Alex: What? Where is this coming from?

[Message 73] Riley: Just asking. I thought I saw you near Sidewalk.

[Message 74] Alex: No, you didn't. I was at home.

[Message 75] Jordan: Whoa, awkward.

[Message 76] Riley: Just saying, Alex. No need to get defensive.

[Message 77] Alex: I'm not defensive! I just wasn't there. End of story.

[Message 78] Jordan: Okay, guys, let’s just calm down.

[Message 79] Riley: Fine by me.

[Message 80] Alex: Yeah, whatever.

[Message 81] Riley: Jordan, did you notice anything strange when you were near Sidewalk earlier? Before your friend cancelled?

[Message 82] Jordan: No, nothing. Just the usual.

[Message 83] Alex: You seem tense.

[Message 84] Jordan: I'm just tired, okay?

[Message 85] Riley: Alright.

[Message 86] Alex: I’m going to bed. This conversation is making me uncomfortable.

[Message 87] Riley: Goodnight.

[Message 88] Jordan: Night.

[Message 89] Riley: So, Jordan. You free to talk?

[Message 90] Jordan: About what?

[Message 91] Riley: Alex. You think he's involved?

[Message 92] Jordan: I don't know, Riley. He was acting weird, but...

[Message 93] Riley: He always hated activists. And he was covering up another crime. What if Sarah knew about it?

[Message 94] Jordan: That's a big accusation, Riley.

[Message 95] Riley: I know, but think about it.

[Message 96] Jordan: I don't want to think about it.

[Message 97] Riley: Okay, okay. Just… keep your eyes open, alright?

[Message 98] Jordan: Fine.

[Message 99] Riley: Good.

[Message 100] Alex: Hey, sorry about earlier. I was just stressed.

[Message 101] Riley: It's alright.

[Message 102] Jordan: Yeah, no worries.

[Message 103] Alex: So, what were you guys talking about after I left?

[Message 104] Riley: Nothing important. Just movie plans.

[Message 105] Jordan: Yeah, nothing.

[Message 106] Alex: Okay. Just curious.

[Message 107] Riley: So, you up for that movie tomorrow now?

[Message 108] Alex: Maybe. Depends on how I feel.

[Message 109] Jordan: Cool.

[Message 110] Riley: Alright.

[Message 111] Alex: This whole situation is just awful. I can’t even imagine what Sarah’s family is going through.

[Message 112] Riley: Yeah, terrible. Hope they give her justice. They're going away for a long time for this

[Message 113] Jordan: Agreed.

[Message 114] Riley: Hey Alex, did you get a new coat recently? Dark colored?

[Message 115] Alex: Yeah, why?

[Message 116] Riley: No reason. Just saw someone wearing one like it the other day.

[Message 117] Alex: Okay.

[Message 118] Jordan: Riley, leave him alone.

[Message 119] Riley: Just making conversation.

[Message 120] Jordan: Sure you are.

[Message 121] Alex: Seriously, what's going on?

[Message 122] Riley: Nothing, Alex. Just forget about it.

[Message 123] Jordan: Yeah, drop it, Alex.

[Message 124] Alex: Fine.

[Message 125] Riley: Jordan, I was thinking... maybe Sarah knew something about your canceled meeting?

[Message 126] Jordan: Absolutely not. Don't even go there. I was aware she's an activist.

[Message 127] Riley: Okay, just a thought.

[Message 128] Jordan: A stupid thought.

[Message 129] Riley: Alright.

[Message 130] Alex: Guys, I'm seriously getting creeped out. Can we talk about something else?

[Message 131] Riley: Sure thing. What do you want to talk about?

[Message 132] Jordan: Anything but this.

[Message 133] Alex: I don't know. Anything.

[Message 134] Riley: How about that woodworking project, Alex? Ever get around to buying Pushing from a height at the store?

[Message 135] Alex: I told you, not yet. Why are you so obsessed with that?

[Message 136] Jordan: Riley, you're being really weird.

[Message 137] Riley: I’m just trying to lighten the mood.

[Message 138] Alex: Well, you're not doing a very good job.

[Message 139] Riley: Alright, alright. I'll stop.

[Message 140] Jordan: Good.

[Message 141] Alex: Thanks.

[Message 142] Riley: Whatever.

[Message 143] Jordan: I’m gonna go for a walk. Need some fresh air.

[Message 144] Alex: Okay. Be careful.

[Message 145] Riley: Yeah, watch out for falling objects. Just kidding!

[Message 146] Jordan: Not funny, Riley.

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, just tired. Long day at work. You know how it is.
[Message 3] CHLOE: True. Speaking of, did you hear about what happened near the airport?
[Message 4] LIAM: Airport? No, what's up?
[Message 5] CHLOE: Some activist, Daniel, was shot. Dead.
[Message 6] LIAM: Wow, seriously? That's awful.
[Message 7] MIA: Chloe, you won't believe what Mr. Thompson said today! Promotion material is out!
[Message 8] CHLOE: OMG Mia! Congrats! We need to celebrate!
[Message 9] MIA: I know, right?! But later. Gotta prep this presentation. Hey, did you hear about Daniel?
[Message 10] CHLOE: Yeah, Liam just told me. Scary stuff.
[Message 11] LIAM: Makes you think, you know? Life's too short to be stressed about work.
[Message 12] MIA: Tell me about it. Thompson's been riding my back all week. I swear, I could kill him. (jk, obvs)
[Message 13] CHLOE: Lol, I feel that. So, Liam, what were you doing yesterday afternoon?
[Message 14] LIAM: Working, like I said. Why?
[Message 15] CHLOE: Just curious. Small town, everyone's a suspect, right?
[Message 16] LIAM: Ha, funny.
[Message 17] MIA: Seriously Chloe, not cool. People are grieving.
[Message 18] CHLOE: Sorry, sorry. Just trying to lighten the mood.
[Message 19] LIAM: It's fine. Really. Anyway, gotta run. Meeting.
[Message 20] CHLOE: Later. Mia, you free for drinks Friday?
[Message 21] MIA: Definitely! Need to vent about Thompson anyway.
[Message 22] JAKE: Yo, Mia. You hear about Daniel? Crazy.
[Message 23] MIA: Yeah, Jake. Chloe told me. What's your take?
[Message 24] JAKE: Dunno man. Bad for business around here. I heard he was causing trouble with some developers.
[Message 25] MIA: Developers? Interesting...
[Message 26] CHLOE: Jake, you know anything about that?
[Message 27] JAKE: Nah, just gossip. You know how it is.
[Message 28] CHLOE: True. Well, if you hear anything...
[Message 29] JAKE: Will do. Later.
[Message 30] MIA: Jake's acting weird.
[Message 31] CHLOE: Tell me about it. He was really chummy with Daniel last week.
[Message 32] MIA: Maybe he's just shocked.
[Message 33] CHLOE: Maybe. Hey, did Liam seem different to you too?
[Message 34] MIA: Different how?
[Message 35] CHLOE: Just... distant. Like he was hiding something.
[Message 36] MIA: You're being paranoid.
[Message 37] CHLOE: Probably. But still...
[Message 38] LIAM: Guys, this is getting out of hand. Leave it to the police.
[Message 39] CHLOE: We're just talking, Liam. Relax.
[Message 40] LIAM: Talking can turn into rumors. Just be careful.
[Message 41] MIA: Liam's right. Let's change the subject.
[Message 42] CHLOE: Fine. But something's definitely off.
[Message 43] JAKE: I saw Liam leaving the building near the airport around late afternoon yesterday.
[Message 44] MIA: Really, Jake? You sure?
[Message 45] JAKE: Pretty sure. He was walking fast.
[Message 46] CHLOE: Liam? What was that about?
[Message 47] LIAM: I... I had a doctor's appointment near there.
[Message 48] CHLOE: A doctor's appointment? Why didn't you say so?
[Message 49] LIAM: Didn't think it was relevant.
[Message 50] MIA: What kind of appointment?
[Message 51] LIAM: Just a check-up. Nothing major.
[Message 52] JAKE: What checkup needs you at the airport?
[Message 53] LIAM: It was a specialist, okay? Can we drop this?
[Message 54] CHLOE: Sure, Liam. Whatever you say.
[Message 55] MIA: Chloe, seriously, stop.
[Message 56] CHLOE: I'm just saying... it's a lot of coincidences.
[Message 57] JAKE: Daniel knew something. About the airport expansion plans, I heard.
[Message 58] MIA: The ones Thompson's been pushing?
[Message 59] JAKE: Maybe.
[Message 60] CHLOE: Thompson wanted to get rid of Daniel, that's obvious.
[Message 61] LIAM: This is insane. You're accusing everyone.
[Message 62] MIA: Liam's right. Chloe, you're going too far.
[Message 63] CHLOE: Fine, fine. I'm done.
[Message 64] JAKE: It's all messed up. Poor guy. Hope they catch whoever did it. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 65] MIA: Me too. Justice for Daniel.
[Message 66] LIAM: Agreed. Justice for Daniel.
[Message 67] CHLOE: Yeah, justice.
[Message 68] MIA: Ugh, I have so much work to do. Thompson's gonna kill me.
[Message 69] CHLOE: Remember Friday, drinks?
[Message 70] MIA: Yes! Need it more than ever now.
[Message 71] LIAM: Guys, I’m out. Head’s killing me.
[Message 72] CHLOE: Feel better, Liam.
[Message 73] MIA: Yeah, hope you feel better.
[Message 74] JAKE: Take it easy, Liam.
[Message 75] CHLOE: So, Mia... Jake seems to know a lot, right? Especially about Daniel and Thompson.
[Message 76] MIA: He does. But he's always been a gossip.
[Message 77] CHLOE: Maybe. Or maybe he was involved somehow. He's the one who failed to call 911 after the victim was hurt, making the harm worse.
[Message 78] MIA: He was at the scene?
[Message 79] CHLOE: Just a hunch.
[Message 80] MIA: You're exhausting, you know that?
[Message 81] CHLOE: But am I wrong?
[Message 82] MIA: I don't know. And frankly, I don't want to know.
[Message 83] CHLOE: Fair enough.
[Message 84] MIA: Thompson was furious with Daniel. Everyone knew that.
[Message 85] CHLOE: Yeah, Thompson is really aware that Daniel wanted to delay the project.
[Message 86] MIA: I should focus on my job. This promotion is a big deal.
[Message 87] CHLOE: You deserve it.
[Message 88] MIA: Thanks. Seriously, let's just drop the murder talk for now.
[Message 89] CHLOE: Okay, okay. Drinks on Friday then? My treat.
[Message 90] MIA: Deal. Can't wait to celebrate!
[Message 91] JAKE: Hey. I deleted my previous messages.
[Message 92] MIA: What are you talking about Jake?
[Message 93] CHLOE: Why Jake?
[Message 94] JAKE: Accident. Wrong chat. Sorry.
[Message 95] MIA: Okay... weird.

[Message 3] Alex: Two people were killed. Brutal.
[Message 4] Ben: Seriously? That's awful.
[Message 5] Casey: I saw it on the news. Crazy.
[Message 6] Alex: Yeah, the news said it was the 5.  Corrections Officer and a social worker.
[Message 7] Ben: A Corrections Officer and a social worker? Weird combo.
[Message 8] Casey: I know, right? Makes you wonder what was going on.
[Message 9] Alex: Police are looking for any leads.
[Message 10] Ben: I hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 11] Casey: Me too. It's scary to think that could happen anywhere.
[Message 12] Alex: So, what are you guys up to tonight?
[Message 13] Ben: Just chilling at home. Watching a movie.
[Message 14] Casey: Same here. Early night for me.
[Message 15] Alex: Cool. I might head to bed early too.
[Message 16] Ben: Good idea. Get some rest.
[Message 17] Casey: Night guys.
[Message 18] Alex: Night.
[Message 19] Ben: Night.
[Message 20] Alex: Did either of you know the victims?
[Message 21] Ben: I don't think so. 5.  Corrections Officer? Social worker? Doesn't ring a bell.
[Message 22] Casey: Nope. Never heard of them.
[Message 23] Alex: Okay, just checking.
[Message 24] Ben: Why, did you?
[Message 25] Alex: I might have seen the 5.  Corrections Officer around once or twice. I go through the bus terminal a lot.
[Message 26] Ben: Oh, okay.
[Message 27] Casey: Makes sense.
[Message 28] Alex: Yeah.
[Message 29] Ben: Still can't believe something like that happened.
[Message 30] Casey: It's unsettling.
[Message 31] Alex: Totally.
[Message 32] Ben: Well, I'm gonna go make some popcorn.
[Message 33] Casey: Enjoy!
[Message 34] Alex: Have a good movie.
[Message 35] Ben: Thanks!
[Message 36] Casey: Anyone else think the bus terminal is kinda creepy at night?
[Message 37] Alex: Yeah, definitely. Especially now.
[Message 38] Ben: Probably always been a little sketchy.
[Message 39] Casey: True.
[Message 40] Alex: Have you guys seen any strange activity in the past few days?
[Message 41] Ben: Not really. Just the usual weirdos.
[Message 42] Casey: Nothing out of the ordinary for me either.
[Message 43] Alex: Okay.
[Message 44] Ben: Why do you ask?
[Message 45] Alex: Just curious. Figured someone might have seen something that could help the police.
[Message 46] Casey: Good point.
[Message 47] Ben: Maybe we should all be a little more observant.
[Message 48] Casey: Definitely.
[Message 49] Alex: Agreed.

[Message 66] Casey: Later
[Message 67] Alex: I heard the victims were named David (Corrections Officer) and Michael (Social Worker).
[Message 68] Ben: David and Michael, huh? Still doesn't ring a bell.
[Message 69] Casey: Nope.
[Message 70] Alex: Maybe someone who used the bus terminal regularly would recognize them.
[Message 71] Ben: Possibly.
[Message 72] Casey: Yeah, maybe.
[Message 73] Alex: The news said Michael was really ambitious.
[Message 74] Ben: Ambitious? How so?
[Message 75] Casey: What do you mean?
[Message 76] Alex: Like, he was trying to climb the corporate ladder fast. Maybe someone was jealous.
[Message 77] Ben: That's a possibility.
[Message 78] Casey: Could be.
[Message 79] Alex: And David, they said he was pretty carefree.
[Message 80] Ben: Carefree? Could have made enemies easily.
[Message 81] Casey: Maybe stepped on some toes.
[Message 82] Alex: Exactly.
[Message 83] Ben: I wonder if they knew each other.
[Message 84] Casey: Good question.
[Message 85] Alex: The police must be looking into that.

[Message 93] Casey: Night.
[Message 94] Ben: Anyone know what Electrocution costs these days?
[Message 95] Alex: Why do you ask, Ben?
[Message 96] Casey: Yeah, that's a random question.
[Message 97] Ben: Just curious. Need to fix something at home.
[Message 98] Alex: Oh, okay. I think it depends on the type.
[Message 99] Casey: Yeah, and where you buy it.
[Message 100] Ben: True.
[Message 101] Alex: I'm still thinking about David. A Corrections Officer.
[Message 102] Ben: Yeah, it's a tough job.
[Message 103] Casey: He probably dealt with some rough people.
[Message 104] Alex: He could have crossed the wrong person.
[Message 105] Ben: Definitely a possibility.
[Message 106] Casey: Makes you wonder if it was work-related.
[Message 107] Alex: That's what I was thinking.
[Message 108] Ben: The police will figure it out.
[Message 109] Casey: Hopefully soon.
[Message 110] Alex: I just hope they didn’t suffer.
[Message 111] Ben: Me too.
[Message 112] Casey: Absolutely.
[Message 113] Alex: What are you guys doing tomorrow?
[Message 114] Ben: Just running some errands.
[Message 115] Casey: I have a doctor's appointment.

[Message 123] Ben: Later.
[Message 124] Casey: Later.
[Message 125] Ben: I heard a rumor that David had it out for someone at work. 
[Message 126] Alex: Oh really? Who?
[Message 127] Casey: Spill the tea.
[Message 128] Ben: Something about a disagreement over work policy, escalating into threats.
[Message 129] Alex: Wow. That could be it.
[Message 130] Casey: Definitely sounds like a motive.
[Message 131] Alex: The police should look into that immediately.
[Message 132] Ben: They probably are.
[Message 133] Casey: You'd hope so.
[Message 134] Alex: This is getting more twisted by the minute.
[Message 135] Ben: Tell me about it.
[Message 136] Casey: Crazy.
[Message 137] Alex: I'm going to read a book and try to relax.
[Message 138] Ben: Good idea.
[Message 139] Casey: Enjoy.
[Message 140] Alex: Thanks.
[Message 141] Ben: Later.
[Message 142] Casey: Night.
[Message 143] Alex: Night.
[Message 144] Ben: Night.
[Message 145] Casey: I saw Ben leave the building at Dead of Night.
[Message 146] Alex: Really? You saw Ben at the bus terminal?
[Message 147] Ben: What the hell are you talking about, Casey? I was at home all night.
[Message 148] Casey: I'm just saying what I saw.
[Message 149] Alex: Casey, are you sure it was Ben?
[Message 150] Ben: This is insane. Why would I be there?
[Message 151] Casey: It was dark, but I'm pretty sure it was you.
[Message 152] Alex: Ben, were you anywhere near the bus terminal last night?
[Message 153] Ben: No! I swear, I was at home watching a movie. Ask my neighbor.
[Message 154] Casey: Maybe I’m mistaken. It was dark out.
[Message 155] Alex: This is getting weird.
[Message 156] Ben: You think?! I'm being accused of murder!
[Message 157] Casey: I didn't say you were the murderer.
[Message 158] Alex: Okay, everyone calm down.
[Message 159] Ben: I'm perfectly calm. I just don't appreciate being falsely accused.
[Message 160] Casey: Like I said, maybe I’m mistaken.
[Message 161] Alex: Maybe it's best if we don't speculate anymore.
[Message 162] Ben: Agreed.
[Message 163] Casey: Whatever.
[Message 164] Alex: The police will figure it out.
[Message 165] Ben: Let's hope so. Before I get framed.
[Message 166] Casey: Just trying to help.
[Message 167] Alex: I know, Casey. Thanks.
[Message 168] Ben: Right. Thanks.
[Message 169] Casey: No problem.
[Message 170] Alex: I'm going to bed. This is too much.
[Message 171] Ben: Me too.
[Message 172] Casey: Goodnight.
[Message 173] Alex: Night.
[Message 174] Ben: Night.
[Message 175] Casey: Night.
[Message 176] Ben: Alex, did you ever find out anything more about Michael?
[Message 177] Alex: Not really. Just that he was ambitious and some people might not have liked that. Why?
[Message 178] Ben: No reason. Just curious.
[Message 179] Casey: Still trying to solve the case, Ben?
[Message 180] Ben: Just making conversation, Casey.
[Message 181] Alex: Guys, let's just drop it, okay?
[Message 182] Ben: Fine by me.
[Message 183] Casey: Whatever you say, Alex.
[Message 184] Alex: Thanks.
[Message 185] Ben: So, anyone watching anything good on TV tonight?
[Message 186] Casey: Not really. Just catching up on the news.
[Message 187] Alex: Same here.
[Message 188] Ben: Maybe I'll find something on streaming.
[Message 189] Casey: Worth a shot.
[Message 190] Alex: Good luck.
[Message 191] Ben: Thanks.
[Message 192] Casey: Later.
[Message 193] Alex: Later.
[Message 194] Ben: Later.
[Message 195] Alex: Hope they find the guy and they're going away for a long time for this.

...","[Message 1] CHLOE: Heard about what happened at the Swimming Pool? So messed up.

[Message 2] MARK: Yeah, crazy. Two 8.  Judge dead. What the hell is going on?

[Message 3] ANNA: I know, right? Both were horrible incident. Poor Judges, rest in peace.

[Message 4] DAVID: Anna, you worked at the court, didn’t you? Did you know them?

[Message 5] ANNA: Yeah, I did. Knew Judges. This is awful.

[Message 6] CHLOE: I feel bad for the families. This is a tragedy.

[Message 7] MARK: Did they catch anyone yet?

[Message 8] DAVID: Not that I’ve heard. Police are being tight-lipped.

[Message 9] CHLOE: I was actually at the Swimming Pool yesterday afternoon. So scary to think about now.

[Message 10] ANNA: Seriously, Chloe? You were there?

[Message 11] CHLOE: Yeah, just grabbing some sun. Left around 5 PM.

[Message 12] DAVID: Early Evening, huh? Close to when it happened.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Don’t even, David. I had nothing to do with it.

[Message 14] DAVID: Just saying, it's bad timing for you.

[Message 15] ANNA: David, stop it. Chloe is a friend.

[Message 16] MARK: Relax, guys. Let the police do their job.

[Message 17] JAKE: Heard they found an Stabbing with an ice pick at the scene. Brutal.

[Message 18] ANNA: Stabbing with an ice pick? That's insane.

[Message 19] CHLOE: Where did you hear that, Jake?

[Message 20] JAKE: Just rumors, Chloe. Around.

[Message 21] DAVID: You always have the inside scoop, Jake.

[Message 22] JAKE: I just listen, David.

[Message 23] MARK: Anyone know the Judges?

[Message 24] ANNA: I worked with them, remember? One of them, Jessica, the woman, she was…intense. A bit Cynical.

[Message 25] CHLOE: I saw Jessica the manager arguing with someone near the pool last week. Sounded heated.

[Message 26] DAVID: Who was she arguing with, Chloe?

[Message 27] CHLOE: Couldn’t tell. Back was to me.

[Message 28] JAKE: Maybe that’s our guy. Someone she pissed off.

[Message 29] ANNA: Jessica could be difficult. But to kill her?

[Message 30] MARK: People do crazy things, Anna.

[Message 31] DAVID: Mark's right. Especially when money is involved.

[Message 32] CHLOE: Money? What money?

[Message 33] DAVID: Just saying, 8.  Judges often have estates and stuff.

[Message 34] ANNA: One of the Judges, let's call her Alexis, was always so Anxious. I wonder if she had enemies.

[Message 35] JAKE: Maybe Alexis knew something she shouldn't have.

[Message 36] CHLOE: You guys are spiraling.

[Message 37] MARK: We're just trying to make sense of it, Chloe.

[Message 38] DAVID: Yeah, Chloe. Why are you so defensive?

[Message 39] CHLOE: I’m not! This is just… a lot.

[Message 40] ANNA: Guys, let's not turn on each other. We're all upset.

[Message 41] JAKE: Agreed. It's messed up.

[Message 42] MARK: I heard Jessica the manager was about to make a big decision on a case. Political, maybe?

[Message 43] CHLOE: You think it was a political assassination?

[Message 44] MARK: Could be. Someone wanting to silence her.

[Message 45] DAVID: That would make sense, actually. The political motive is a good theory.

[Message 46] ANNA: I guess it is possible, I just thought of it as a regular homicide.

[Message 47] JAKE: If it's political, they're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 48] CHLOE: Hope they don't get the death penalty, I couldn't live with that.

[Message 49] MARK: Anyone seen Liam around?

[Message 50] ANNA: Liam? Why Liam?

[Message 51] MARK: Just haven't heard from him. He knew the Judges.

[Message 52] DAVID: Liam is always off the grid. Don't worry about it.

[Message 53] CHLOE: Yeah, Liam’s fine. Probably just busy.

[Message 54] JAKE: Liam always hated 8.  Judge, but I don't think he's capable of this.

[Message 55] ANNA: I agree. He's more talk than action.

[Message 56] MARK: True. But still.

[Message 57] DAVID: Let's focus on facts, not speculation.

[Message 58] CHLOE: Good idea, David.

[Message 59] ANNA: What facts do we have? Two dead 8.  Judges, Stabbing with an ice pick. Swimming Pool. Early Evening.

[Message 60] JAKE: And a lot of rumors.

[Message 61] MARK: And someone with a motive. Political or financial.

[Message 62] DAVID: Or both.

[Message 63] CHLOE: Let’s not forget, someone probably saw something. A witness.

[Message 64] ANNA: Hopefully, they'll come forward.

[Message 65] JAKE: You guys watching the game tonight? Distract ourselves from all this doom and gloom.

[Message 66] CHLOE: Maybe. Depends on my mood.

[Message 67] MARK: I'm in. Need a break.

[Message 68] DAVID: Me too.

[Message 69] ANNA: I'll pass. Still processing.

[Message 70] JAKE: Fair enough.

[Message 71] CHLOE: Anyone know if the Swimming Pool is closed? Was planning on going swimming tomorrow.

[Message 72] MARK: Probably closed for investigation, Chloe.

[Message 73] DAVID: Seriously? That’s your concern right now?

[Message 74] CHLOE: What? I’m just asking a question. I wasn’t even at the Swimming Pool when the murder happened.

[Message 75] ANNA: David, give her a break. It was a genuine question.

[Message 76] JAKE: Everyone just needs to chill. Too much tension here.

[Message 77] MARK: Agreed.

[Message 78] DAVID: Fine. But Chloe, be more sensitive, okay?

[Message 79] CHLOE: Okay. Sorry, everyone.

[Message 80] ANNA: It's alright, Chloe. We all say things we don't mean when we're stressed.

[Message 81] JAKE: Anyone got any snacks for the game later?

[Message 82] CHLOE: I can bring some chips.

[Message 83] MARK: I'll handle the drinks.

[Message 84] DAVID: I'll grab some pizza.

[Message 85] ANNA: Sounds like a plan, guys. Have fun.

[Message 86] JAKE: Will do.

[Message 87] CHLOE: Back to the murder… did anyone notice anything strange leading up to it?

[Message 88] MARK: Besides two dead 8.  Judges?

[Message 89] DAVID: Chloe's trying, Mark. Lay off.

[Message 90] ANNA: I did notice Jessica getting a lot of weird calls lately. She seemed stressed.

[Message 91] JAKE: Weird calls? Anything specific?

[Message 92] ANNA: No idea. She'd just say ""I can't talk now"" and hang up.

[Message 93] CHLOE: Maybe the calls were related to the political thing?

[Message 94] MARK: Could be. Someone trying to intimidate her.

[Message 95] DAVID: Intimidation that escalated.

[Message 96] ANNA: The other Judge, Alexis, seemed to know something, too. Like she was hiding something.

[Message 97] JAKE: Hiding something? What makes you say that?

[Message 98] ANNA: Just a feeling. She was acting strange the past few weeks.

[Message 99] CHLOE: Maybe they were both involved in something shady.

[Message 100] MARK: And someone wanted them silenced.

[Message 101] DAVID: It all adds up, doesn't it?

[Message 102] ANNA: It's terrifying to think about.

[Message 103] JAKE: Speaking of silenced... I heard Liam had a really bad argument with Alexis the 8.  Judge a week before the murder.

[Message 104] CHLOE: See? Liam!

[Message 105] MARK: What was the argument about, Jake?

[Message 106] DAVID: Yeah, details!

[Message 107] JAKE: I overheard them at a bar. Something about money and a deal gone wrong.

[Message 108] ANNA: Money? See, I knew Alexis was up to something.

[Message 109] CHLOE: Liam was looking up how to make Stabbing with an ice pick online. I saw him.

[Message 110] MARK: Chloe, what? Why didn’t you say something earlier?

[Message 111] DAVID: Chloe, you need to tell the police.

[Message 112] ANNA: This is huge!

[Message 113] JAKE: Damn, Chloe. You were holding out on us.

[Message 114] CHLOE: I was scared! And I didn't want to jump to conclusions.

[Message 115] MARK: Well, now you have. Call the cops.

[Message 116] DAVID: Now, Chloe!

[Message 117] ANNA: The concurrence of the event, the weapon and the suspect are all falling in place.

[Message 118] JAKE: Well, I guess we solved the case.

[Message 119] CHLOE: I'm calling them now.

[Message 120] MARK: Good. This needs to be over.

[Message 121] DAVID: Finally, some justice.

[Message 122] ANNA: I still can't believe it.

[Message 123] JAKE: It's crazy, Anna. Crazy world.

[Message 124] CHLOE: The police are on their way to Liam’s place.

[Message 125] MARK: Good. Let's hope they find something.

[Message 126] DAVID: I’m sure they will.

[Message 127] ANNA: I wonder what Alexis knew that got her killed.

[Message 128] JAKE: Maybe we'll never know.

[Message 129] CHLOE: Hopefully, this brings some closure to everyone.

[Message 130] MARK: Yeah, closure is needed.

[Message 131] DAVID: Agreed.

[Message 132] ANNA: I’m glad we could all talk about this. It helped.

[Message 133] JAKE: Me too.

[Message 134] CHLOE: We're all in this together.

[Message 135] MARK: Always.

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, Chloe, I'm still processing it. It's crazy.

[Message 3] Chloe: I know, right? Poor Sarah. Such a shock.

[Message 4] Liam: Seriously. Did you know her well?

[Message 5] Chloe: Not *well* well, but we chatted sometimes. She seemed nice. You?

[Message 6] Liam: Same. Used the same equipment. Small talk.

[Message 7] Chloe: The news said something about Poisoning via inhalation. How awful.

[Message 8] Liam: Yeah, brutal. I heard they found something suspicious nearby.

[Message 9] Chloe: Ugh, this whole thing gives me the creeps. I hope they catch whoever did this.

[Message 10] Liam: Me too. Justice for Sarah.

[Message 11] Chloe: Amen to that. So, how's work been? Anything exciting?

[Message 12] Liam: Same old, same old. Paperwork, deadlines... the usual grind.

[Message 13] Chloe: Tell me about it. I'm drowning in emails.

[Message 14] Liam: You going to the vigil tonight?

[Message 15] Chloe: I was thinking about it. Are you?

[Message 16] Liam: Probably. Seems like the right thing to do.

[Message 17] Chloe: Agreed. It will be good to show respect.

[Message 18] Liam: Yeah. Maybe we can meet up there?

[Message 19] Chloe: Sure, Liam. I will be there around 7 pm.

[Message 20] Liam: Sounds good. See you then.

[Message 21] Chloe: Great. Later!

[Message 22] Maya: Hey Chloe, you heard anything new about Sarah?

[Message 23] Chloe: Just what's on the news, Maya. Why?

[Message 24] Maya: Just wondering. I saw her arguing with someone a few days ago.

[Message 25] Chloe: Really? Who?

[Message 26] Maya: I didn't get a good look. Just a woman... kinda soft spoken.

[Message 27] Chloe: Hmm, interesting. Did they seem really angry?

[Message 28] Maya: Yeah, pretty heated. I almost stepped in.

[Message 29] Chloe: You should tell the police, Maya. That could be important.

[Message 30] Maya: I will, I just wanted to see if you knew anything first.

[Message 31] Chloe: Nope, nothing like that. Thanks for the info, though.

[Message 32] Maya: No problem. This whole thing is just awful.

[Message 33] Chloe: I know. Hey, you still got that book I lent you?

[Message 34] Maya: Oh shoot, almost forgot! I'll bring it tomorrow.

[Message 35] Chloe: No worries. Just remind me.

[Message 36] Maya: Will do. Talk soon.

[Message 37] Chloe: Bye!

[Message 38] Liam: Hey Chloe, something's bothering me.

[Message 39] Chloe: What's up, Liam?

[Message 40] Liam: I saw Bethany at the gym that night.

[Message 41] Chloe: Bethany? You mean Sarah's sister?

[Message 42] Liam: Yeah. She looked really upset.

[Message 43] Chloe: Did you talk to her?

[Message 44] Liam: Briefly. She said she was ""taking care of something.""

[Message 45] Chloe: Taking care of what? That sounds weird.

[Message 46] Liam: I don't know! That's why it's bothering me.

[Message 47] Chloe: Definitely tell the police, Liam. Don't hold back.

[Message 48] Liam: I know, I know. I just... I don't want to make things worse.

[Message 49] Chloe: Worse how? Look, Sarah's gone. We need to do what's right.

[Message 50] Liam: You're right. I'll call them tomorrow.

[Message 51] Chloe: Good. And hey, maybe she was just upset about something else.

[Message 52] Liam: Maybe. But I keep thinking about it.

[Message 53] Chloe: Just do the right thing, Liam. Okay?

[Message 54] Liam: Okay. Thanks, Chloe. You always know what to say.

[Message 55] Chloe: Anytime. Now, stop worrying and get some sleep.

[Message 56] Liam: Easier said than done. Talk to you later.

[Message 57] Chloe: Night, Liam.

[Message 58] Bethany: Chloe, can I ask you something?

[Message 59] Chloe: Sure, Bethany. What's on your mind?

[Message 60] Bethany: Did Sarah ever mention anything about... problems at work?

[Message 61] Chloe: Problems? Not really. Why do you ask?

[Message 62] Bethany: I heard she was having issues with a coworker.

[Message 63] Chloe: Hmm, I don't recall. She mostly talked about her fitness goals.

[Message 64] Bethany: Right. Well, thanks anyway.

[Message 65] Chloe: Is everything alright, Bethany? You seem stressed.

[Message 66] Bethany: I'm just... grieving. It's hard, you know?

[Message 67] Chloe: I can imagine. I am so sorry for your loss.

[Message 68] Bethany: Thanks, Chloe. It means a lot. I was going to go to the store to buy Poisoning via inhalation but someone was already there.

[Message 69] Chloe: Have you heard anything from the police?

[Message 70] Bethany: They just asked me a few questions. Nothing major.

[Message 71] Chloe: Oh. Okay.

[Message 72] Bethany: Yeah. Listen, I gotta go.

[Message 73] Chloe: Alright. Take care, Bethany.

[Message 74] Bethany: You too.

[Message 75] Chloe: Liam, you spoke to the police yet?

[Message 76] Liam: Yeah, Chloe. I told them about Bethany.

[Message 77] Chloe: Good. Did they seem interested?

[Message 78] Liam: They asked a lot of questions about her demeanor.

[Message 79] Chloe: Did you mention she said she was ""taking care of something?""

[Message 80] Liam: Yep, everything. I feel a little guilty, though.

[Message 81] Chloe: Why? You did the right thing.

[Message 82] Liam: I know, but what if I'm wrong about her?

[Message 83] Chloe: They'll investigate. They'll figure it out.

[Message 84] Liam: I hope so. This whole thing is messed up.

[Message 85] Chloe: Tell me about it. So, anything exciting happening with you?

[Message 86] Liam: Not really. Just trying to stay busy.

[Message 87] Chloe: Distraction is good. Movie night this weekend?

[Message 88] Liam: Sounds good. What do you want to watch?

[Message 89] Chloe: I'm open to suggestions. Something light.

[Message 90] Liam: Okay, I'll look some up. Thanks, Chloe. You're a good friend.

[Message 91] Chloe: Always here for you, Liam.

[Message 92] Liam: I appreciate that. Talk soon.

[Message 93] Chloe: Bye!

[Message 94] Maya: Hey Chloe, you won't believe this.

[Message 95] Chloe: What is it, Maya?

[Message 96] Maya: I saw Bethany arguing with Sarah last week and heard her say to Sarah she intended to make her life hell because of a promotion that Sarah had gotten.

[Message 97] Chloe: What?! Why didn't you say something sooner?

[Message 98] Maya: I didn't think it was that big of a deal!

[Message 99] Chloe: Maya, this is huge! You need to tell the police NOW.

[Message 100] Maya: Okay, okay. I will.

[Message 101] Chloe: Seriously, Maya. This could be the key.

[Message 102] Maya: I know, I know. I'm going now.

[Message 103] Chloe: Good. Let me know what happens.

[Message 104] Maya: Will do. Wish me luck.

[Message 105] Chloe: You got this.

[Message 106] Chloe: Liam, any updates?

[Message 107] Liam: Not really. Still waiting to hear back from the police.

[Message 108] Chloe: Did they say anything about Bethany?

[Message 109] Liam: Just that they're looking into it. Nothing concrete.

[Message 110] Chloe: Hmm. This is taking too long.

[Message 111] Liam: I know. It's frustrating.

[Message 112] Chloe: Maybe they're looking at other suspects too.

[Message 113] Liam: Maybe. I just want this to be over.

[Message 114] Chloe: Me too. Hey, how about pizza tonight?

[Message 115] Liam: That sounds good. Thanks, Chloe.

[Message 116] Chloe: My treat. We all need it.

[Message 117] Liam: Awesome. I'll be there around 7.

[Message 118] Chloe: See you then.

[Message 119] Bethany: Chloe, I need to talk to you.

[Message 120] Chloe: What is it, Bethany? You sound upset.

[Message 121] Bethany: The police questioned me again.

[Message 122] Chloe: About what?

[Message 123] Bethany: About Sarah and me. About... everything. I know Maya mentioned something, but my shouting at Sarah probably provoked her.

[Message 124] Chloe: Did you tell them everything?

[Message 125] Bethany: Yes! I swear, I didn't do anything.

[Message 126] Chloe: I believe you, Bethany. Just stay calm.

[Message 127] Bethany: It's just... they keep asking about that argument.

[Message 128] Chloe: Just tell them the truth.

[Message 129] Bethany: I am! But they don't believe me.

[Message 130] Chloe: They will. It'll all work out.

[Message 131] Bethany: I hope so, Chloe. I really do. Hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 132] Chloe: They won't. Just trust the process.

[Message 133] Bethany: Okay. Thanks, Chloe.

[Message 134] Chloe: Anytime, Bethany.

[Message 135] Liam: Chloe, they arrested Bethany!

[Message 136] Chloe: What?! Are you serious?

[Message 137] Liam: Yeah! It's all over the news. They found evidence.

[Message 138] Chloe: What kind of evidence?

[Message 139] Liam: I don't know, but it's enough to charge her.

[Message 140] Chloe: Wow. I... I don't know what to say.

[Message 8] MAYA: Car accident, Liam. Tragic.

[Message 9] KIRA: I think I saw something! Yesterday, Mid-Morning, I was getting coffee near there. Saw someone speeding away... kinda bushy eyebrows if I remember right?

[Message 10] JASPER: Kira, you always see stuff. LOL

[Message 11] KIRA: Shut up, Jasper! It's true! I think it was a dark SUV.

[Message 12] LIAM: A dark SUV, huh? That's… specific.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Maybe you should tell the police, Kira.

[Message 14] KIRA: I might. Just trying to remember details. Was pretty chaotic.

[Message 15] MAYA: Speaking of chaotic, anyone wanna grab pizza later?

[Message 16] LIAM: Pizza sounds good. I’m in.

[Message 17] JASPER: Me too.

[Message 18] CHLOE: Can't, got a late shift.

[Message 19] LIAM: Dang, Chloe. Well, let's catch a game soon!

[Message 20] KIRA: Guys, back to David Miller. It just doesn't feel like an accident...

[Message 21] MAYA: Kira, don't go all conspiracy theorist on us.

[Message 22] JASPER: Yeah, chill Kira.

[Message 23] KIRA: I'm just saying! He was making noise. I saw him leave the building at Mid-Morning.

[Message 24] LIAM: Making noise how? Protests?

[Message 25] KIRA: Yeah, stuff like that. Some people didn’t like it.

[Message 26] MAYA: Who cares what people think. Someone got in an accident.

[Message 27] JASPER: Chill Maya

[Message 28] KIRA: I thought I saw Axel around there that day too.

[Message 29] LIAM: Axel? You sure?

[Message 30] KIRA: Pretty sure. Maybe earlier in the morning.

[Message 31] MAYA: Why do you even care?

[Message 32] KIRA: Because Axel always hated activists.

[Message 33] JASPER: Axel is harmless.

[Message 34] LIAM: Hold up. I heard Dana used to be a witness.

[Message 35] KIRA: What did Dana witness?

[Message 36] MAYA: Witness to what?

[Message 37] JASPER: What's that gotta do with anything?

[Message 38] LIAM: Something shady. Maybe she wanted to get rid of him because he knew something.

[Message 39] KIRA: Wait, is Dana the one with the lip piercing?

[Message 40] MAYA: Yeah. Why?

[Message 41] KIRA: No reason, just thinking.

[Message 42] JASPER: Okay this is all crazy. Let's just drop it.

[Message 43] CHLOE: I agree with Jasper.

[Message 44] LIAM: I just heard Dana and Axel were both seen near the airport.

[Message 45] KIRA: They are both suspects. They’re going away for a long time for this.

[Message 46] MAYA: Seen by who? This is all hearsay!

[Message 47] JASPER: Yeah, Liam, where'd you hear that?

[Message 48] LIAM: A friend who works at the airport.

[Message 49] KIRA: Did the friend see if Axel and Dana where together?

[Message 50] LIAM: They didn’t specify.

[Message 51] MAYA: It's a big airport. People are there all the time.

[Message 52] JASPER: My head hurts. Pizza time.

[Message 53] CHLOE: Agree. Let’s just watch a movie and chill.

[Message 54] KIRA: Fine. But I'm not dropping this completely.

[Message 55] LIAM: Same here.

[Message 56] MAYA: Whatever, guys.

[Message 57] JASPER: Movie night at my place?

[Message 58] CHLOE: Be there in 30.

[Message 59] LIAM: Cool, see ya soon.

[Message 60] KIRA: I might be late. Still gotta check on something…

[Message 61] MAYA: What is wrong with you?

[Message 62] JASPER: Kira, seriously.

[Message 63] KIRA: Just a feeling, okay? Don't wait up.

[Message 64] CHLOE: Ok whatever.

[Message 65] LIAM: Something’s fishy with this whole situation, right? I can't put my finger on it.

[Message 66] CHLOE: Yeah. Me neither.

[Message 67] MAYA: Can we just have fun.

[Message 68] JASPER: Foreal Maya.

[Message 69] LIAM: Sorry guys. I’m just a little shook.

[Message 70] CHLOE: It’s okay. We all are.

[Message 71] JASPER: We cool.

[Message 72] KIRA: Hey, did David Miller have any enemies?

[Message 73] LIAM: I think he was political

[Message 74] CHLOE: He’s an activist so probably.

[Message 75] MAYA: Who cares. Why does it matter.

[Message 76] KIRA: It all matters! I told the police about what I saw, and Axel.

[Message 77] LIAM: Good job Kira.

[Message 78] CHLOE: Nice Kira

[Message 79] MAYA: Whatever, guys.

[Message 80] JASPER: I'm getting pizza now guys.

[Message 117] MAYA: ""So, Raj, how's that new client you were telling me about?""
[Message 118] RAJ: ""He's a pain in the ass. Always changing his mind.""
[Message 119] CHLOE: ""Sounds stressful.""
[Message 120] MAYA: ""Tell me about it. I had a client like that last year. Drove me crazy.""

[Message 149] CHLOE: ""Hey, Liam just texted me. He said he saw Victor near the Car Wash last night around Evening.""
[Message 150] MAYA: ""Seriously? That's two people spotted near the scene.""
[Message 151] RAJ: ""Things are getting interesting! He was talking about hurting David right before he went over there, probably.""
[Message 152] CHLOE: ""He should tell the police. This could be big.""
[Message 153] MAYA: ""Absolutely. Every detail matters.""
[Message 154] RAJ: ""Maybe Liam knows more than he's letting on.""
[Message 155] CHLOE: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 156] MAYA: ""Don't start with the accusations again, Raj.""
[Message 157] RAJ: ""I'm just saying! He's suspiciously helpful with the information, isn't it weird?""
[Message 158] CHLOE: ""Maybe he's just trying to help.""
[Message 159] MAYA: ""Exactly. Let's not jump to conclusions.""
[Message 160] RAJ: ""Whatever. I still think something's up.""
[Message 161] CHLOE: ""Hey, have either of you heard from Liam since he sent that text?""
[Message 162] MAYA: ""No, not since then. Why?""
[Message 163] CHLOE: ""I tried calling him, but it went straight to voicemail. Just seems a bit odd.""
[Message 164] MAYA: ""Maybe his phone died?""
[Message 165] RAJ: ""Or maybe he's busy... disposing of evidence.""
[Message 166] CHLOE: ""RAJ! Stop it! This isn't a game.""
[Message 167] MAYA: ""Seriously, Raj, your comments are getting out of line. He was buying Stabbing with a knife at the store and was there too!""
[Message 168] RAJ: ""Fine, fine. I'm just saying, everyone is a suspect until proven innocent.""
[Message 169] CHLOE: ""Well, maybe you should start applying that logic to yourself, Raj.""
[Message 170] MAYA: ""Yeah, Raj. Let's just wait for the police to do their job. We don't need to make things harder.""

[Message 13] DEVIN: ""I don't wanna get involved, Chloe! What if I'm wrong?""
[Message 14] CHLOE: ""Better safe than sorry, Devin. Think about Alex.""
[Message 15] DEVIN: ""Ugh, fine. I'll think about it.""
[Message 16] LIAM: ""Hey, you guys hear anything new?""
[Message 17] CHLOE: ""Devin says Sarah was acting weird.""
[Message 18] LIAM: ""Sarah? Weird how?""
[Message 19] DEVIN: ""Just...off. You know how she gets when she's stressed. Also she said she wanted to get rid of Alex.""
[Message 20] LIAM: ""Hm. I saw Sarah leave the building at Midnight.""
[Message 21] CHLOE: ""Midnight?! Liam, that's huge! Tell the police!""
[Message 22] LIAM: ""I already did, Chloe. Relax.""
[Message 23] DEVIN: ""Okay, good. Someone had to.""
[Message 24] SARAH: ""Why are you guys talking about me?""
[Message 25] CHLOE: ""Sarah! Where have you been?""
[Message 26] SARAH: ""Out. Why? Am I not allowed to leave my house now?""
[Message 27] DEVIN: ""Just...you've been acting strange, that's all.""
[Message 28] SARAH: ""Strange how, Devin? Enlighten me.""
[Message 29] LIAM: ""He just meant you seemed stressed, Sarah. It's been a rough week for everyone.""
[Message 30] SARAH: ""Easy for you to say, Liam. You didn't lose your job because of Alex. If he hadn't fired me, none of this would have happened.""
[Message 31] CHLOE: ""Wait, Alex fired you? When?""
[Message 32] SARAH: ""Last week! Said I was underperforming. Bullshit. He always hated me.""
[Message 33] DEVIN: ""Whoa, okay. That's...motive, Sarah.""
[Message 34] SARAH: ""Motive for what, Devin? To be annoyed? Yeah. To do anything else? Absolutely not.""
[Message 35] LIAM: ""Just cooperate with the police, Sarah. It'll look better.""
[Message 36] SARAH: ""I am cooperating! I told them everything!""
[Message 37] CHLOE: ""Everything, everything? About wanting to 'get rid' of Alex?""
[Message 38] SARAH: ""I meant get rid of the stress! Get over it! Ugh, I need a drink.""
[Message 39] DEVIN: ""Maybe not the best time to be seen out drinking, Sarah.""
[Message 40] SARAH: ""Mind your own business, Devin.""
[Message 41] LIAM: ""Guys, can we all just calm down? This isn't helping anyone.""
[Message 42] CHLOE: ""Liam's right. Let's just... wait for the police to figure it out.""
[Message 43] DEVIN: ""Fine. But I'm still worried about Sarah.""
[Message 44] SARAH: ""Worried about me? Please. I'm fine. Just royally pissed off.""
[Message 45] CHLOE: ""Anyone hear from Kai?""
[Message 46] LIAM: ""Nope. Why?""
[Message 47] CHLOE: ""Just haven't seen them around. Thought they might know something.""
[Message 48] DEVIN: ""Kai was always weird. They had that whole 'mercy killing' thing going on.""
[Message 49] SARAH: ""Oh god, don't even start with that Kai nonsense. They're harmless.""
[Message 50] LIAM: ""Unless they thought Alex was suffering, maybe?""
[Message 51] CHLOE: ""Liam! Don't go there.""
[Message 52] LIAM: ""Just saying, it fits their whole philosophy.""
[Message 53] DEVIN: ""I heard Kai was looking up how to make Using a garrote online a few days ago.""
[Message 54] SARAH: ""That's a lie! You're making things up, Devin.""
[Message 55] DEVIN: ""Am not! I saw it on their computer when I was helping them with their taxes.""
[Message 56] LIAM: ""Okay, that's pretty damning.""
[Message 57] CHLOE: ""This is getting out of hand. We need to let the police handle this.""
[Message 58] SARAH: ""Seriously! You guys are going to ruin someone's life with your gossip.""
[Message 59] LIAM: ""Speaking of... anyone know how long they're going away for for this?""
[Message 60] CHLOE: ""Lets drop the topic for now, I'm gonna make a pizza.""
[Message 61] DEVIN: ""Can you add pepperoni?""
[Message 62] CHLOE: ""Of course, what time should I expect you?""
[Message 63] DEVIN: ""I'll be there around 7.""
[Message 64] CHLOE: ""Sounds good! See you then.""
[Message 65] SARAH: ""I think its really harsh that everyone has judged me over this!""
[Message 66] LIAM: ""Im not judging you, I have been trying to clear your name.""
[Message 67] SARAH: ""I guess your right, thanks Liam!""
[Message 68] LIAM: ""No worries, I'm always here for you!""

[Message 74] LIAM: ""I hope they don't get the death penalty, that would be awful!""

[Message 2] Maya: No, sorry Chloe. Hey Liam, you still up for that movie tomorrow?

[Message 3] Liam: Yeah, definitely Maya! What time?

[Message 4] Chloe: Did something happen at University last night? I heard sirens.

[Message 5] Sarah: Yeah, Chloe, it was crazy. Heard it was near the corrections office.

[Message 6] Maya: Just rumors, probably. You know how University is.

[Message 7] Liam: True. Anyone know if Professor Davies is still giving that pop quiz on Friday?

[Message 8] Chloe: Ugh, don't remind me, Liam. I'm so behind.

[Message 9] Sarah: Seriously. Anyone catch the basketball game?

[Message 10] Maya: I did! Anderson High killed it.

[Message 11] Liam: Nice! I was stuck studying.

[Message 12] Chloe: Lucky you. I was working.

[Message 13] Sarah: So, back to the sirens… anyone know anything real?

[Message 14] Maya: Stop being nosy, Sarah. It's probably nothing.

[Message 15] Liam: Yeah, let the police handle it. More worried about that quiz.

[Message 16] Chloe: Fair enough. Anyone want to study together on Thursday?

[Message 17] Sarah: I can. What time, Chloe?

[Message 18] Maya: I'm busy Thursday. Got a thing.

[Message 19] Liam: I'm free. Count me in.

[Message 20] Chloe: Cool, 7pm at the library?

[Message 21] Sarah: Sounds good.

[Message 22] Liam: Perfect.

[Message 23] Maya: Gotta go, guys. Talk later.

[Message 24] Chloe: Bye Maya!

[Message 25] Sarah: See ya.

[Message 26] Liam: Later.

[Message 27] Sarah: So, Liam, what did you do last night?

[Message 28] Liam: Studied, like I said. Why?

[Message 29] Sarah: Just curious. You seemed quick to dismiss the sirens.

[Message 30] Liam: Just don't like gossip. It was probably just a loud party.

[Message 31] Chloe: I still think something bad happened. It was late.

[Message 32] Sarah: Me too.

[Message 33] Liam: Whatever. I'm out.

[Message 34] Chloe: Okay bye.

[Message 35] Sarah: Later, Liam.

[Message 36] Maya: Sarah, can you do me a huge favor?

[Message 37] Sarah: What's up?

[Message 38] Maya: Can you tell Chloe I can't make the study session? Something came up.

[Message 39] Sarah: Sure, but why don't you tell her yourself?

[Message 40] Maya: I'm kinda avoiding her right now. Don't ask.

[Message 41] Sarah: Okay… weird. But fine.

[Message 42] Maya: Thanks, you're the best.

[Message 43] Sarah: No problem.

[Message 44] Chloe: Sarah, did Maya say anything about last night?

[Message 45] Sarah: No, why?

[Message 46] Chloe: Just seemed like she was acting weird.

[Message 47] Sarah: She did ask me to tell you she can't make the study session.

[Message 48] Chloe: See? Weird. Something's definitely up.

[Message 49] Sarah: Maybe she's just stressed about the quiz.

[Message 50] Chloe: Maybe.

[Message 51] Liam: Hey guys, heard a rumor... someone died near the Corrections Office last night.

[Message 52] Chloe: Liam! I knew it!

[Message 53] Sarah: Oh my god…

[Message 54] Maya: Where did you hear that, Liam?

[Message 55] Liam: A friend of a friend. Said it was pretty bad.

[Message 56] Chloe: Oh my god, that's awful.

[Message 57] Sarah: Who was it? Do they know?

[Message 58] Liam: No details. Just that it happened.

[Message 59] Maya: This is getting out of hand. Stop spreading rumors.

[Message 60] Chloe: It's not a rumor if someone DIED, Maya!

[Message 61] Sarah: I agree with Chloe. This is serious.

[Message 62] Liam: Maybe Maya knows something she's not telling us?

[Message 63] Maya: What? That's ridiculous, Liam! I was at home ALL night.

[Message 64] Chloe: Were you really, Maya?

[Message 65] Sarah: Yeah, Maya, where were you?

[Message 66] Maya: I already said! Home! Watching TV. Alone.

[Message 67] Liam: What were you watching?

[Message 68] Maya: None of your business!

[Message 69] Chloe: It kind of is our business now, Maya.

[Message 70] Sarah: Seriously.

[Message 71] Maya: Fine! I was watching some dumb true crime documentary. Happy?

[Message 72] Liam: What true crime documentary?

[Message 73] Maya: I don't know! Some one about stabbing with an ice pick or something! Why does it matter?

[Message 74] Chloe: It matters because someone was stabbed, maybe with stabbing with an ice pick, near the corrections office where 5.  Corrections Officer works!

[Message 75] Sarah: Wow, Maya. That's… a lot.

[Message 76] Maya: It's a coincidence! I watch those all the time.

[Message 77] Liam: I’m done with this, going back to studying.

[Message 78] Chloe: Yeah, me too. This is too heavy.

[Message 79] Sarah: Agreed. Later.

[Message 80] Maya: Whatever. Leave me alone.

[Message 81] Chloe: Sarah, I'm really worried about Maya.

[Message 82] Sarah: Me too. She's acting so guilty.

[Message 83] Chloe: What do we do?

[Message 84] Sarah: I don't know… should we go to the police?

[Message 85] Chloe: I don't want to get her in trouble if she's innocent.

[Message 86] Sarah: True. But what if she's not?

[Message 87] Chloe: Maybe we should try talking to her again first?

[Message 88] Sarah: Okay. But I'm not going alone.

[Message 89] Chloe: Me neither. Let's do it tomorrow?

[Message 90] Sarah: Deal.

[Message 91] Chloe: Hey Maya, can we talk?

[Message 92] Maya: About what? To repeat myself that I am innocent?

[Message 93] Chloe: About what happened last night. About 5.  Corrections Officer.

[Message 94] Maya: I told you, I was at home. What more do you want?

[Message 95] Chloe: We just want to understand.

[Message 96] Maya: There's nothing to understand! Leave me alone! I was watching TV.

[Message 97] Sarah: Did you know 5.  Corrections Officer?

[Message 98] Maya: No! Why would I?

[Message 99] Chloe: You seemed pretty freaked out when Liam mentioned the corrections office.

[Message 100] Maya: I just… I don't like hearing about people dying. It scares me.

[Message 101] Sarah: You should try to protect someone for me.

[Message 102] Chloe: Who were you protecting, Maya?

[Message 103] Maya: No one! I swear! I didn't even know him!

[Message 104] Sarah: You're lying, Maya. We can tell.

[Message 105] Maya: I'm not! Please just believe me!

[Message 106] Chloe: Then tell us the truth.

[Message 107] Maya: I… I can't.

[Message 108] Sarah: That's it. We're going to the police.

[Message 109] Maya: No! Please don't!

[Message 110] Chloe: Tell us what happened, and maybe we can help you.

[Message 111] Maya: Okay, fine! But you have to promise not to tell anyone else.

[Message 112] Sarah: We can't promise that, Maya. But we'll listen.

[Message 113] Maya: Ugh, I hate him. He knows what to do. He knew what he intended to do! 

[Message 114] Chloe: Who Maya! Who are you talking about?

[Message 115] Maya: No one. Forget I said anything.

[Message 116] Sarah: Maya, who is ""he""?

[Message 117] Maya: He, um, he sells me stuff.

[Message 118] Chloe: Sarah, shes deflecting.

[Message 119] Sarah: I know.

[Message 120] Maya: I was with Liam. 

[Message 121] Chloe: You were with Liam last night?

[Message 122] Maya: Yeah, we hung out.

[Message 123] Sarah: Liam said he was studying.

[Message 124] Maya: He lied. He lies all the time.

[Message 125] Chloe: I'm confused.

[Message 126] Sarah: Me too. Liam, where are you?

[Message 127] Liam: I’m here. What's up?

[Message 128] Sarah: Maya says you were with her last night. Is that true?

[Message 129] Liam: Absolutely not. I was studying at the library until late.

[Message 130] Chloe: Maya, why did you lie?

[Message 131] Maya: I... I don't know! I panicked!

[Message 132] Sarah: You're making this worse, Maya.

[Message 133] Liam: She knew. She was aware.

[Message 134] Chloe: What do you mean, Liam?

[Message 135] Liam: Nothing. Forget I said that.

[Message 136] Sarah: No, Liam, tell us!

[Message 137] Liam: I can't. It's too much. I saw him leave the building at Evening.

[Message 138] Chloe: You saw who leave the building, Liam?

[Message 139] Liam: It was 5.  Corrections Officer.

[Message 140] Sarah: 5.  Corrections Officer?

[Message 141] Liam: I saw him walk out.

[Message 142] Chloe: But the person who died *was* 5.  Corrections Officer. So what does that even mean.

[Message 143] Sarah: Liam are you okay. 

[Message 144] Maya: Chloe, tell the truth now?

[Message 145] Chloe: Im trying to process the information. What information are you not telling me?!

[Message 146] Sarah: Stop dodging. What do you know.

[Message 147] Liam: I just saw him leave. I swear.

[Message 148] Chloe: Sarah, lets just got to the cops with this.

[Message 149] Sarah: Yeah, lets go.

[Message 150] Maya: I didn't do anything. I just wanted to get rid of him.

[Message 151] Chloe: You wanted to kill 5.  Corrections Officer?!

[Message 152] Sarah: What the hell, Maya?

[Message 153] Maya: I didn't do it! I just… I wished it.

[Message 154] Liam: I knew it.

[Message 155] Chloe: He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.

[Message 156] Sarah: Hurt who Liam? Chloe?

[Message 157] Liam: I just mean you shouldn't talk bad things about 5.  Corrections Officer!

[Message 158] Chloe: I am at my wits end. You are all being so shady!

[Message 159] Sarah: This is more intense than I thought.

[Message 160] Maya: It's like everyone is trying to hide something. 

[Message 161] Liam: I saw him buy a stabbing with an ice pick at the store!

[Message 162] Chloe: 5.  Corrections Officer bought a stabbing with an ice pick.

[Message 163] Sarah: When Liam? Why stabbing with an ice pick?

[Message 164] Liam: I dont know why stabbing with an ice pick.

[Message 165] Maya: Guys I think we have to go to the police.

[Message 166] Chloe: Agree. But i want to confirm all of this.

[Message 167] Sarah: Who do you trust more, liam or maya?

[Message 168] Chloe: That's hard. They both have motives.

[Message 169] Maya: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened!

[Message 170] Liam: You know what, maybe I am going to go to jail.

[Message 171] Chloe: Oh no. You think your going to go to jail.

[Message 172] Sarah: I hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 173] Maya: I just told you what I know. 

[Message 174] Liam: I did too!

[Message 175] Chloe: Well lets find out.

[Message 176] Sarah: Okay lets go!

[Message 177] Chloe: This has all been too much. 

[Message 178] Liam: Agreed. Never would of thought this would happen.

[Message 179] Sarah: Seriously. 

[Message 180] Maya: Lets just get to the police.

[Message 181] Chloe: Okay. I'm ready when you are.

[Message 182] Sarah: Lets leave right now.

[Message 183] Liam: Should we get a lawyer.

[Message 184] Maya: Guys I think we need to get a lawyer.

[Message 185] Chloe: We absolutely do.

[Message 2] MAYA: OMG, Chloe! No! What? I just got off work.

[Message 3] CHLOE: Double homicide. Early Morning. Two people. It's all over the news.

[Message 4] MAYA: Seriously? That's insane! Who were they?

[Message 5] CHLOE: Some Drug Dealer named Alex and a Social Worker named Jamie. I think.

[Message 6] MAYA: Alex...Jamie... Never heard of them. So awful.

[Message 7] CHLOE: Yeah. Tampa's getting scary. You walking home okay?

[Message 8] MAYA: My neighbor, Ben, picked me up. Thanks, though! He's a lifesaver.

[Message 9] CHLOE: Good. Stay safe. I’m supposed to meet with Ben for drinks this week, I will probably cancel it.

[Message 10] MAYA: You should! I would. It's unsettling. Did they say how they died?

[Message 11] CHLOE: Not exactly. Something about a needle? The news is vague.

[Message 12] MAYA: A needle? That sounds...intentional.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Right? That’s what I thought. Someone really hated them. Ben mentioned he knew Alex, I think.

[Message 14] MAYA: Maybe he knows something? What did he say about Alex?

[Message 15] CHLOE: Just that he “dealt with him” once. Sounded like a business thing. Nothing serious.

[Message 16] MAYA: Oh. Well, that's still... something. Weird.

[Message 17] CHLOE: Right? Anyway, I gotta go. Dinner's ready. Talk later.

[Message 18] MAYA: Sure. Stay safe!

[Message 19] BEN: Hey Maya, just checking in. Chloe seemed really shaken up.

[Message 20] MAYA: Yeah, she told me about Alex and Jamie. It's horrible.

[Message 21] BEN: It is. I can’t believe it. I’ve known Alex for a while… it’s difficult to process.

[Message 22] MAYA: Chloe said you ""dealt with"" Alex once? What was that about?

[Message 23] BEN: Oh, that? It was nothing. Just a minor disagreement over some parking space issue. A long time ago.

[Message 24] MAYA: Oh, okay. Just seems strange now, you know? Given everything.

[Message 25] BEN: Yeah, I get it. Look, can we talk about something else? This is stressing me out.

[Message 26] MAYA: Sure. Sorry. How’s your mom doing?

[Message 27] BEN: She's better, thanks for asking. The doctor said she needs to rest. This Alex situation is really making me feel down, you know? Like, what's the point of all this?

[Message 28] MAYA: Yeah, it’s a lot to take in. You seem more upset than I would expect for just knowing the guy for a while.

[Message 29] BEN: Of course I am upset! I have to take some medicine for my Limp when walking, and she was getting the medicine, this will make it very difficult to get the meds in time. You know, just the general principle is bad. Anyway, I’m gonna watch some TV and try to relax. Talk soon.

[Message 30] MAYA: Okay. Feel better.

[Message 31] CHLOE: Hey! I saw Ben at that pharmacy near Taxi Stand earlier.

[Message 32] MAYA: Really? What was he doing there?

[Message 33] CHLOE: Just picking up a prescription, I guess. He looked really stressed.

[Message 34] MAYA: He mentioned his Limp when walking was acting up. Maybe that's it.

[Message 35] CHLOE: Maybe. He was there really Early Morning. Like, before anything opened.

[Message 36] MAYA: Weird. You think he’s hiding something?

[Message 37] CHLOE: I don’t know. It’s just… everything’s weird now, isn’t it?

[Message 38] MAYA: Tell me about it. This whole thing is just a nightmare.

[Message 39] CHLOE: Hey, do you remember Sarah from the office? She knew Jamie pretty well, I think.

[Message 40] MAYA: Sarah? Yeah, vaguely. Why?

[Message 41] CHLOE: I just remember her saying Jamie was really withdrawn lately, like something was bothering them.

[Message 42] MAYA: Oh. Maybe it was work stress. Social Worker is a tough job.

[Message 43] CHLOE: Could be. Or maybe… something else. What if I want to intended get rid of someone ?

[Message 44] MAYA: Chloe, you’re scaring me. Don’t say things like that.

[Message 45] CHLOE: Sorry. Just thinking out loud. This whole thing is making me paranoid. I saw Ben buying Administering a lethal injection at the store the other day.

[Message 46] MAYA: You what?! Administering a lethal injection? Are you sure?

[Message 47] CHLOE: I'm positive. He said it was for a school project. But now I am unsure, I need to take that back!

[Message 48] MAYA: School project? That is the lamest excuse I’ve ever heard. I don't think he will get the death penalty but is enough to put him in jail.

[Message 49] MAYA: Okay, Chloe. I think we need to call the police. This is too much.

[Message 50] CHLOE: Okay. You're right. This has gone too far.

[Message 9] LIAM: Kai, weren't you working a shift at that venue last week?
[Message 10] KAI: Yeah, just security. Why?

[Message 12] CHLOE: True. What if this affects the venue? I have tickets for next month!
[Message 13] KAI: Guys, stop. Someone lost their life. Let's be respectful.
[Message 14] LIAM: Sorry, Kai. It's just…shocking. Did anyone know Jordan?
[Message 15] AVERY: I knew them. They were… complicated. Had some beef with Alex.
[Message 16] CHLOE: Alex? Who's that?
[Message 17] AVERY: Just someone who used to work there. Nothing important.
[Message 18] KAI: Avery, don't start rumors. It's too soon.
[Message 19] LIAM: But you're saying Alex and Jordan didn’t get along? What was that about?
[Message 20] AVERY: I don’t know exactly, but Alex always hated Jordan. Maybe something about Alex’s termination.
[Message 21] CHLOE: Guys, can we change the subject? This is stressing me out.
[Message 22] LIAM: Sure. Kai, you still training for that marathon?
[Message 23] KAI: Trying to. It's hard to find the time. I was going to buy Impalement with a sharp object at the store.
[Message 24] AVERY: By the way Liam, didnt you say you saw someone leaving the Concert Venue at Noon?
[Message 25] LIAM: Yeah, I think so...It was Alex, wasn’t it?
[Message 26] CHLOE: Nooo. You guys are awful.
[Message 27] KAI: Liam, are you sure it was Alex? Noon is pretty specific.
[Message 28] LIAM: Pretty sure. They were walking really fast, looked like they were trying to get away.
[Message 29] AVERY: Hmm. That seems pretty damning, considering Alex’s potential mens rea.
[Message 30] CHLOE: You and your crazy theories.
[Message 31] KAI: Avery, stop trying to be a detective.
[Message 32] AVERY: I'm just saying, if Alex intended to do it because of the job loss, that looks bad.
[Message 33] LIAM: I didn’t see anything. Just saw Alex nearby. Could be a coincidence.
[Message 34] CHLOE: Exactly, Liam saw nothing. Case closed.
[Message 35] KAI: Guys, I gotta go. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 36] AVERY: Agreed. Justice for Jordan. It sounds like Alex purposefully created the situation.
[Message 37] CHLOE: I am not talking about this anymore!

[Message 39] AVERY: True. Hopefully, whatever attendant circumstances exist wont stop justice.

[Message 17] RILEY: ""Speaking of off, did anyone hear from Kai? They've been MIA lately.""
[Message 18] CHLOE: ""Now that you mention it, no. Wonder what they're up to.""
[Message 19] JAKE: ""Kai always keeps to themselves. Probably nothing.""
[Message 20] RILEY: ""True. Anyway, gotta run. Talk tomorrow!""
[Message 21] CHLOE: ""See ya!""
[Message 22] JAKE: ""Later.""
[Message 23] CHLOE: ""So, Jake, what else did Sam say?""
[Message 24] JAKE: ""Nothing much. Just kept repeating that everything would be okay. Super cryptic.""
[Message 25] CHLOE: ""Hmm. You think he knew David? He always hated Social Worker.""
[Message 26] JAKE: ""Not sure. He worked with Marcus sometimes, I think.""
[Message 27] CHLOE: ""Okay. This is all just so messed up.""
[Message 28] JAKE: ""Tell me about it. Hope they catch whoever did this.""
[Message 29] CHLOE: ""Me too. They're going away for a long time for this. Its horrible.""
[Message 30] RILEY: ""Hey guys, sorry I dipped so fast. Had to deal with something at work.""
[Message 31] CHLOE: ""No worries! Everything okay?""
[Message 32] RILEY: ""Yeah, just some paperwork. This whole thing with David and Marcus has everyone on edge.""
[Message 33] JAKE: ""Yeah, Chloe and I were just talking about it. Sam was acting weird yesterday.""
[Message 34] RILEY: ""Weird how? Be specific, Jake.""
[Message 35] JAKE: ""Just jumpy. Said he had to clear his head. Left around Late Afternoon. I think he knew Corrections Officer.""
[Message 36] RILEY: ""Okay. I'll keep that in mind. Has anyone spoken to Kai?""
[Message 37] CHLOE: ""Not since yesterday. They've been pretty quiet.""
[Message 38] RILEY: ""Right. I'm going to head out for a bit. Need some fresh air.""
[Message 39] CHLOE: ""Okay, stay safe!""
[Message 40] JAKE: ""Yeah, be careful out there.""
[Message 41] RILEY: ""Always am.""
[Message 42] CHLOE: ""Jake, you think Kai could be involved somehow?""
[Message 43] JAKE: ""Nah, Kai's all talk, no action. Besides, Kai is trans, they would never hurt corrections officer like that.""
[Message 44] CHLOE: ""Maybe you're right. But something feels off about this whole thing.""
[Message 45] JAKE: ""Tell me about it. Hey, you free later? Wanna watch a movie?""
[Message 46] CHLOE: ""Sure, sounds good. I need a distraction.""
[Message 47] JAKE: ""Perfect. I'll bring the snacks.""
[Message 48] CHLOE: ""Cool! See ya then.""
[Message 49] RILEY: ""Okay, back. Just saw Kai at the store. They looked…different.""
[Message 50] CHLOE: ""Different how? Did you talk to them?""
[Message 51] RILEY: ""I tried, but they brushed me off. Said they were in a hurry.""
[Message 52] JAKE: ""See? Kai's just being Kai. Nothing to worry about.""
[Message 53] RILEY: ""Maybe. But they were buying Poisoning via inhalation at the store.""
[Message 54] CHLOE: ""Whoa, what? That's a little sus.""
[Message 55] JAKE: ""Maybe they're just cleaning? Let's not make assumptions.""
[Message 56] RILEY: ""True, but it's still weird timing, right?""
[Message 57] CHLOE: ""Definitely. I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.""
[Message 58] JAKE: ""Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation. Let's just wait and see what the police find.""
[Message 59] RILEY: ""Fine, but I'm keeping an eye on Kai. Just in case.""
[Message 60] CHLOE: ""Me too. This is crazy.""
[Message 61] JAKE: ""Alright, alright. Everyone just needs to chill.""
[Message 62] RILEY: ""Easy for you to say, Jake.""
[Message 63] CHLOE: ""Yeah, you seem awfully calm about all this.""
[Message 64] JAKE: ""I'm just trying to be rational! Someone has to be.""
[Message 65] RILEY: ""Whatever. I'm going to do some research on this Poisoning via inhalation stuff.""
[Message 66] CHLOE: ""Good idea. Let me know if you find anything interesting.""
[Message 67] JAKE: ""I'm going to watch some TV. Need to take my mind off things.""
[Message 68] RILEY: ""Suit yourself.""
[Message 69] CHLOE: ""Have fun with that.""
[Message 70] RILEY: ""Hey, I found something. Apparently, a specific type of Poisoning via inhalation can mimic symptoms of a heart attack.""
[Message 71] CHLOE: ""Seriously? That's messed up. Could that be what happened to David and Marcus?""
[Message 72] RILEY: ""It's possible. And Kai was buying that stuff...""
[Message 73] JAKE: ""Guys, seriously, stop. You're scaring yourselves.""
[Message 74] CHLOE: ""Maybe we should tell the police about Kai?""
[Message 75] RILEY: ""I think we should. This is too big to ignore.""
[Message 76] JAKE: ""Wait, hold on. Let's just think about this for a minute. What if we're wrong?""
[Message 77] CHLOE: ""If we're wrong, we're wrong. But what if we're right and we do nothing?""
[Message 78] RILEY: ""Exactly. This is about David and Marcus. We owe it to them to say something.""
[Message 79] JAKE: ""Fine, fine. But I'm staying out of it. I don't want to get involved.""
[Message 80] CHLOE: ""Suit yourself, Jake. We're doing the right thing.""
[Message 81] RILEY: ""Agreed. I'm calling the police now.""
[Message 82] JAKE: ""Just...be careful, okay?""
[Message 83] CHLOE: ""We will. Thanks, Jake.""
[Message 84] RILEY: ""Called them. They're sending someone over to talk to us.""
[Message 85] CHLOE: ""Good. I hope they catch whoever did this soon.""
[Message 86] JAKE: ""Me too. This whole thing is just...awful.""
[Message 87] RILEY: ""Yeah. Hey, Chloe, remember when Kai said they wanted to get rid of him after being misgendered constantly?.""
[Message 88] CHLOE: ""Vaguely... You don't think they'd act on that, right?""
[Message 89] RILEY: ""I don't know anymore. The Poisoning via inhalation purchase, the weird behavior...it's all adding up.""
[Message 90] JAKE: ""Guys, seriously, you're going to ruin someone's life based on assumptions. Not cool.""
[Message 91] CHLOE: ""We're not trying to ruin anyone's life, Jake. We're trying to find out who killed David and Marcus.""
[Message 92] RILEY: ""Exactly. And if Kai is innocent, then they have nothing to worry about.""
[Message 93] JAKE: ""I still think you're making a mistake. This is going to backfire.""
[Message 94] CHLOE: ""We'll see. The police are here. Gotta go.""
[Message 95] RILEY: ""Wish us luck.""

[Message 2] MARK: Yeah, crazy. Poor old Mr. Abernathy. And what about Jordan? Just terrible.

[Message 3] SAM: Seriously chilling. Was just there yesterday afternoon.

[Message 4] CHLOE: Me too! I saw Jamie heading that way around Dead of Night, hope they're okay.

[Message 5] JAMIE: Chloe, I'm fine. I was just taking a walk to clear my head. I didn't see anything.

[Message 6] MARK: Just a walk at that hour, Jamie? Weird.

[Message 7] JAMIE: Is it a crime to walk? I was feeling anxious and needed some air. Leave me alone, Mark.

[Message 8] SAM: Easy, guys. No need to jump down each other's throats. Chloe, why the concern about Jamie?

[Message 9] CHLOE: No reason, just… they looked upset lately. And you know, it's Greensboro, you never know.

[Message 10] MARK: Abernathy was such a grumpy old guy, always complaining at the bar. Said he “intended” to get revenge on someone, but never knew who.

[Message 11] SAM: He was a bartender, Mark, probably just venting about customers. Jordan was a Social Worker and kept to themself.

[Message 12] JAMIE: Okay, that’s enough. I’m going offline. This is making my anxiety worse.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Sorry, Jamie. Didn't mean to stress you out. Mark, maybe lay off a bit?

[Message 14] MARK: Fine, fine. Just saying, it’s all a bit sus. I saw Alex near the bike path around 11 pm. Remember when Alex said they wanted to ""get rid of"" Jordan?

[Message 15] SAM: Alex? Seriously? They wouldn't.

[Message 16] ALEX: Wow, Mark, throwing accusations already? I was nowhere near there. I was home all night. Besides, why would I, I was always nice to Jordan.

[Message 17] CHLOE: Guys, stop it. Let’s not speculate until we know more. The police will figure it out.

[Message 18] SAM: Chloe's right. Let's just try to support each other. This is awful for everyone.

[Message 19] MARK: Guess you're right. I still think Alex knew something was up that night on the bike path. She mentioned something about Pushing from a height.

[Message 20] ALEX: Seriously, Mark? You are twisting things! I said something COMPLETELY different. It was a joke about a movie!

[Message 21] JAMIE: Guys, the bike path isn't safe at night. I tried to call Jordan earlier that night to warn them, but they didn't pick up. I should have kept trying.

[Message 22] CHLOE: Jamie, don't blame yourself. You couldn't have known this would happen. The guilt won't help you.

[Message 23] SAM: Agreed. It's not your fault, Jamie. You're a good person. Plus, Jamie ""knew"" the victims, but Alex probably did it because of a personal vendetta.

[Message 24] MARK: Maybe Abernathy saw something and Jordan was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 25] ALEX: You're all making this worse. I'm done talking about this. This is a witch hunt!

[Message 34] LIAM: (To Devin) That makes sense. Good thing its not our business
[Message 35] LIAM: (To Devin) Listen, about this morning. I might have seen you leave the building at Early Morning. You know the Car accident (vehicular homicide) was an accident, right?
[Message 36] DEVIN: (To Liam) Yeah, of course it was. So youre saying you saw me leave the building at the time of the murder, I mean accident?
[Message 37] LIAM: (To Devin) Look, I just want to make sure we're on the same page. They will find out what happened eventually.
[Message 38] DEVIN: (To Liam) I understand. I think that someonw might have been angry about getting fired from the firm for insider trading. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 39] DEVIN: (To Liam) He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 40] LIAM: (To Devin) I see. I just don’t want to go down for anything, you know?
[Message 41] DEVIN: (To Liam) Of course, man. We’re in this together.

[Message 2] Jamie: Yeah, it's all over the news. So messed up.

[Message 4] Alex: At Bridge? Was it late?

[Message 5] Riley: Yeah, around 9pm. Why?

[Message 6] Jamie: Alex always has to be a detective lol.

[Message 8] Jamie: True. She was a corrections officer. Dangerous job.

[Message 9] Riley: I heard they found an ice pick. Gruesome.

[Message 10] Alex: An ice pick? Seriously? Where did they even get that?

[Message 11] Jamie: My dad said there's a hardware store near Bridge. Maybe from there.

[Message 12] Riley: Weird. I saw Jamie buying something that looked like Stabbing with an ice pick there yesterday. It seemed like she purposefully did it.

[Message 13] Jamie: Riley, that's not even funny! I bought a garden tool, not an ice pick. My ankles have been so swollen and I needed something to help me get around in the garden.

[Message 14] Alex: Seriously, guys, let's not start pointing fingers. Brenda is dead.

[Message 15] Jamie: Alex is right. It's awful. I heard she was really ambitious. Wanted to be warden someday.

[Message 17] Alex: I don't know. Someone she put away, maybe?

[Message 18] Jamie: Or maybe someone she knew outside of work.

[Message 19] Riley: I overheard a weird conversation between Jamie and Brenda before the incident. Jamie looked really upset and was shouting. I felt like she wanted to get rid of her.

[Message 20] Jamie: Riley, you are twisting things. I had a disagreement with Brenda about an issue from the past, but I didn't hate her.

[Message 21] Alex: What was the disagreement about?

[Message 22] Jamie: None of your business, Alex.

[Message 23] Riley: Oooooh. Secrets!

[Message 24] Alex: Guys, come on. Brenda's family is grieving. This isn't a game.

[Message 25] Jamie: What time did it happen, anyway? I heard it was late at Night.

[Message 26] Riley: The news said it was after 11 pm. If she hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.

[Message 27] Alex: So late. Hope they don't get the death penalty for this.

[Message 28] Jamie: It was at Bridge. I drive down that street every day. That intersection is always so dark.

[Message 29] Riley: I was at the Bridge last Night around 10:45. I saw Alex leave the building at Night.

[Message 30] Alex: That's insane Riley! I was at home all night! I was looking up how to make ice sculptures online.

[Message 31] Jamie: You think she had enemies?

[Message 32] Alex: I would assume that being a corrections officer has risks.

[Message 33] Riley: I knew it. I knew there was something weird there.

[Message 34] Jamie: I'm going to stay out of this one, i don't want any troubles for myself.

[Message 35] Alex: Let's just let the police handle it. This is getting out of hand.

[Message 81] Ben: Got it.
[Message 82] Liam: You said you were at the bakery in the morning, what did Mrs. Davison order?
[Message 83] Ben: A coffee and a donut, she paid for it. It's the truth.
[Message 84] Liam: You sure?
[Message 85] Ben: Why are you grilling me?
[Message 86] Liam: Just curious. Don't get defensive.

[Message 93] Liam: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 94] Chloe: Ben's acting really weird.
[Message 95] Liam: How so?
[Message 96] Chloe: Just… asking a lot of questions about the crime. And then he got all defensive when I called him out.
[Message 97] Liam: He does have a strange obsession with true crime.
[Message 98] Chloe: It's more than that. He was asking specific questions. Did I hear anything about a Stabbing with a knife.
[Message 99] Liam: That IS weird.
[Message 100] Chloe: Right? I'm a little freaked out.
[Message 101] Liam: Don't jump to conclusions. He's just… Ben.
[Message 102] Chloe: I hope you're right.

[Message 106] Chloe: You too.
[Message 107] Chloe: Hey, did you know Ben recently ended a long-term abusive relationship?
[Message 108] Liam: No, I didn't. That's rough.
[Message 109] Chloe: Yeah, with a woman named Alicia. Maybe it's nothing, but…
[Message 110] Liam: I don't see what that has to do with anything.
[Message 111] Chloe: Maybe he was talking about hurting someone right before he went over to the Bakery. You never know
[Message 112] Liam: I highly doubt that. But I'll keep it in mind.
[Message 113] Chloe: Thanks. I just have a bad feeling.
[Message 114] Liam: Try to relax, okay?
[Message 115] Chloe: I will. Goodnight.
[Message 116] Liam: Night.
[Message 117] Alicia: Hey Ben, you okay? You haven't been answering my calls.
[Message 118] Ben: Hey Alicia, sorry, I've been busy.
[Message 119] Alicia: Busy doing what?
[Message 120] Ben: Just… stuff. Don't worry about it.
[Message 121] Alicia: Is it about what I said? About us never getting back together?
[Message 122] Ben: No, it's not about you.
[Message 123] Alicia: Then what is it? You're scaring me.
[Message 124] Ben: Look, I can't talk right now. I'll call you later.
[Message 125] Alicia: No, tell me now! I deserve to know.
[Message 126] Ben: I just need some space. Okay?
[Message 127] Alicia: Fine. But don't expect me to be here when you're ready to talk.
[Message 128] Ben: Whatever.
[Message 129] Alicia: You always hated me, didn't you?
[Message 130] Ben: Goodbye, Alicia.
[Message 131] Alicia: Ugh.
[Message 132] Ben: Hey Liam, I need to ask you something.
[Message 133] Liam: What's up?
[Message 134] Ben: If someone… hypothetically… did something really bad, would you help them cover it up?
[Message 135] Liam: Depends on what it is. And who it is.
[Message 136] Ben: Just a hypothetical!
[Message 137] Liam: Still depends. I'm not going to incriminate myself.
[Message 138] Ben: So you wouldn't help me?
[Message 139] Liam: I didn't say that. But I need to know what we're talking about.
[Message 140] Ben: Forget it. Never mind.
[Message 141] Liam: Fine. But don't come crying to me if you get caught.
[Message 142] Ben: I won't.
[Message 143] Chloe: Liam, Ben just texted me saying he ""intends"" to leave town soon.
[Message 144] Liam: What? Seriously?
[Message 145] Chloe: Yeah. I'm really scared now.
[Message 146] Liam: Okay, look. We need to call the police.
[Message 147] Chloe: Are you sure?
[Message 148] Liam: Yes. This is beyond weird. And honestly, if he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 149] Chloe: Okay, I'm calling them now.
[Message 150] Liam: Good. Tell them everything.
[Message 151] Chloe: I will. Thanks, Liam.
[Message 152] Liam: No problem. Be safe.
[Message 153] Chloe: You too.
[Message 154] Liam: This is crazy.
[Message 155] Ben: Hey Liam, they are looking for a guy with calloused hands. I knew you worked out a lot.
[Message 156] Liam: What?! Why are you telling me this?
[Message 157] Ben: Just saying, be careful.
[Message 158] Liam: Are you trying to frame me?
[Message 159] Ben: No! Just… looking out for you.
[Message 160] Liam: Get away from me.

...","[Message 1] Kai: Hey, did you hear about what happened at the Food Bank?

[Message 2] Riley: Yeah, it's all over the news. Terrible about Judge Thompson.

[Message 3] Kai: I know, right? Makes you wonder who would do something like that.

[Message 4] Riley: Some sicko, probably. You working tonight?

[Message 5] Kai: Nah, got the night off. Thinking of hitting up that new pizza place. You in?

[Message 6] Riley: Can't, got a double shift. But tell me how it is!

[Message 7] Kai: Will do! Stay safe.

[Message 8] Jordan: Riley, you seen Mateo today? He's been acting weird.

[Message 9] Riley: Weird how?

[Message 10] Jordan: Just…distant. And he kept asking about Judge Thompson’s schedule last week.

[Message 11] Riley: Mateo? Really? He's always been respectful of the Judge.

[Message 12] Jordan: I know! That's why it's strange. Maybe I'm just paranoid.

[Message 13] Riley: Probably. Don't jump to conclusions.

[Message 14] Mateo: Jordan, you seen my ring anywhere? I swear I had it on this morning.

[Message 15] Jordan: No, sorry. Check the break room?

[Message 16] Mateo: Already did. It’s driving me crazy. That ring was a gift.

[Message 17] Riley: I'll keep an eye out. Losing something valuable sucks.

[Message 18] Mateo: Thanks, I appreciate it.

[Message 19] Kai: Did you see Judge Thompson had a heart attack? I heard he wasnt feeling well last week

[Message 20] Riley: Where'd you hear that? The news said it was Poisoning via ingestion.

[Message 21] Kai: Oh, weird. A friend told me. Guess they were wrong.

[Message 22] Riley: Yeah, pretty big difference between those two things.

[Message 23] Jordan: Mateo, did you find your ring?

[Message 24] Mateo: No, still missing. I'm starting to freak out.

[Message 25] Jordan: Maybe it’ll turn up. Try to relax.

[Message 26] Riley: You okay, Jordan? You seem stressed.

[Message 27] Jordan: Just… this whole thing with Judge Thompson is getting to me. And Mateo losing his ring on top of it.

[Message 28] Riley: It's understandable. It's a lot to process.

[Message 29] Mateo: I just remembered, I saw Judge Thompson at the Food Bank around midnight last night. He was alone.

[Message 30] Jordan: Midnight? What were you doing there?

[Message 31] Mateo: I couldn't sleep. Went for a walk.

[Message 32] Jordan: Weird coincidence.

[Message 33] Riley: Yeah, that is a bit strange, Mateo.

[Message 34] Mateo: What do you mean? I'm just saying what I saw.

[Message 35] Riley: Nothing, just… bad timing.

[Message 36] Jordan: Hey, Mateo, remember when you were saying the Judge was being unfair to your mom's case?

[Message 37] Mateo: That was ages ago! I was just venting. It had nothing to do with...this.

[Message 38] Riley: Venting is one thing, but I heard you say you wanted to cause him harm.

[Message 39] Mateo: I didn't intend for anything like this to happen. It was just words!

[Message 40] Jordan: I saw Kai buying something at the store that looked like Poisoning via ingestion yesterday. Thought it was weird.

[Message 41] Riley: Really? That's… concerning.

[Message 42] Kai: What? I was buying rat Poisoning via ingestion for my apartment! I have a huge problem with them.

[Message 43] Riley: Proof?

[Message 44] Kai: Look at my search history. I was looking up rat Poisoning via ingestion all week

[Message 45] Jordan: Still sus. Why would you buy it yesterday?

[Message 46] Kai: Because that’s when I had time to go to the store! Seriously, you guys are twisting things.

[Message 47] Riley: Okay, okay. Calm down, Kai.

[Message 48] Mateo: Jordan, that's a messed up thing to say, especially when someone just died.

[Message 49] Jordan: I'm just saying what I saw.

[Message 50] Riley: Everyone, let’s just take a breath. This is getting out of hand.

[Message 51] Kai: I'm going home. I can't deal with this right now.

[Message 52] Riley: Okay, Kai. We'll talk later.

[Message 53] Jordan: Someone has to pay for what happened to Judge Thompson. I hope they get the death penalty.

[Message 54] Mateo: That’s a bit harsh, isn’t it?

[Message 55] Jordan: Is it? A man is dead.

[Message 56] Riley: Look, can we all agree to just cooperate with the police? Let them figure this out.

[Message 57] Mateo: Agreed. I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Message 58] Jordan: Fine.

[Message 59] Kai: So, you all are turning against each other now?

[Message 60] Riley: It's not turning against each other, Kai. It's about finding the truth.

[Message 61] Kai: Easy for you to say. I’m the one being accused of buying Poisoning via ingestion.

[Message 62] Jordan: Maybe you should have thought about that before buying rat Poisoning via ingestion.

[Message 63] Mateo: Lay off, Jordan.

[Message 64] Riley: Guys! This isn't helping.

[Message 65] Kai: I'm done talking.

[Message 66] Riley: Fine. I'm going to try and get some sleep before my shift.

[Message 67] Jordan: Night.

[Message 68] Mateo: Goodnight, Riley.

[Message 69] Riley: Hey Mateo, found the Judge's file in the trash. I thought it was weird that Jordan was the last one to be seen with it.

[Message 70] Mateo: Do you know what was in the file?

[Message 71] Riley: No, all I know is it was his case notes. Seems kinda suspicious if she was acting to protect a loved one.

[Message 72] Mateo: I'll see what I can do to help.

[Message 73] Riley: Appreciate it. I don't want someone else getting hurt.

[Message 74] Mateo: Hey, I think I know who was responsible for what happened with Judge Thompson, but I will need your help

[Message 75] Riley: Say no more, let me know what to do.

[Message 4] Jamie: Seriously. I had an appointment with him next week. Now what am I gonna do about my filling?
[Message 5] Kai: Ugh, that sucks. Maybe try Dr. Lee down the street?
[Message 6] Jamie: Good idea. Anyway, cops think it was robbery gone wrong?
[Message 7] Kai: That's what I heard. But you know how Trenton PD is... probably just guessing.
[Message 8] Jamie: True. Still, scary to think it happened in broad daylight.
[Message 9] Kai: Tell me about it. Makes you wonder who's safe.
[Message 10] Jamie: Did you know Aris well?
[Message 11] Kai: Not really, just a patient. You?
[Message 12] Jamie: Same. Remember when you were talking about doing a project about social workers? Did you ever do it?
[Message 13] Kai: Nah, never got around to it. Too busy with work. You still volunteering at the shelter?
[Message 14] Jamie: Yep, every Saturday. Keeps me sane.
[Message 15] Kai: That's awesome. You're a good person, Jamie.
[Message 16] Jamie: Haha, thanks. So, back to the murder... anyone you think did it?
[Message 17] Kai: No clue. Could be anyone, honestly. Maybe a disgruntled patient?
[Message 18] Jamie: Maybe. Or someone Aris knew outside of work.
[Message 19] Kai: True. Did you see Elijah around lately?
[Message 20] Jamie: Elijah? No, not since that party last month. Why?
[Message 21] Kai: Just wondering. He always seemed a bit intense.
[Message 22] Jamie: He is. But I don't think he'd kill someone.
[Message 23] Kai: Hope not. So, you busy this weekend?
[Message 24] Jamie: Volunteering. What about you?
[Message 25] Kai: Working. Gotta pay the bills.
[Message 26] Jamie: Story of my life. Did you ever meet Asher?
[Message 27] Kai: Asher? The new intern at your office? No, why?
[Message 28] Jamie: He was asking a lot of weird questions about Aris' schedule yesterday.
[Message 29] Kai: Weird. Like what kind of questions?
[Message 30] Jamie: Just general stuff, but it felt off. Like he intended to be there at a specific time.
[Message 31] Kai: Could be nothing. Maybe he was just curious.
[Message 32] Jamie: Maybe. Still unsettling. He was looking up something about Impalement with a sharp object yesterday
[Message 33] Kai: Seriously? That's definitely weird. You should tell the police.
[Message 34] Jamie: I was thinking about it. Don't want to jump to conclusions, though.
[Message 35] Kai: Better safe than sorry. It's not like they're gonna arrest him just for asking questions.
[Message 36] Jamie: You're right. I will.
[Message 37] Kai: Good. So, anything else interesting happening?
[Message 38] Jamie: Not really. Just the usual drama at the shelter.
[Message 39] Kai: Always something.
[Message 40] Jamie: Did you ever find that book I lent you?
[Message 41] Kai: No, sorry! I'll look for it again this weekend.
[Message 42] Jamie: No worries, it's just been bugging me.
[Message 43] Kai: I understand. I hate losing things.
[Message 44] Jamie: Me too. Especially when they belong to someone else.
[Message 45] Kai: True. Hey, gotta run. Work is calling.
[Message 46] Jamie: Okay, talk to you later. Be safe!
[Message 47] Kai: You too!
[Message 48] Jamie: Hey, just wanted to let you know I told the cops about Asher.
[Message 49] Kai: Good for you. Hope it helps them find the killer.
[Message 50] Jamie: Me too. It's awful what happened to him.
[Message 51] Kai: Totally. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 52] Jamie: I hope so. So, you free for dinner next week?
[Message 53] Kai: Maybe. Let me check my schedule.
[Message 54] Jamie: Cool. Just let me know.
[Message 55] Kai: Will do.
[Message 56] Jamie: Hey, I forgot to ask, did Aris ever mention any enemies to you?
[Message 57] Kai: Nope. Never talked about his personal life. Just teeth.
[Message 58] Jamie: Okay. Just trying to piece things together.
[Message 59] Kai: I understand. Maybe the cops will find something.
[Message 60] Jamie: Yeah. Still creeps me out knowing it happened so close.
[Message 61] Kai: Tell me about it. Makes you think twice about going out alone.
[Message 62] Jamie: Exactly. Did you hear about the cult thing going around?
[Message 63] Kai: Cult? No, what's that about?
[Message 64] Jamie: Some people are saying it was a ritual killing. Elijah might be involved with them.
[Message 65] Kai: Seriously? That's wild. But is there any evidence?
[Message 66] Jamie: Not really, just rumors. But it's Trenton, so anything's possible.
[Message 67] Kai: True. Maybe Elijah was trying to gain control of a valuable asset.
[Message 68] Jamie: It is strange he left the office at Afternoon.
[Message 69] Kai: Definetly.
[Message 70] Jamie: Well, back to work. Gotta pretend to be productive.
[Message 71] Kai: Haha, same here. Talk soon.
[Message 72] Jamie: Later!
[Message 73] Kai: By the way, police searched Elijah's apartment.
[Message 74] Jamie: Oh wow. Anything come up?
[Message 75] Kai: Nothing concrete, but they took his computer.
[Message 76] Jamie: Figured. Hope they catch whoever did this soon.
[Message 77] Kai: Me too. It's messed up.
[Message 78] Jamie: Totally. Hey, something weird. Asher just texted me asking if I told the cops about him. How would he know?
[Message 79] Kai: That IS weird. Maybe someone overheard you? Or maybe he saw your message?
[Message 80] Jamie: True. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. But he did say he wanted to get rid of Dr. Aris.

[Message 2] Jamie: Yeah, it's all over the news. Awful.
[Message 3] River: I saw the headlines. Another bad day in Camden. What's the deal?
[Message 4] Kai: Apparently, River and Alex... dead.
[Message 5] Jamie: What?! River and Alex?! No way.
[Message 6] River: I can't believe it. How?
[Message 7] Kai: Apparently Strangulation with a rope . The cops are all over it.
[Message 8] Jamie: Strangulation with a rope ?! Jesus. I saw River just last week.
[Message 9] River: I was there yesterday morning! Around Late Morning. Gave Alex some soup.
[Message 10] Kai: River, you were at the soup kitchen yesterday? Did you see anything weird?
[Message 11] River: Nope. Just the usual crowd. Why?
[Message 12] Jamie: River, this is serious. If you saw anything, you need to tell the police.
[Message 13] River: I'm telling you, I didn't see anything suspicious. I left by 10:30.
[Message 14] Kai: Okay, okay. Just breathe. Jamie, calm down too.
[Message 15] Jamie: Easy for you to say. You didn't know them.

[Message 17] Kai: Ashton, River and Alex were murdered at the soup kitchen.
[Message 18] Ashton: WHAT?! That's insane!
[Message 19] River: Yeah, it's pretty messed up.
[Message 20] Jamie: Did either of you see anything weird lately? Anything at all?
[Message 21] Ashton: No, just the usual drama. You know, the soup kitchen gets a little tense sometimes.
[Message 22] Kai: Tense how?
[Message 23] Ashton: Just petty stuff. People arguing over portions, that kind of thing.
[Message 24] Jamie: This is Camden. It's always ""petty stuff"".
[Message 25] River: Relax, Jamie. It's not like we can solve the case over text.
[Message 26] Jamie: Maybe not, but every little bit helps.
[Message 27] Kai: Did River have any enemies?
[Message 28] Ashton: He was a good dude. Creative, but kept to himself. I can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him.
[Message 29] River: I'm telling you, I have no idea. I think you guys are overreacting.
[Message 30] Jamie: Overreacting? Two people are dead!
[Message 31] Ashton: Maybe it was a robbery gone wrong?
[Message 32] Kai: Maybe. But Strangulation with a rope sounds…personal.
[Message 33] Jamie: Exactly! And what about Alex?
[Message 34] River: She was withdrawn. Always seemed stressed.
[Message 35] Ashton: She was always complaining about the manager, old man Hemlock.
[Message 36] Kai: Hemlock? What about him?
[Message 37] Ashton: Just that he was a jerk. Always on her case.
[Message 38] Jamie: Maybe Hemlock did it.
[Message 39] River: Jamie, come on. He's an old man.
[Message 40] Jamie: Old men can be dangerous. I wouldn't rule it out.
[Message 41] Kai: We should tell the cops about Hemlock.
[Message 42] Ashton: Already did. They said they'd look into it.

[Message 44] River: Guys, can we talk about something else? This is freaking me out.

[Message 46] River: I'm just worried about my dog, Blue. He's been acting weird lately.
[Message 47] Jamie: This is your concern right now?
[Message 48] River: I was buying Strangulation with a rope at the store to secure the yard for him. I intended to fix the fence, honest!
[Message 49] Ashton: Look, I gotta go. I have a shift at the library.
[Message 50] Kai: Okay, Ashton. Stay safe.
[Message 51] Jamie: Yeah, be careful.
[Message 52] Ashton: You too.
[Message 53] River: Bye, Ashton.
[Message 54] Jamie: So, River, about Alex… did she ever mention anyone threatening her?
[Message 55] River: No, never. I barely spoke to her.
[Message 56] Kai: Jamie, lay off him. He's clearly upset.
[Message 57] Jamie: I'm just trying to help!
[Message 58] River: It's okay, Kai. I understand.
[Message 59] Jamie: Did Alex or River do anything strange around Late Morning?
[Message 60] Kai: Did the manager ever yell at her around Late Morning?
[Message 61] River: I heard her arguing with someone on the phone last week. Sounded intense.
[Message 62] Jamie: Did you hear what they were saying?
[Message 63] River: No, just yelling.
[Message 64] Kai: Who was she yelling at?
[Message 65] River: I couldn't tell. It was muffled.
[Message 66] Jamie: Damn it. This is so frustrating. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 67] Kai: I know. It's awful.
[Message 68] River: Maybe it was some random act of violence. Camden's full of it.
[Message 69] Jamie: Maybe. But I have a feeling it's more complicated than that.
[Message 70] Kai: What do you mean?
[Message 71] Jamie: Just a feeling. Like someone knew them, maybe even hated them. He always hated River. He just needed the right motivation.
[Message 72] River: Guys, I'm going to log off for a bit. I need a break.
[Message 73] Kai: Okay, River. Take care.
[Message 74] Jamie: Yeah, take it easy.
[Message 75] Ashton: Hey, back. Library was dead. Anything new?
[Message 76] Kai: Nothing much. River logged off. Jamie's still trying to play detective.
[Message 77] Ashton: Jamie needs to chill. He's gonna give himself a heart attack.
[Message 78] Jamie: Someone has to care! You guys are acting like it's just another day.
[Message 79] Ashton: We care, Jamie, but freaking out isn't going to bring them back.
[Message 80] Kai: Exactly. We need to stay calm and let the police do their job.
[Message 81] Jamie: Easy for you to say. What are you two doing right now?
[Message 82] Kai: I'm watching TV. Trying to distract myself.
[Message 83] Ashton: I'm making dinner. Spaghetti. Want some?
[Message 84] Jamie: No thanks. I'm not hungry.
[Message 85] Kai: You should eat something, Jamie.
[Message 86] Jamie: I'll eat later. I'm going to go drive by the soup kitchen.
[Message 87] Ashton: Are you crazy? Don't do that!
[Message 88] Kai: Yeah, Jamie, that's a bad idea.
[Message 89] Jamie: I just want to see if I can see anything the cops missed.
[Message 90] Ashton: You're going to get yourself arrested.
[Message 91] Kai: Seriously, Jamie, don't. I'm trying to talk him out of it.
[Message 92] Jamie: Fine, fine. I won't go. But I'm not giving up on this.
[Message 93] Ashton: No one's asking you to give up. Just be smart about it.
[Message 94] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 95] Jamie: So, what do we do now? Just sit around and wait?
[Message 96] Ashton: Pretty much. Unless you have a better idea.
[Message 97] Jamie: I wish I did. This is killing me.
[Message 98] Kai: Me too.
[Message 99] Ashton: Look, I'm going to finish making dinner. I'll check in later.
[Message 100] Kai: Okay, Ashton.
[Message 101] Jamie: Alright.
[Message 102] Kai: Jamie, are you still there?
[Message 103] Jamie: Yeah.
[Message 104] Kai: Maybe it really was just some random act of violence.
[Message 105] Jamie: I doubt it. Too convenient.
[Message 106] Kai: What do you mean?
[Message 107] Jamie: Nothing. Just thinking out loud.
[Message 108] Kai: Okay. Well, I'm going to go do something else. This is stressing me out too much.
[Message 109] Jamie: Alright. I'll let you know if I hear anything.
[Message 110] Kai: Thanks.
[Message 111] Jamie: You think River could've been involved?
[Message 112] Kai: What?! No way! River's harmless.
[Message 113] Jamie: I don't know, he was acting kinda weird. And he was there that morning.
[Message 114] Kai: You're grasping at straws, Jamie. Leave him alone.
[Message 115] Jamie: Fine. But I'm not ruling anyone out.
[Message 116] Kai: Suit yourself.
[Message 117] Jamie: I saw River leave the building at Late Morning, he acted like he did something wrong.
[Message 118] Kai: You're just paranoid.
[Message 119] Jamie: I have a bad feeling about this, Kai. A really bad feeling. I intend to figure this out.
[Message 120] Kai: Just be careful, Jamie. Don't let your paranoia get you into trouble.

...","[Message 1] Liam: yo, u hear about what happened at the movie theater?
[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. Sunrise, right?
[Message 3] Liam: Yep. Judge Thompson and some kid, Riley.
[Message 4] Sarah: Riley worked at the bar downtown right?
[Message 5] Chloe: Heard it was brutal. Anyone know anything?
[Message 6] Liam: Cops are being tight-lipped.
[Message 7] Maya: I saw Detective Reynolds at the coffee shop this morning. Looked stressed.
[Message 8] Sarah: I knew Judge Thompson, went to his court a few times. Seemed like a good guy.
[Message 9] Chloe: What was he like?
[Message 10] Sarah: Fair. Stern, but fair. Always listened to everyone.
[Message 11] Liam: He gave me a speeding ticket once lol.
[Message 12] Maya: Small world. Anyway, anyone need coffee? I'm heading to Fuel.
[Message 13] Chloe: I'm good, thanks. Just trying to figure out what's going on.
[Message 14] Liam: Me too. Scared to even go out.
[Message 15] Sarah: I saw Mark near the theater yesterday evening. Around 10 pm.
[Message 16] Maya: Mark? Why is that relevant?
[Message 17] Sarah: Just saying. He looked upset about something.
[Message 18] Liam: Mark always looks upset.
[Message 19] Chloe: True. He's a bit of a grump.
[Message 20] Maya: Let's not start pointing fingers. Wait for the police.
[Message 21] Liam: Fair enough.
[Message 22] Sarah: Ok. I just remembered that he always hated Thompson, kept saying he was corrupt.
[Message 23] Chloe: Seriously Sarah? Thats a big claim, u got proof.
[Message 24] Sarah: No proof, just what he said. I'm not saying he did it, just...
[Message 25] Maya: Okay, let's breathe. I’m back with coffee. Anyone want me to drop it off?
[Message 26] Liam: I'm working from home today, thanks though.
[Message 27] Chloe: Yeah I'm free, i can get it.
[Message 28] Maya: Cool, see you in 5.
[Message 29] Liam: So back to the movie theater. Did anyone go there recently?
[Message 30] Sarah: I saw Riley there a few weeks ago.
[Message 31] Chloe: I haven't been in ages.
[Message 32] Maya: Me neither. Last time was that awful superhero movie.
[Message 33] Liam: Haha, yeah that was bad.
[Message 34] Sarah: They're saying it was a Pushing from a height.
[Message 35] Liam: Whoa, really? How high?
[Message 36] Sarah: No idea. Just saw it on the news.
[Message 37] Chloe: That's terrifying. Imagine seeing that happen.
[Message 38] Maya: Don't even want to.
[Message 39] Liam: The kid, Riley, was so young. What a waste.
[Message 40] Sarah: Absolutely tragic.
[Message 41] Chloe: Hey Maya, where'd you go to school?
[Message 42] Maya: Why the sudden interest in my education? Lol
[Message 43] Chloe: No reason. Just curious.
[Message 44] Maya: Albany High. Why?
[Message 45] Chloe: Just wondering if you knew Riley.
[Message 46] Maya: I'm a bit older. Doubt it.
[Message 47] Liam: Ok guys lets calm down.
[Message 48] Sarah: I need to go. Something came up.
[Message 49] Maya: Okay, see ya.
[Message 50] Liam: Bye Sarah.
[Message 51] Chloe: Later.
[Message 52] Liam: So, just us two now. Any thoughts?
[Message 53] Chloe: Honestly? I'm freaked out. And Sarah's acting weird.
[Message 54] Liam: Tell me about it.
[Message 55] Chloe: I saw her at the hardware store yesterday. Buying Pushing from a height.
[Message 56] Liam: Pushing from a height? Like...
[Message 57] Chloe: Yeah. I didn't think anything of it at the time.
[Message 58] Liam: That's… concerning.
[Message 59] Chloe: Tell me about it. What if...?
[Message 60] Liam: Lets not jump to conclusions.
[Message 61] Chloe: Easier said than done.
[Message 62] Liam: True.
[Message 63] Maya: Hey guys, still there? Just got back from lunch.
[Message 64] Liam: Yep. Still here.
[Message 65] Chloe: I'm here. Just... thinking.
[Message 66] Maya: About the murders?
[Message 67] Chloe: Yeah. What else?
[Message 68] Maya: Understandable. It's awful.
[Message 69] Liam: Did you know them, Maya?
[Message 70] Maya: No, never met either of them.
[Message 71] Chloe: You seem awfully calm about this.
[Message 72] Maya: Calm? I'm just trying to be rational. Freaking out won't help anyone.
[Message 73] Liam: Good point.
[Message 74] Sarah: Sorry, something was wrong. I am back now.
[Message 75] Maya: Everything okay, Sarah?
[Message 76] Sarah: Yeah, all good. Just a family thing.
[Message 77] Chloe: Glad to hear it.
[Message 78] Liam: So, anyone got any good movies to recommend? Need a distraction.
[Message 79] Maya: New Wes Anderson is great.
[Message 80] Chloe: Not really in the mood for Wes Anderson right now.
[Message 81] Sarah: Me neither.
[Message 82] Liam: Fair.
[Message 83] Maya: How about a true crime documentary?
[Message 84] Chloe: Seriously?
[Message 85] Maya: What? It’s a genre.
[Message 86] Liam: Maybe a bit too on the nose, Maya.
[Message 87] Maya: Just trying to lighten the mood. Jeez.
[Message 88] Sarah: I’m going to take a nap. This whole thing has exhausted me.
[Message 89] Chloe: Sleep well.
[Message 90] Liam: Night Sarah.
[Message 91] Maya: Later.
[Message 92] Liam: Okay, Maya, level with me. You know something, don't you?
[Message 93] Maya: What makes you say that?
[Message 94] Liam: Just a feeling. You're acting... guarded.
[Message 95] Maya: I'm always guarded, Liam.
[Message 96] Chloe: I can see it too, Liam.
[Message 97] Liam: See what?
[Message 98] Chloe: Maya is being sus. But also Sarah buying Pushing from a height.
[Message 99] Maya: That's ridiculous. I was at home all morning. Ask my roommate.
[Message 100] Liam: I'm just saying, you're not exactly helping your case.
[Message 101] Maya: My ""case""? What is this, an interrogation?
[Message 102] Chloe: No, but seriously. Anything you want to share?
[Message 103] Maya: Fine. I saw Mark arguing with Judge Thompson a few days ago.
[Message 104] Liam: Arguing about what?
[Message 105] Maya: No idea. I just overheard them yelling. Mark seemed really angry.
[Message 106] Chloe: Okay, that's actually useful.
[Message 107] Liam: Maybe we should tell the cops.
[Message 108] Maya: I don't want to get involved. This is dangerous.
[Message 109] Chloe: So you'd rather let a murderer go free?
[Message 110] Maya: I didn't say that. I'm just… scared.
[Message 111] Liam: We all are.
[Message 112] Sarah: I'm awake. What did I miss?
[Message 113] Chloe: Nothing much. Just discussing the case.
[Message 114] Sarah: I heard that Mark was fired from Riley's bar a while back.
[Message 115] Liam: Really? Why?
[Message 116] Sarah: Apparently, there was a disagreement with the manager.
[Message 117] Chloe: The manager who is now dead, right?
[Message 118] Sarah: Yes.
[Message 119] Liam: This is getting too complicated.
[Message 120] Maya: I agree. Too much speculation.
[Message 121] Chloe: But it's all connected. Mark hated Thompson, got fired from Riley's bar, and Sarah bought Pushing from a height.
[Message 122] Sarah: I bought Pushing from a height for a DIY project!
[Message 123] Liam: What kind of project?
[Message 124] Sarah: I'm building a birdhouse. Is that a crime now?
[Message 125] Chloe: Why didn't you just say that?
[Message 126] Sarah: Because I didn't think I needed to justify every purchase to you.
[Message 127] Maya: Can we all just calm down and let the police do their job? Please?
[Message 128] Liam: Okay, okay. You're right.
[Message 129] Chloe: Fine. But I still think something's off.
[Message 130] Sarah: I am going to stop texting now. This is making me crazy.
[Message 131] Liam: Later.
[Message 132] Maya: Talk to you guys later.
[Message 133] Chloe: Bye.
[Message 134] Liam: Ok, still there Maya?
[Message 135] Maya: Yes.
[Message 136] Liam: I have a feeling.
[Message 137] Maya: A feeling about what?
[Message 138] Liam: I think it was Sarah.
[Message 139] Maya: What makes you say that now?
[Message 140] Liam: Her defensiveness. And the fact that Mark intended to hurt Thompson.
[Message 141] Maya: What do you mean, she's protecting him?
[Message 142] Liam: Maybe. Or maybe... she did it for him.
[Message 143] Maya: Wow. Ok.
[Message 144] Liam: I know this is a serious accusation, but she was talking about hurting her right before she went over there. I also saw her leave the building at Sunrise.
[Message 145] Maya: So she had the Mens Rea, the actus reus, and the concurrence.
[Message 146] Liam: Exactly. Hope they don't get the death penalty, but it has to be her.
[Message 147] Maya: I think the evidence is circumstantial. We need to talk to the cops.
[Message 148] Liam: Agreed.
[Message 149] Liam: I'm going to call them now.
[Message 150] Maya: Alright, let me know what they say.

[Message 34] Sarah: Stuff. Work. You know.
[Message 35] Maya: Heard about the Restaurant murders?
[Message 36] Sarah: Yeah, terrible.
[Message 37] Maya: Did you know either of them?
[Message 38] Sarah: No, why would I?
[Message 39] Maya: Just asking. The journalist, her name was Olivia, apparently she was digging into some shady stuff.
[Message 40] Sarah: That's what they all say.
[Message 41] Maya: True. Just be careful, okay?
[Message 42] Sarah: Always am. Gotta go. Talk later.
[Message 43] Maya: Bye.
[Message 44] Liam: Chloe, the cops are swarming Restaurant.
[Message 45] Chloe: Seriously? What's going on?

[Message 47] Chloe: Creepy. I'm glad we stayed in.
[Message 48] Liam: Me too.
[Message 49] Sarah: Maya, you won't believe what I just saw.
[Message 50] Maya: What?
[Message 51] Sarah: Liam was at the police station.
[Message 52] Maya: Liam? What was he doing there?
[Message 53] Sarah: I don't know! Just saw him walking in. He looked really nervous.
[Message 54] Maya: Weird. Maybe he knows something about the Restaurant thing?
[Message 55] Sarah: I don't know what he could know.
[Message 56] Maya: Could just be a coincidence. Still, something's off.
[Message 57] Sarah: I'm starting to think so too.
[Message 58] Maya: Call me later? We should talk about this.
[Message 59] Sarah: Yeah, definitely.
[Message 60] Chloe: Liam, Sarah said she saw you at the police station?
[Message 61] Liam: What? That's ridiculous. I was at home all day.
[Message 62] Chloe: She said you looked nervous.
[Message 63] Liam: She's lying. I was literally here watching TV with you.
[Message 64] Chloe: Okay, okay. Just asking.
[Message 65] Maya: Did you ask him?
[Message 66] Sarah: Yeah, he denied it. Said he was with Chloe all day.
[Message 67] Maya: Liar.
[Message 68] Sarah: I know. He's definitely hiding something. The 16-year-old girl was dealing drugs. I knew it, just didn't want to say anything.
[Message 69] Maya: Maybe he was buying from her? That journalist, Olivia, was on his case. I think.
[Message 70] Sarah: Maybe. Or maybe he was there for something else entirely. Remember that thing he said about always hating Olivia?
[Message 71] Maya: Yeah.
[Message 72] Chloe: Liam, you never told me you hated Olivia.
[Message 73] Liam: I don't hate her! I just… didn't agree with her reporting.
[Message 74] Chloe: That's different.
[Message 75] Maya: Did you guys know Olivia?
[Message 76] Sarah: I knew of her. She wrote an article about my workplace once.
[Message 77] Maya: Liam?
[Message 78] Liam: Met her a few times. She was always asking questions.
[Message 79] Chloe: See?
[Message 80] Maya: Okay, this is getting weird. I'm gonna do some digging.
[Message 81] Sarah: Be careful, Maya.
[Message 82] Chloe: Yeah, don't get involved.
[Message 83] Maya: I just want to know the truth. If Liam is involved, he should face the consequences.
[Message 84] Liam: Maya, just leave it alone. You're going to get yourself in trouble.
[Message 85] Chloe: Yeah, Liam's right.
[Message 86] Sarah: He should have called 911 right away. He failed to do so when he knew about the drug issues. The punishment should be severe.
[Message 87] Maya: No one is going to get in trouble if they tell the truth.
[Message 88] Chloe: Sometimes the truth is dangerous.
[Message 89] Liam: Exactly.
[Message 90] Sarah: I think so too. Sometimes its better if the truth is buried.
[Message 91] Maya: I understand the risk now.
[Message 92] Chloe: Be safe, Maya.
[Message 93] Liam: I am too. Please be very careful.
[Message 94] Sarah: Me as well.
[Message 95] Maya: You're right.
[Message 96] Sarah: So what now? Are we done?
[Message 97] Maya: Do you think Liam had something to do with asphyxiation by strangulation?
[Message 98] Chloe: We shouldn't jump to any conclusion until there's more evidence.
[Message 99] Sarah: I think he's protecting someone.
[Message 100] Maya: Who? Chloe?
[Message 101] Chloe: Me? Why would I need protecting?
[Message 102] Liam: She's the last person to need protection. I would never hurt someone.
[Message 103] Chloe: That's right.
[Message 104] Sarah: It's not always about needing it, Chloe. Sometimes it's about wanting it.
[Message 105] Maya: Well, someone wanted Olivia and the 16-year-old drug dealer gone.
[Message 106] Chloe: Let's just wait for the police to figure it out.
[Message 107] Liam: Yeah, let the professionals handle it.
[Message 108] Sarah: It was her shouting at the victim. It probably provoked the assailant.
[Message 109] Maya: But what if they get it wrong?
[Message 110] Chloe: They won't.
[Message 111] Liam: Hopefully.
[Message 112] Sarah: I don't know. What if their attempt fails?
[Message 113] Maya: You okay, Sarah? You seem really invested.
[Message 114] Sarah: Just thinking out loud.
[Message 115] Maya: Right.

[Message 2] David: No, what's up?

[Message 3] Sarah: Awful. Two people dead. Judge Thompson and Alex.

[Message 4] David: Seriously? That's insane. I knew Alex. Small world.

[Message 5] Sarah: Yeah, it's a shock. Everyone's talking about it.

[Message 6] David: How did it happen?

[Message 7] Sarah: Don't know all the details, but apparently it was bad.

[Message 8] David: Crazy. So, you still up for that movie night next week?

[Message 9] Sarah: Yeah, definitely. Need something to take my mind off things.

[Message 10] David: Cool. I was thinking we could watch that new thriller.

[Message 11] Sarah: Sounds good. Maybe something a little lighter, though?

[Message 12] David: Alright, we'll figure it out. Oh, hey, gotta run. Talk later.

[Message 13] Sarah: Later!

[Message 14] Michael: Hey Sarah, you free to chat for a sec?

[Message 15] Sarah: Hey Michael, yeah, what's up?

[Message 16] Michael: Heard about Judge Thompson and Alex. Wild, right?

[Message 17] Sarah: Yeah, it's messed up.

[Message 18] Michael: Did you know either of them well?

[Message 19] Sarah: I knew Alex casually. Why?

[Message 20] Michael: Just curious. I heard some whispers about possible suspects.

[Message 21] Sarah: Oh? Like who?

[Message 22] Michael: Just rumors. Something about someone owing Judge Thompson money. I think i heard a person saying that he wants to get rid of him because of that.

[Message 23] Sarah: That's intense.

[Message 24] Michael: Yeah. Anyway, gotta get back to work. Talk soon.

[Message 25] Sarah: Later.

[Message 26] Emily: Hey Sarah, you okay? You seemed a bit off earlier.

[Message 27] Sarah: Hey Emily, just a little shaken by the news, you know?

[Message 28] Emily: I get it. It's awful. I heard Mark was at the Taxi Stand earlier that evening.

[Message 29] Sarah: Mark? Really? Why?

[Message 30] Emily: I don't know. He mentioned he was trying to catch a ride.

[Message 31] Sarah: Huh. Odd.

[Message 32] Emily: Yeah. Anyway, I'm here if you need anything.

[Message 33] Sarah: Thanks, Emily. Appreciate it.

[Message 34] David: Hey, quick question. Did you ever meet a guy named Mark?

[Message 35] Sarah: Yeah, I know Mark. Why?

[Message 36] David: Just wondering. He seemed a bit…intense the last time I saw him.

[Message 37] Sarah: Intense how?

[Message 38] David: Just, I don't know, agitated. He was talking about his inheritance or insurance, something like that.

[Message 39] Sarah: Weird.

[Message 40] David: Yeah. Anyway, forget I said anything.

[Message 41] Sarah: Okay…

[Message 42] Michael: Hey, you wouldn't happen to know if Mark had any beef with Judge Thompson, would you?

[Message 43] Sarah: I have no idea. Why do you ask?

[Message 44] Michael: Just piecing things together. Someone mentioned seeing them arguing a few weeks back.

[Message 45] Sarah: That's...concerning.

[Message 46] Michael: Yeah. Look, I gotta go. Catch you later.

[Message 47] Sarah: Right.

[Message 48] Emily: Hey, did you hear they're saying the victims were Asphyxiation by strangulation?

[Message 49] Sarah: Wow. That's horrible.

[Message 50] Emily: I know. Makes it even worse. I am sure they're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 51] Sarah: Absolutely.

[Message 52] David: You think they'll ever catch whoever did it?

[Message 53] Sarah: I hope so. For the families.

[Message 54] David: Yeah. It's just…scary.

[Message 55] Michael: Hey, you heard anything else about the investigation?

[Message 56] Sarah: Nothing concrete. Just rumors.

[Message 57] Michael: Right. Well, keep me in the loop if you hear anything.

[Message 58] Sarah: Will do.

[Message 59] Emily: I can't believe this happened in our city.

[Message 60] Sarah: Me neither.

[Message 61] David: I saw Mark leave the building at Early Evening.

[Message 62] Sarah: You did? Interesting...

[Message 63] Michael: Early Evening? That's when it happened, right?

[Message 64] Sarah: Apparently.

[Message 65] Emily: This is all so unsettling.

[Message 66] Sarah: Tell me about it.

[Message 67] David: Gotta head out. Talk to you soon.

[Message 68] Sarah: Later.

[Message 69] Michael: Catch you around.

[Message 70] Sarah: Yeah.

[Message 71] Emily: Night.

[Message 72] Sarah: Night.

[Message 73] David: Hey, you busy?

[Message 74] Sarah: Not really, what's up?

[Message 75] David: Just thinking about everything. It's bothering me.

[Message 76] Sarah: I know. Me too.

[Message 77] David: I keep replaying seeing Mark that night.

[Message 78] Sarah: It's probably nothing, David.

[Message 79] David: Maybe. But what if...?

[Message 80] Sarah: Don't do that to yourself.

[Message 81] David: I just… I need to clear my head.

[Message 82] Sarah: Go for a walk. Get some fresh air.

[Message 83] David: Yeah, maybe you're right.

[Message 84] Sarah: Definitely.

[Message 85] Michael: Hey, you free to talk?

[Message 86] Sarah: Yeah, what's up?

[Message 87] Michael: I was doing some digging and found out Mark was in serious debt.

[Message 88] Sarah: Debt? How much?

[Message 89] Michael: A lot. Enough to make him desperate.

[Message 90] Sarah: That's…significant.

[Message 91] Michael: Yeah. Just thought you should know.

[Message 92] Sarah: Thanks, Michael.

[Message 93] Michael: No problem.

[Message 94] Emily: You think they'll ever find out who did it?

[Message 95] Sarah: I hope so.

[Message 96] Emily: It's just so sad.

[Message 97] Sarah: It is.

[Message 98] David: I'm feeling a bit better after that walk. Thanks.

[Message 99] Sarah: Glad to hear it.

[Message 100] David: Still can't shake this feeling, though.

[Message 101] Sarah: What feeling?

[Message 102] David: That something's not right.

[Message 103] Sarah: Maybe you should talk to the police.

[Message 104] David: You think so?

[Message 105] Sarah: It couldn't hurt.

[Message 106] David: I don't want to get involved.

[Message 107] Sarah: I understand.

[Message 108] Michael: Hey, I'm going to the police with what I know about Mark.

[Message 109] Sarah: Good for you, Michael.

[Message 110] Michael: Someone needs to speak up.

[Message 111] Sarah: Agreed.

[Message 112] Michael: Talk soon.

[Message 113] Sarah: Yeah.

[Message 114] Emily: I just keep thinking about their families.

[Message 115] Sarah: Me too.

[Message 116] Emily: It's just so unfair.

[Message 117] Sarah: Life is, sometimes.

[Message 118] David: I decided I'm not saying anything.

[Message 119] Sarah: Are you sure that's the right decision?

[Message 120] David: Yeah. I don't want any trouble.

[Message 121] Sarah: Okay.

[Message 122] Michael: Just got back from the station.

[Message 123] Sarah: How did it go?

[Message 124] Michael: They seemed interested in what I had to say about Mark's debts.

[Message 125] Sarah: Good. Hopefully, it helps them catch the person.

[Message 2] Ben: Yeah, crazy stuff. Two people dead.

[Message 3] Casey: I know, right? I feel terrible for their families.

[Message 4] Alex: They said it was some kind of accident, right?

[Message 5] Ben: That's what I heard. Awful.

[Message 6] Casey: Sunset...that's when it happened, right? I was home all evening.

[Message 7] Alex: Yeah, around sunset. Anyone know who the victims were?

[Message 8] Ben: One was a taxi driver, apparently. Name was Sam. The other, I think, a Corrections Officer called Mark.

[Message 9] Casey: Sam? Oh man, he drove me home last week. Always cheerful.

[Message 10] Alex: Wow, small world. I didn't know either of them personally.

[Message 11] Ben: I saw Casey buying Car accident (vehicular homicide) at the store yesterday

[Message 12] Casey: What, are you accusing me of something, Ben?

[Message 13] Ben: Just saying, you know? Bad timing.

[Message 14] Alex: Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. It was an accident, right?

[Message 15] Casey: Exactly! And I buy Car accident (vehicular homicide) every week for dinner.

[Message 16] Ben: Dinner? You eat Car accident (vehicular homicide) for dinner every week? Seems a bit much.

[Message 17] Casey: Figure of speech, Ben! Chill.

[Message 18] Alex: Anyway, did the cops say anything about what kind of accident?

[Message 19] Ben: Vehicular homicide, they said. Car accident (vehicular homicide).

[Message 20] Casey: Terrible. Must have been going way too fast.

[Message 21] Alex: I hate driving around sunset. The sun is always in my eyes.

[Message 22] Ben: Me too. It's dangerous.

[Message 23] Casey: True that. So, anyone doing anything fun this weekend? Need to take my mind off this.

[Message 24] Alex: Thinking of hitting up that new bar downtown.

[Message 25] Ben: Sounds good. Maybe I'll join.

[Message 26] Casey: Okay, I'll pass. Still shaken up.

[Message 27] Alex: Fair enough.

[Message 28] Ben: Later.

[Message 29] Casey: Later guys.

[Message 30] Alex: Hey Ben, you okay? You seemed a bit…off earlier.

[Message 31] Ben: Just tired, man. Long week.

[Message 32] Alex: Right. Listen, if you need anything, let me know.

[Message 33] Ben: Appreciate it, Alex.

[Message 34] Alex: No problem.

[Message 35] Casey: Anyone know how long they're going away for this?

[Message 36] Ben: Going away? Who's going away?

[Message 37] Casey: Just saying... for vehicular homicide and all. If it wasn't an accident.

[Message 38] Alex: Casey, stop it. You're making things weird.

[Message 39] Ben: Yeah, Casey, seriously. Lay off.

[Message 40] Casey: Fine, fine. Just curious.

[Message 41] Alex: So, new bar tomorrow?

[Message 42] Ben: Yeah, definitely. Need a distraction.

[Message 43] Alex: Agreed.

[Message 44] Casey: Y’all have fun.

[Message 52] Alex: What's up?

[Message 53] Ben: Remember how I said I saw Casey buying Car accident (vehicular homicide)?

[Message 54] Alex: Yeah?

[Message 55] Ben: I saw him leave the building at Sunset.

[Message 56] Alex: Okay… and?

[Message 57] Ben: And...I just have a weird feeling.

[Message 58] Alex: Look, I get it, it's strange. But don't go pointing fingers without proof.

[Message 59] Ben: I know, I know. Just needed to vent.

[Message 60] Alex: Understood. Look, let's just try to enjoy tomorrow, okay?

[Message 61] Ben: Yeah, you're right.

[Message 62] Alex: Good.

[Message 63] Casey: So... Did anyone know Sam or Mark well?

[Message 64] Alex: Not really. You?

[Message 65] Casey: Nah. Just trying to understand what happened.

[Message 66] Ben: I think that it may have been an impulsive act of rage.

[Message 67] Alex: What makes you say that, Ben?

[Message 68] Ben: Just a hunch.

[Message 69] Casey: Hunch? Based on what?

[Message 70] Ben: Nothing. Forget I said anything.

[Message 71] Alex: Alright then.

[Message 72] Casey: You guys are acting so weird.

[Message 73] Ben: You're the one acting weird, Casey.

[Message 74] Alex: Come on, guys, let's just drop it.

[Message 75] Casey: Whatever.

[Message 76] Ben: Hey Alex, I had another thought.

[Message 77] Alex: What is it now, Ben?

[Message 78] Ben: About Casey. Remember how he always hated 3.  Taxi Driver?

[Message 79] Alex: Vaguely. What's your point?

[Message 80] Ben: Sam was a taxi driver. Just saying.

[Message 81] Alex: You’re reaching, Ben. Seriously.

[Message 82] Ben: Maybe.

[Message 83] Alex: Let the cops do their job. We're just gonna make things worse.

[Message 84] Ben: Fine.

[Message 85] Casey: I bought a new car today!

[Message 86] Alex: Congrats? Bit insensitive timing, don't you think?

[Message 87] Casey: What's that supposed to mean?

[Message 88] Ben: Yeah, Casey, not cool.

[Message 89] Casey: Just excited, damn!

[Message 90] Alex: Alright, alright. Just be mindful.

[Message 91] Ben: Whatever.

[Message 92] Alex: So, about that bar… 8 PM?

[Message 93] Ben: Sounds good.

[Message 94] Casey: Have fun!

[Message 95] Alex: You sure you don't want to join, Casey? We could use some cheering up.

[Message 96] Casey: I'm good. Thanks, though.

[Message 97] Ben: Suit yourself.

[Message 98] Alex: See you tomorrow, Ben.

[Message 99] Ben: Later.

[Message 100] Casey: Bye.

[Message 101] Alex: Ben, listen. I need to tell you something privately tomorrow at the bar.

[Message 102] Ben: Okay. What is it?

[Message 103] Alex: It's about Casey. And something I saw.

[Message 104] Ben: Now you're starting to worry me. Just text me.

[Message 105] Alex: I saw Casey looking up how to make Car accident (vehicular homicide) online last week.

[Message 106] Ben: Holy shit. Are you serious?

[Message 107] Alex: Dead serious.

[Message 108] Ben: We need to tell the cops.

[Message 109] Alex: Not yet. Let's talk face to face first. There's more.

[Message 110] Ben: Okay. See you tomorrow. I'm freaked out.

[Message 111] Alex: Me too. Just try to stay calm.

[Message 112] Ben: Will do.

[Message 113] Casey: Did you guys hear the cops are looking for a witness elimination?

[Message 114] Alex: Yeah, I heard.

[Message 115] Ben: Why do you ask, Casey?

[Message 116] Casey: Just curious. Scary stuff.

[Message 117] Alex: Agreed.

[Message 118] Ben: Very scary.

[Message 119] Casey: Hope they catch him.

[Message 120] Alex: Me too.

[Message 121] Ben: Definitely.

[Message 122] Alex: Ben, I'm thinking of bailing on the bar tonight. I'm really not feeling it.

[Message 123] Ben: What? Why? You said you had something to tell me.

[Message 124] Alex: I know, but I think I need to process everything first. It's a lot to take in.

[Message 125] Ben: You can't just leave me hanging like this, Alex. This is important.

[Message 126] Alex: I know, I know. But I need time.

[Message 127] Ben: Fine. But you better call me tomorrow.

[Message 128] Alex: I will. I promise.

[Message 129] Ben: Okay.

[Message 130] Casey: Everything alright, guys? You seem tense.

[Message 131] Alex: Just a bit tired, Casey. That's all.

[Message 132] Ben: Yeah, nothing to worry about.

[Message 133] Casey: Okay. Just checking.

[Message 134] Alex: Thanks.

[Message 135] Ben: Sure.

[Message 136] Casey: Well, I'm going to bed. Night, guys.

[Message 137] Alex: Night.

[Message 138] Ben: Night.

[Message 139] Alex: Ben, it's about the taxi driver, Sam. I overheard him talking about hurting her right before he went over there.

[Message 140] Ben: Who?

[Message 141] Alex: Casey. Sam overheard him talking about getting rid of him.

[Message 142] Ben: You're saying Sam knew Casey intended to hurt Mark?

[Message 143] Alex: That's what it sounded like. Sam looked nervous, like he knew too much.

[Message 144] Ben: This changes everything. This is not mercy killing due to severe suffering. This is murder. Casey knew.

[Message 145] Alex: I'm scared, Ben. What if he finds out I know?

[Message 146] Ben: We have to go to the police, Alex. Now.

[Message 147] Alex: Okay, okay. I'll call them.

[Message 148] Ben: Good. I'll meet you there.

[Message 149] Alex: Okay. See you soon.

[Message 156] Alex: I hope so.

[Message 157] Casey: What's going on? Why aren't you answering me?

[Message 158] Alex: It's over, Casey.

[Message 159] Ben: They know everything.

[Message 160] Casey: What are you talking about? What do they know?

[Message 161] Alex: About Sam. And Mark. And what you did.

[Message 162] Ben: I didn't do anything.

[Message 163] Alex: You were talking about getting rid of him before.

[Message 164] Casey: Who?

[Message 165] Ben: Mark

[Message 166] Alex: They know you killed Sam because he knew your plan to get rid of Mark.

[Message 167] Casey: What plan? I had no plan. This is all a mistake.

[Message 168] Alex: The cops are here, Casey.

[Message 169] Ben: It's over.

[Message 170] Casey: Wait!

...","Here's a 125-message conversation reflecting the scenario, characters, and requirements you've outlined:

[Message 1] Maya: ""Anyone know why the Convention Center is closed?""
[Message 2] Chloe: ""No clue. Traffic was a nightmare this morning, though.""
[Message 3] Liam: ""Heard there was some kinda incident.""
[Message 4] Maya: ""Incident? Like what?""
[Message 5] Chloe: ""Probably just a burst pipe or something.""
[Message 6] Liam: ""Nah, my cousin works security nearby. Said it was serious.""
[Message 7] Maya: ""Serious how?""
[Message 8] Liam: ""He wouldn't say. But he mentioned 'evidence.'""
[Message 9] Chloe: ""Evidence of what? Bad catering?""
[Message 10] Maya: ""Chloe, you're impossible. Someone probably just tripped and fell.""
[Message 11] Liam: ""Heard someone say that 7.  Activist named Anya and the night guard...River were found dead. ""
[Message 12] Chloe: ""WHAT?! Anya and River? Seriously? ""
[Message 13] Maya: ""Oh my god, that's terrible!""
[Message 14] Liam: ""Yeah, pretty messed up. ""
[Message 15] Chloe: ""I knew Anya from the protests. She was...intense.""
[Message 16] Maya: ""Intense but harmless. River was just trying to make a living.""
[Message 17] Liam: ""My cousin mentioned something about a golf club.""
[Message 18] Chloe: ""A golf club? That's random.""
[Message 19] Maya: ""Maybe someone was playing golf inside? Stupid, but...""
[Message 20] Liam: ""Doubt it. He was being super vague.""
[Message 21] Chloe: ""I saw Anya arguing with someone a few days ago outside City Hall. Looked heated.""
[Message 22] Maya: ""Who was she arguing with?""
[Message 23] Chloe: ""Couldn't see. Just some woman.""
[Message 24] Liam: ""Maybe that woman had a motive. Anya ruffled a lot of feathers.""
[Message 25] Maya: ""Yeah, especially with that developer she kept protesting.""
[Message 26] Chloe: ""True. She was relentless.""
[Message 27] Liam: ""Did either of you know River well?""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Just in passing. Seemed like a good kid.""
[Message 29] Chloe: ""Same. Always sketching in their notebook.""
[Message 30] Liam: ""Okay, just curious.""
[Message 31] Maya: ""So, what now? Police investigation, right?""
[Message 32] Chloe: ""Obviously. This is a huge deal.""
[Message 33] Liam: ""Hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 34] Maya: ""Me too. It's horrifying.""
[Message 35] Chloe: ""Guys, I gotta run. Grocery shopping.""
[Message 36] Liam: ""Alright, see ya.""
[Message 37] Maya: ""Later.""
[Message 38] Chloe: ""Hey, Maya, before I go - do you remember seeing anything weird around the convention center lately?""
[Message 39] Maya: ""Weird how?""
[Message 40] Chloe: ""Like... anyone acting suspicious. Or just out of place?""
[Message 41] Maya: ""Not really. Why?""
[Message 42] Chloe: ""Just a feeling. Never mind. Bye.""
[Message 43] Maya: ""Okay... bye.""
[Message 44] Liam: ""That was a weird question from Chloe.""
[Message 45] Maya: ""Tell me about it. Makes you wonder.""
[Message 46] Liam: ""Wonder what?""
[Message 47] Maya: ""I don't know... if she knows something she's not saying.""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Could be. She knew Anya better than we did.""
[Message 49] Maya: ""True. And that argument she mentioned...""
[Message 50] Liam: ""Yeah. Maybe she saw who Anya was arguing with.""
[Message 51] Maya: ""We should probably just let the police handle it.""
[Message 52] Liam: ""Probably. But something feels off.""
[Message 53] Maya: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Just... the golf club thing. It's so specific.""
[Message 55] Maya: ""Maybe it was a crime of passion? Someone snapped?""
[Message 56] Liam: ""Maybe. Or someone intended this all along.""
[Message 57] Chloe: ""Back from the store. Ugh, so many people out today.""
[Message 58] Maya: ""Hey, Chloe. You okay?""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""Yeah, why wouldn't I be?""
[Message 60] Liam: ""You seemed a little on edge earlier.""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""Just stressed. This whole thing is awful.""
[Message 62] Maya: ""Did you remember who Anya was arguing with?""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""No, like I said, I couldn't see their face.""
[Message 64] Liam: ""Did you see what they were wearing, any details?""
[Message 65] Chloe: ""Just a dark coat. It was getting dark out.""
[Message 66] Maya: ""Anything else?""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""No, that's it. I had to catch the bus.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""Okay.""
[Message 69] Maya: ""Alright.""
[Message 70] Chloe: ""I'm making lasagna, anyone want to come over later?""
[Message 71] Maya: ""Sounds good, maybe.""
[Message 72] Liam: ""I'm in.""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Great! 7 pm?""
[Message 74] Maya: ""Perfect.""
[Message 75] Liam: ""See you then.""
[Message 76] Maya: ""Liam, you still there?""
[Message 77] Liam: ""Yep.""
[Message 78] Maya: ""Something is REALLY bugging me about Chloe.""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Yeah, me too. She's acting weird.""
[Message 80] Maya: ""The way she asked about seeing anything strange...""
[Message 81] Liam: ""And how she conveniently couldn't see the person Anya was arguing with.""
[Message 82] Maya: ""Exactly! It's like she's hiding something.""
[Message 83] Liam: ""Or trying to lead us in the wrong direction.""
[Message 84] Maya: ""Maybe she was buying Hitting with a golf club at the store and wanted to see if we suspect anything?""
[Message 85] Liam: ""That’s a reach, but I will keep it in mind, since that's the murder weapon.""
[Message 86] Maya: ""We should subtly try to find out more tonight.""
[Message 87] Liam: ""Agreed. Play it cool, though.""
[Message 88] Maya: ""Definitely. Don't want to spook her if she is innocent.""
[Message 89] Liam: ""Right. See you at Chloe's.""
[Message 90] Maya: ""See ya.""
[Message 91] Chloe: ""Hey, I'm just putting the lasagna in the oven. Should be ready around 7:15!""
[Message 92] Liam: ""Sounds delicious!""
[Message 93] Maya: ""Can't wait!""
[Message 94] Chloe: ""Oh, and I almost forgot - I found this old golf club in my garage. Anyone want it? I'm just going to donate it.""
[Message 95] Maya: ""A golf club? That's... interesting timing.""
[Message 96] Liam: ""Yeah, a little strange, Chloe.""
[Message 97] Chloe: ""What do you mean? It's just been sitting there for ages. I’m trying to declutter.""
[Message 98] Maya: ""No reason. Just... you know, with everything that happened.""
[Message 99] Chloe: ""Okay... well, let me know if you want it before I take it to Goodwill.""
[Message 100] Liam: ""We'll see. Thanks.""
[Message 101] Maya: ""Maybe someone she knows wanted to get rid of Anya? Who knows.""
[Message 102] Liam: ""Alright, I'm heading over to Chloe's now. Wish me luck.""
[Message 103] Maya: ""Good luck. Be careful.""
[Message 104] Liam: ""Always am.""
[Message 105] Chloe: ""Liam, almost here! I saw him leave the building at Midnight last night.""
[Message 106] Liam: ""Just parked. Be right up.""
[Message 107] Chloe: ""Great! Oh, and I forgot to mention – I saw some of Anya’s activist friends outside River’s apartment last week. They looked angry.""
[Message 108] Liam: ""Interesting... see you in a sec.""
[Message 109] Maya: ""Okay, I'm officially freaked out. Both of them are acting sus.""
[Message 110] Maya: ""Liam, any updates? Is everything okay?""
[Message 111] Liam: ""Lasagna's good. Conversation... tense.""
[Message 112] Maya: ""Tense how?""
[Message 113] Liam: ""Chloe keeps bringing up Anya's enemies. But seems like she's acting like she has something to hide. Maybe she saw Anya arguing with someone? Or that Anya ruffled a lot of feathers and she was one of them.""
[Message 114] Maya: ""And the golf club? What did you say?""
[Message 115] Liam: ""Just played it cool. Said we'd think about it.""
[Message 116] Maya: ""Good. Keep me posted.""
[Message 117] Liam: ""Will do.""
[Message 118] Chloe: ""Hey Maya, Liam is in the restroom. It's just you and I. Was wondering your thoughts, cause I know how close you were to Anya and River.""
[Message 119] Maya: ""Close? I knew them, but not *close* close. What's up?""
[Message 120] Chloe: ""Well, the whole thing is just so crazy. River always sketched in their notebook. It's just... a terrible thing for any of us to experience, let alone them.""
[Message 121] Maya: ""Yeah, awful.""
[Message 122] Chloe: ""You don't think Liam could be involved, do you? He's always been a bit...off.""
[Message 123] Maya: ""Liam? No way. He's just awkward. Why would you think that?""
[Message 124] Chloe: ""I don't know... He's been asking a lot of questions. And he knew Anya ruffled a lot of feathers before they got there.""
[Message 125] Maya: ""Okay, now you're just reaching. You are making me nervous, Chloe. I have to go.""

[Message 3] MAYA: I know! Two people, right? So awful.
[Message 4] CHLOE: Yeah, two bartenders. Marco and Sofia, I heard.
[Message 5] LIAM: Marco? I knew Marco! He was always so carefree.
[Message 6] MAYA: Sofia too! She always had a smile.
[Message 7] DAVID: Yeah, terrible. I was actually there earlier that evening.
[Message 8] CHLOE: Really, David? Did you see anything strange?
[Message 9] DAVID: Nah, nothing out of the ordinary. Just the usual crowd.
[Message 10] LIAM: Crazy how things can change so fast.
[Message 11] MAYA: Agreed. Makes you think.
[Message 12] CHLOE: Seriously! Anyway, you guys watching that new show tonight?
[Message 13] LIAM: Maybe. Depends if I can sleep. This whole thing is giving me the creeps.
[Message 14] MAYA: I know, right? I might just stay in and read.
[Message 15] DAVID: I need to catch up on some work. This is such a distraction.

[Message 22] MAYA: Okay. Just checking.
[Message 23] LIAM: Hey Maya, you know David well, right?
[Message 24] MAYA: Yeah, we've known each other for a while. Why?
[Message 25] LIAM: Just wondering if he’s been acting weird lately.
[Message 26] MAYA: He's been stressed about work, that's all.
[Message 27] LIAM: Right, work.
[Message 28] CHLOE: GUYS! They said they found an ice pick!
[Message 29] LIAM: An ice pick? Seriously?
[Message 30] MAYA: That's so specific and disturbing.
[Message 31] DAVID: Wow. That's…intense.
[Message 32] CHLOE: I know! Who even owns an ice pick these days?
[Message 33] LIAM: Maybe someone who works with ice sculptures?
[Message 34] MAYA: Good point, Liam.
[Message 35] DAVID: Let's not jump to conclusions. The police will figure it out.
[Message 36] CHLOE: I hope so. I'm locking my doors tonight.
[Message 37] LIAM: Me too. Stay safe, everyone.
[Message 38] MAYA: You too.
[Message 39] DAVID: Good night.

[Message 43] MAYA: Not that I recall. Why?
[Message 44] LIAM: Just curious. He seemed a little…avoidant.
[Message 45] MAYA: He's always avoidant when things get intense. It’s just him.
[Message 46] LIAM: Maybe.

[Message 57] MAYA: Guys, come on.
[Message 58] DAVID: What's that supposed to mean?
[Message 59] LIAM: Nothing, nothing. Just saying.
[Message 60] CHLOE: Okay, let's all just take a deep breath.
[Message 61] MAYA: Agreed.
[Message 62] DAVID: Fine.
[Message 63] LIAM: So, anyone got any plans for the weekend? Trying to change the subject.
[Message 64] CHLOE: Thinking of going to the beach. Need some sunshine.
[Message 65] MAYA: Sounds nice. I might just chill at home.
[Message 66] DAVID: I have some errands to run.

[Message 68] LIAM: You too.
[Message 69] MAYA: Bye!
[Message 70] DAVID: Later.
[Message 71] MAYA: Liam, you still suspicious of David?
[Message 72] LIAM: I don't know, Maya. Something feels off. He always hated bartenders. **(Mens Rea)**
[Message 73] MAYA: But that doesn't mean he'd kill them!
[Message 74] LIAM: True. But still…
[Message 75] CHLOE: Hey guys, just saw something weird.
[Message 76] LIAM: What is it?
[Message 77] MAYA: Tell us!
[Message 78] CHLOE: I saw Jamie, Marco's ex, buying an ice pick at the hardware store yesterday afternoon.
[Message 79] LIAM: Jamie? No way!
[Message 80] MAYA: Seriously? That's…that's really bad.
[Message 81] DAVID: Wow.
[Message 82] CHLOE: I know, right? I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now…
[Message 83] LIAM: Did you see her actually buy it?
[Message 84] CHLOE: Yeah, I saw her pay for it and leave.
[Message 85] MAYA: We need to tell the police!
[Message 86] DAVID: Hold on. Let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe she needed it for something else.
[Message 87] CHLOE: Like what, David?
[Message 88] LIAM: Yeah, what other reason would she have?
[Message 89] DAVID: I don't know! Maybe she's making an ice sculpture!
[Message 90] MAYA: That's a bit of a stretch, David.
[Message 91] CHLOE: Agreed. I'm calling the police.
[Message 92] LIAM: Good call.
[Message 93] MAYA: Let us know what they say.
[Message 94] DAVID: This is getting out of hand.
[Message 95] CHLOE: I just told them about Jamie. They said they'll look into it.
[Message 96] LIAM: Good.
[Message 97] MAYA: Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 98] DAVID: I still think we're making a mistake.
[Message 99] CHLOE: How can reporting a potential lead be a mistake, David?
[Message 100] LIAM: Exactly!
[Message 101] MAYA: He's probably just trying to be fair, guys.
[Message 102] DAVID: Thank you, Maya.
[Message 103] CHLOE: Whatever. I just hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 104] LIAM: Me too.
[Message 105] MAYA: Agreed.
[Message 106] DAVID: Of course.
[Message 107] LIAM: Maya, can I ask you something personal?
[Message 108] MAYA: Sure, what's up?
[Message 109] LIAM: Do you think David is capable of something like that?
[Message 110] MAYA: I honestly don't know, Liam. I want to believe he's not, but…
[Message 111] LIAM: But what?
[Message 112] MAYA: He has a temper. He was fired last month for yelling at his boss.
[Message 113] LIAM: Yelling? That's it?
[Message 114] MAYA: No, he was also complaining about how he was gonna get rid of the manager. **(Mens Rea)**
[Message 115] LIAM: Wow.
[Message 116] CHLOE: Hey guys, police questioned Jamie. She said she bought the ice pick for a friend who's a sculptor.
[Message 117] LIAM: Sculptor, huh?
[Message 118] MAYA: Seems legit.
[Message 119] DAVID: See? I told you.
[Message 120] CHLOE: Yeah, but they're still investigating.
[Message 121] LIAM: Good.
[Message 122] MAYA: So, back to square one.
[Message 123] DAVID: Not necessarily. They have other leads, I'm sure.
[Message 124] CHLOE: I hope so.
[Message 125] LIAM: Me too.
[Message 126] MAYA: This is so draining.
[Message 127] DAVID: I agree.
[Message 128] CHLOE: Guys, I just remembered something. I saw David leaving Fairground that night. **(Actus Reus)**
[Message 129] LIAM: You did? When?
[Message 130] MAYA: Chloe, are you sure?
[Message 131] CHLOE: Yeah, it was late. Like, almost Late Evening.
[Message 132] LIAM: David, care to explain?
[Message 133] DAVID: I told you, I was there earlier. I left around 8 PM.
[Message 134] CHLOE: No, David. It was later. I remember seeing you walk out, looking really angry.
[Message 135] LIAM: Angry about what, David?
[Message 136] MAYA: David, please just tell us the truth.
[Message 137] DAVID: I already told you the truth! I left early! This is ridiculous!
[Message 138] CHLOE: I don't believe you.
[Message 139] LIAM: Me neither.
[Message 140] MAYA: David, if you know something, please tell us. It's important.
[Message 141] DAVID: I swear, I don't know anything! You guys are accusing me of murder! Do you know they are going away for a long time for this **(Punishment)**
[Message 142] CHLOE: Then why were you there so late?
[Message 143] LIAM: Yeah, why were you so angry?
[Message 144] MAYA: David, please.
[Message 145] DAVID: Fine! I was upset because Marco was hitting on me. I told him to stop, and I left. That's it!
[Message 146] CHLOE: Hitting on you?
[Message 147] LIAM: And you just left?
[Message 148] MAYA: Okay, that makes more sense.
[Message 149] DAVID: Yes! That's all that happened!
[Message 150] CHLOE: Okay, I guess that could be true.
[Message 151] LIAM: Still seems suspicious.
[Message 152] MAYA: Liam, give it a rest.
[Message 153] CHLOE: Yeah, Liam. Let's just let the police do their job.
[Message 154] LIAM: Fine.
[Message 155] DAVID: Thank you, Chloe.
[Message 156] CHLOE: But David, you should have told us that earlier.
[Message 157] LIAM: Yeah, that would have saved us a lot of trouble.
[Message 158] MAYA: True.
[Message 159] DAVID: I was embarrassed, okay?
[Message 160] CHLOE: Okay, well, just be honest with us in the future.
[Message 161] LIAM: Agreed.
[Message 162] MAYA: Yes, please.
[Message 163] DAVID: I will. I promise.
[Message 164] CHLOE: Okay, well, I'm going to try and get some sleep.
[Message 165] LIAM: Me too.
[Message 166] MAYA: Good night, everyone.
[Message 167] DAVID: Good night.
[Message 168] LIAM: Hey Maya, one more thing. After the victim got hurt, i saw David refuse to call 911, he said they deserved it. **(Causation)**
[Message 169] MAYA: Seriously? This is bad...
[Message 170] LIAM: Yeah, he really seemed to have something against them.
[Message 171] MAYA: That's horrible, we should report him
[Message 172] LIAM: Agreed. I'm doing it first thing in the morning.
[Message 173] MAYA: Ok.
[Message 174] CHLOE: Guys, anything new?
[Message 175] LIAM: Nothing yet, Chloe.
[Message 176] MAYA: Just waiting to hear back from the police.
[Message 177] CHLOE: Fingers crossed.
[Message 178] LIAM: I hope they find the killer soon. Sofia didn't deserve this.
[Message 179] MAYA: Nobody did.
[Message 180] CHLOE: Agreed.

[Message 3] Jordan: ""Guys, terrible news about David. I'm so shocked. Did they say anything about a suspect?""
[Message 4] Kai: ""Not that I've heard, Jordan. Just 'ongoing investigation'. It happened at Evening, so there weren't many witnesses, I guess.""
[Message 5] Jordan: ""I saw Liam leave the Bank at Evening. I remember thinking he looked stressed. You okay, Liam?""
[Message 6] Liam: ""Woah, Jordan, back off. I was just closing up. I work there, remember? I'm always stressed. The manager was being a pain that day.""
[Message 7] Kai: ""Calm down, Liam. Jordan's just asking. You know, everyone's on edge.""
[Message 8] Liam: ""Easy for you to say, Kai. You weren't practically living at Bank. David never liked me much, always riding my back.""
[Message 9] Kai: ""Maybe he was trying to help you improve? Anyway, I am worried the cops will think that I was involved.""
[Message 10] Jordan: ""Anyone know why someone would want to hurt David? He was always so creative. He said the world was a stage, and everyone must play the part God wants. Did he have enemies?""
[Message 11] Liam: ""Enemies? Maybe just disgruntled customers, I don't know. People get crazy about money. One guy was ranting about Poisoning via inhalation him last week, but I didn't take him seriously.""
[Message 12] Kai: ""Poisoning via inhalation? That sounds… intense. I heard it might've been something like that.""
[Message 13] Jordan: ""Liam, you knew about the Poisoning via inhalation? That wasn't public knowledge. Seems like you knew about it beforehand.""
[Message 14] Liam: ""I didn't *know*, Jordan. I just overheard someone say something, okay? It was a rumor. Don't twist my words. All the customers were talking about it.""
[Message 15] Kai: ""Guys, this is getting us nowhere. Let's just cooperate with the police and hope they catch whoever did this. I have to go.""
[Message 16] Jordan: ""Kai, you seemed close to David. Did you notice anything off about him lately? He seemed like he was at risk, not long for this world.""
[Message 17] Kai: ""He was a social worker. He was always helping people who were down on their luck. It’s possible some people did not like that. But I never intended for this to happen.""
[Message 18] Liam: ""He told me he and some guy were disagreeing over business matters last week. Sounded like a big deal. I thought someone was purposely creating problems for him.""
[Message 19] Jordan: ""Business matters? At a Bank? That's odd. Seems the manager was trying to hide something then.""
[Message 20] Liam: ""Dunno. Just repeating what I heard. Anyway, I'm gonna try and get some sleep. This whole thing is draining.""
[Message 21] Kai: ""Good night, Liam. Jordan, try not to jump to conclusions. We don't want to make things worse. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""Yeah, you're right, Kai. Sorry. It's just…scary. Especially knowing that I saw David minutes before it happened. And that I saw you, Liam.""

...","[Message 1] Kai: OMG, have you guys heard about what happened at the Public Restroom?
[Message 2] Lila: Yeah, it's all over the news. Absolutely horrific. Who were the victims?
[Message 3] River: They're saying it was… Jayden and Alex.
[Message 4] Sasha: Jayden? As in, the Corrections Officer Jayden? I knew him!
[Message 5] Kai: And Alex, the social worker.
[Message 6] Lila: I knew Alex. Worked with them a few times. This is insane.
[Message 7] River: I saw Jayden yesterday. He seemed fine. Maybe a little withdrawn, but nothing out of the ordinary.
[Message 8] Sasha: He always was a bit of a loner.
[Message 9] Kai: This city is getting scarier every day.
[Message 10] Lila: Agreed. Did they say anything about who did it?
[Message 11] River: No names yet, just that they're investigating.
[Message 12] Sasha: They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 13] Kai: I hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 14] Lila: Me too. Justice for Jayden and Alex.
[Message 15] River: Did anyone see anything strange this morning? Anything at all?
[Message 16] Sasha: I was at home all morning. Cleaning.
[Message 17] Kai: I was at work. Nothing out of the ordinary.
[Message 18] Lila: Me too. Just another day at the office.
[Message 19] River: Okay. Just checking.
[Message 20] Sasha: Why River? What’s up?
[Message 21] River: Just… being thorough.
[Message 22] Kai: So, anyone have any theories?
[Message 23] Lila: It could be anyone. A random act of violence?
[Message 24] Sasha: Maybe. Or someone they knew.
[Message 25] River: That's what I'm afraid of.
[Message 26] Kai: Remember how Jayden fired that new girl a few weeks ago? Maybe she snapped.
[Message 27] Lila: You think so? That's a bit of a stretch, Kai.
[Message 28] Sasha: It's possible. People do crazy things.
[Message 29] River: Let's not jump to conclusions. The police will figure it out.
[Message 30] Kai: True. But it's hard not to speculate.
[Message 31] Lila: I have to agree, my mind keeps running.
[Message 32] Sasha: Anyone wants to meet up later for coffee? I need to get out of the house.
[Message 33] Kai: I’m down.
[Message 34] River: Can't. Got a thing.
[Message 35] Lila: I can. Where and when?
[Message 36] Sasha: The usual place at 6?
[Message 37] Lila: Sounds good.
[Message 38] Kai: Cool, see you both there.
[Message 39] River: Alright. Let me know if anything comes up.
[Message 40] Sasha: Will do. Stay safe, River.
[Message 41] River: You too, Sasha. You too, Kai. You too, Lila.
[Message 42] Kai: Later.
[Message 43] Lila: Bye.
[Message 44] Sasha: Bye all.
[Message 45] River: (To self) ""Stay safe""? If only they knew.
[Message 46] Kai: So, coffee was good. But I'm still thinking about Jayden and Alex.
[Message 47] Lila: Me too. Keeps replaying in my head.
[Message 48] Sasha: It’s horrible. Did River say what ""thing"" they had to do?
[Message 49] Kai: No clue. Just said they were busy.
[Message 50] Lila: Odd. They seemed really preoccupied earlier.
[Message 51] Sasha: I noticed that too. Almost like they knew something.
[Message 52] Kai: Don't go there, Sasha.
[Message 53] Lila: Yeah, let's not start accusing people.
[Message 54] Sasha: I'm not accusing anyone! Just saying, they seemed… off.
[Message 55] Kai: Maybe they were just upset about what happened.
[Message 56] Lila: That's probably it.
[Message 57] Sasha: Could be. I'm just saying, I'm not ruling anything out.
[Message 58] Kai: You're exhausting, you know that?
[Message 59] Lila: Tell me about it.
[Message 60] Sasha: Sorry, I just want justice for Jayden and Alex.
[Message 61] Kai: We all do.
[Message 62] Lila: Agreed.
[Message 63] River: (To self) Justice comes at a price. A price you wouldn't understand. I will be blamed, I am sure.
[Message 64] Kai: I heard Alex was having some problems at work.
[Message 65] Lila: Really? What kind of problems?
[Message 66] Kai: Something about a client threatening them.
[Message 67] Sasha: Wow. That's terrifying.
[Message 68] River: See? Lots of possible angles.
[Message 69] Lila: Yeah, but that doesn't make it any less scary.
[Message 70] Kai: Exactly. People are messed up.
[Message 71] Sasha: Did Alex ever mention who was threatening them?
[Message 72] Lila: Not to me. I just knew they were stressed.
[Message 73] Kai: Maybe that's who did it. The client.
[Message 74] River: Could be. Or maybe it's completely unrelated.
[Message 75] Sasha: We’re going in circles here.
[Message 76] Kai: I think we should wait for the police to tell us something.
[Message 77] Lila: Agreed. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
[Message 78] Sasha: Fine. But I'm still going to be suspicious.
[Message 79] Kai: That's your prerogative.
[Message 80] Lila: Let's just try to stay calm.
[Message 81] River: Easier said than done.
[Message 82] Kai: I'm going to try to get some sleep. This is giving me a headache.
[Message 83] Lila: Me too. Goodnight, guys.
[Message 84] Sasha: Night.
[Message 85] River: Goodnight.
[Message 86] Kai: (Next Day) Any news?
[Message 87] Lila: Nothing yet. Still investigating.
[Message 88] Sasha: I saw a cop car outside River's apartment earlier.
[Message 89] Kai: What? Seriously?
[Message 90] Lila: Are you sure, Sasha?
[Message 91] Sasha: Positive. Parked right out front.
[Message 92] Kai: Maybe they were just in the neighborhood?
[Message 93] Lila: Or maybe they wanted to talk to River?
[Message 94] Sasha: That's what I'm thinking.
[Message 95] Kai: OMG. This is getting crazy.
[Message 96] Lila: Sasha, you need to be careful making accusations like that.
[Message 97] Sasha: I’m not accusing! I’m reporting what I saw.
[Message 98] River: (To self) Sasha saw the cop car? Damn it.
[Message 99] Kai: River, are you there?
[Message 100] Lila: River, everything okay?
[Message 101] Sasha: River?
[Message 102] River: Yeah, I'm here. Sorry, was in the shower.
[Message 103] Kai: Sasha said she saw a cop car outside your apartment.
[Message 104] Lila: Is everything alright?
[Message 105] River: Oh, that. Yeah, they just asked me some questions about Jayden.
[Message 106] Kai: About what?
[Message 107] Lila: What did they want to know?
[Message 108] River: Just general stuff. When I last saw him, if I knew anything.
[Message 109] Sasha: Did they say why they were asking you specifically?
[Message 110] River: No, they didn't. Just routine, I guess.
[Message 111] Kai: That's weird.
[Message 112] Lila: Very weird.
[Message 113] Sasha: Something's not adding up.
[Message 114] River: Look, I told them everything I knew. Which wasn't much.
[Message 115] Kai: Okay. If you say so.
[Message 116] Lila: Yeah, well…
[Message 117] Sasha: Still not buying it.
[Message 118] River: Seriously, guys? You think I had something to do with this?
[Message 119] Kai: Nobody said that, River.
[Message 120] Lila: Exactly. We're just concerned.
[Message 121] Sasha: But you have to admit, it looks suspicious.
[Message 122] River: Suspicious how? I barely knew Jayden!
[Message 123] Kai: Okay, let's all just take a breath.
[Message 124] Lila: Agreed. This is getting out of hand.
[Message 125] Sasha: Fine. I'll drop it. For now.
[Message 126] River: Thank you.
[Message 127] Kai: So, anything else new?
[Message 128] Lila: Not that I've heard.
[Message 129] Sasha: My cousin works at the courthouse. I'll see if she knows anything.
[Message 130] Kai: Be careful, Sasha. You don't want to get involved.
[Message 131] Lila: Yeah, that could be dangerous.
[Message 132] Sasha: I can handle myself.
[Message 133] River: Please don't do anything stupid.
[Message 134] Kai: Seriously, Sasha. Just let the police do their job.
[Message 135] Lila: Agreed.
[Message 136] Sasha: Whatever. I'm just trying to help.
[Message 137] River: ""Help""? Or make things worse?
[Message 138] Kai: Guys, stop it!
[Message 139] Lila: Seriously, enough!
[Message 140] Sasha: Fine. I'm done.
[Message 141] River: Good.
[Message 142] Kai: This is exactly what I was afraid of.
[Message 143] Lila: Me too. We need to stay calm and let the authorities handle it.
[Message 144] Sasha: Okay, okay. I get it.
[Message 145] River: (To Self) They’re closer than they think. Alex knew something about my dealings, and Jayden knew about Alex. That's what this was about. I knew I had to take care of it; I knew what would happen if I didn't. I acted purposefully.
[Message 146] Kai: Anyone else having trouble sleeping?
[Message 147] Lila: Horrible. Every time I close my eyes.
[Message 148] Sasha: I keep seeing Jayden's face.
[Message 149] River: Yeah, it's rough.
[Message 150] Kai: It's just so senseless.
[Message 151] Lila: Agreed. Why would anyone do this?
[Message 152] Sasha: I wish I knew.
[Message 153] River: Maybe we'll never know.
[Message 154] Kai: I hope that's not true.
[Message 155] Lila: Me too.
[Message 156] Sasha: Well, I'm going to try to get some rest.
[Message 157] Kai: Goodnight.
[Message 158] Lila: Night.
[Message 159] River: (To Self) Sasha’s silence is deafening. Almost worse than her accusations.
[Message 160] Kai: Has anyone heard from River recently?
[Message 161] Lila: No, not since last night.
[Message 162] Sasha: Me neither. That's odd.
[Message 163] Kai: I'm starting to worry.
[Message 164] Lila: Maybe they just turned off their phone?
[Message 165] Sasha: Maybe. Or maybe the police took them in for questioning.
[Message 166] Kai: Don't say that, Sasha!
[Message 167] Lila: Yeah, let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 168] Sasha: Just a thought. I am starting to wonder if River had anything to do with it.
[Message 169] Kai: River was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 170] Lila: I was not aware of this.
[Message 171] Sasha: The person who fired Jayden may have been mad enough to hire a hitman.
[Message 172] Kai: Lets just calm down and wait for some news.
[Message 173] Lila: Agreed
[Message 174] Sasha: Fine.
[Message 175] River: (To Self) Almost there. Almost free.
[Message 176] Kai: News Alert - River has been arrested in connection with the deaths of Jayden and Alex.
[Message 177] Lila: OMG!
[Message 178] Sasha: I KNEW IT!
[Message 179] Kai: So… it was him.
[Message 180] Lila: I guess so. This is just… unbelievable.

[Message 2] Ben: Seriously, Maya. It's awful. I still can't wrap my head around this...

[Message 3] Chloe: Me neither. So tragic.

[Message 4] Daniel: Yeah, terrible. Hey Ben, you heading to that coffee shop later?

[Message 5] Ben: Maybe, Daniel. Depends. Why?

[Message 6] Daniel: Just wondering. Haven't seen you in ages.

[Message 7] Ben: Been busy. You know how it is.

[Message 8] Chloe: Busy doing what, Ben? Just curious.

[Message 9] Ben: Just, you know, stuff. Work.

[Message 10] Maya: Chloe, let him be. It's a difficult time for everyone. Did any of you guys know Alex well?

[Message 11] Chloe: I knew him, yeah. He was always so passionate about his activism.

[Message 12] Daniel: I’d seen him around. The manager at his work was always complaining about Alex.

[Message 13] Ben: I knew Alex, yeah. We talked about business sometimes. Nothing serious.

[Message 14] Maya: Business? What kind of business?

[Message 15] Ben: Just… freelance stuff. He was helping me with some web design.

[Message 16] Chloe: Web design? I thought he was focused on activism.

[Message 17] Ben: Yeah, that too. He had a lot on his plate.

[Message 18] Daniel: Did you see Alex the other day Ben?

[Message 19] Ben: Last I saw him was maybe a week ago? Why?

[Message 20] Daniel: Just wondering if you heard him mention anything weird.

[Message 21] Ben: Nope. Nothing weird.

[Message 22] Maya: The police are asking a lot of questions, right?

[Message 23] Chloe: I imagine so. A death like that…

[Message 24] Daniel: Wonder if they have any leads.

[Message 25] Ben: Probably not. These things take time.

[Message 26] Maya: So true.

[Message 27] Chloe: It's just so sad. He was only 40.

[Message 28] Daniel: Life is short, huh?

[Message 29] Ben: Tell me about it.

[Message 30] Maya: Makes you think, doesn't it?

[Message 31] Chloe: Totally. Hey, has anyone spoken to Kai lately?

[Message 32] Daniel: Kai? Why?

[Message 33] Chloe: Just haven't heard from him. He was pretty close to Alex.

[Message 34] Ben: Kai’s probably just grieving.

[Message 35] Maya: Yeah, give him some space.

[Message 36] Daniel: Yeah, i agree with Maya

[Message 37] Chloe: True. I just hope he's okay.

[Message 38] Ben: He will be. He's strong.

[Message 39] Maya: Anyone know what time they found him?

[Message 40] Daniel: I think the news said Mid-Morning.

[Message 41] Ben: Ugh, so early.

[Message 42] Chloe: Horrible.

[Message 43] Maya: I hope they catch whoever did this.

[Message 44] Daniel: Me too. They're going away for a long time for this

[Message 45] Ben: Agreed.

[Message 46] Chloe: Absolutely.

[Message 47] Maya: I'm going to try and get some sleep. This is exhausting.

[Message 48] Daniel: Yeah, same here.

[Message 49] Ben: Night, guys.

[Message 50] Chloe: Goodnight.

[Message 51] Maya: Goodnight.

[Message 52] Chloe: Hey Daniel, you still there?

[Message 53] Daniel: Yeah, Chloe?

[Message 54] Chloe: Did Ben seem weird to you?

[Message 55] Daniel: Weird how?

[Message 56] Chloe: Just… evasive. About when he last saw Alex.

[Message 57] Daniel: Maybe he's just shocked. I saw him leave the building at Mid-Morning that day, but I assumed he was just heading out for lunch.

[Message 58] Chloe: Maybe. I just have this feeling…

[Message 59] Daniel: A feeling about what?

[Message 60] Chloe: Never mind. I'm probably overthinking it.

[Message 61] Daniel: Probably. Get some rest.

[Message 62] Chloe: You too.

[Message 63] Ben: Maya, can I ask you something?

[Message 64] Maya: Sure, Ben. What's up?

[Message 65] Ben: Did Alex ever mention having any enemies?

[Message 66] Maya: Enemies? I don't know… he was an activist. He probably ruffled some feathers. Why?

[Message 67] Ben: Just curious. The manager probably hated him.

[Message 68] Maya: Maybe. But enemies? I don't know.

[Message 69] Ben: Okay. Thanks.

[Message 70] Maya: No problem. You okay?

[Message 71] Ben: Yeah, fine. Just… trying to make sense of things.

[Message 72] Maya: I understand.

[Message 73] Daniel: Hey Chloe, did you hear anything else about Alex?

[Message 74] Chloe: No, nothing new. Just the same reports. Why?

[Message 75] Daniel: I was just thinking… Alex was always so…vocal.

[Message 76] Chloe: Yeah?

[Message 77] Daniel: I always thought he’d get hurt one day with his activism.

[Message 78] Chloe: Maybe. But this… this is different.

[Message 79] Daniel: Yeah, it is.

[Message 80] Maya: Has anyone heard anything from the police? Any updates?

[Message 81] Chloe: Not me.

[Message 82] Daniel: Nope.

[Message 83] Ben: Nothing here either.

[Message 84] Maya: So frustrating.

[Message 85] Chloe: It is.

[Message 86] Daniel: Just gotta be patient, I guess.

[Message 87] Ben: Easier said than done.

[Message 88] Maya: True.

[Message 89] Chloe: What are you guys up to today? Trying to distract myself.

[Message 90] Daniel: Just chilling at home.

[Message 91] Ben: Same.

[Message 92] Maya: Laundry. The glamorous life.

[Message 93] Chloe: Haha. I feel you.

[Message 94] Daniel: Anything on TV?

[Message 95] Ben: Nothing good.

[Message 96] Maya: Always.

[Message 97] Chloe: Okay, I'm gonna go for a walk. Need some fresh air.

[Message 98] Daniel: Good idea.

[Message 99] Ben: Be safe.

[Message 100] Maya: Yeah, be careful Chloe.

[Message 101] Chloe: Will do!

[Message 102] Ben: Maya, one more thing about Alex...

[Message 103] Maya: Yes, Ben?

[Message 104] Ben: Did he ever seem...afraid of anyone?

[Message 105] Maya: Afraid? I don't think so. He was pretty fearless. Why all the questions, Ben?

[Message 106] Ben: Just trying to understand. He always hated Alex. It's just suspicious

[Message 107] Maya: Okay...

[Message 108] Daniel: Hey guys, random question. Anyone know how to unclog a bathtub drain?

[Message 109] Chloe: Seriously, Daniel? Now?

[Message 110] Daniel: What? Just asking. It's clogged.

[Message 111] Ben: Plunger. Or Drano.

[Message 112] Maya: Yeah, Drano is good.

[Message 113] Chloe: Okay... moving on.

[Message 114] Daniel: Sorry, just thought I'd ask.

[Message 115] Ben: No problem.

[Message 116] Maya: So, back to Alex…

[Message 117] Chloe: Can we please talk about something else? I'm getting a headache.

[Message 118] Daniel: Agreed.

[Message 119] Ben: Okay. Whatever.

[Message 120] Maya: Fine. Daniel, how’s that drain coming along?

[Message 121] Daniel: Still working on it. This is a tough one.

[Message 122] Chloe: Maybe you should call a plumber.

[Message 123] Daniel: Maybe.

[Message 124] Ben: Try boiling water. Sometimes that works.

[Message 125] Maya: Good idea, Ben.

[Message 126] Daniel: I'll try that. Thanks.

[Message 127] Chloe: Let us know if it works!

[Message 128] Daniel: Will do.

[Message 129] Ben: So, Chloe, how was the walk?

[Message 130] Chloe: Okay. Just thinking a lot.

[Message 131] Ben: About?

[Message 132] Chloe: Life. Alex. Everything.

[Message 133] Ben: Understandable.

[Message 134] Maya: Yeah, it's a lot to process.

[Message 135] Daniel: Boiling water didn't work. Guess I'm calling a plumber.

[Message 136] Chloe: Sorry to hear that!

[Message 137] Ben: Bummer.

[Message 138] Maya: At least you tried.

[Message 139] Daniel: True.

[Message 140] Chloe: I'm going to make some tea. Anyone want some?

[Message 141] Daniel: Thanks, but I'm good.

[Message 142] Ben: I'm okay, thanks.

[Message 143] Maya: Me too.

[Message 144] Chloe: Alright. Talk to you guys later.

...","[Message 1] Kai: Hey everyone, heard about what happened at Courthouse? Absolutely awful.
[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, Kai. Tragic. Poor Dale.
[Message 3] Maya: Unbelievable. Right in broad daylight.
[Message 4] Noah: Any idea what happened? I’m seeing crazy stuff online.
[Message 5] Olivia: They're saying it was Dale, the Social Worker. Strangulation with a rope.
[Message 6] Kai: Unbelievable... Poor Dale always seemed so kind.
[Message 7] Liam: I saw him leave the building at Late Afternoon. looked kinda panicked.
[Message 8] Maya: Who, Dale? That makes no sense.
[Message 9] Noah: Liam, are you sure? That's... significant.
[Message 10] Olivia: Seriously Liam? You saw him? Did you tell the police?
[Message 11] Liam: I did. Just now.
[Message 12] Kai: Good. Hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 13] Maya: Me too. I can't believe someone would do that.
[Message 14] Noah: Anyone know why someone would target Dale?
[Message 15] Olivia: No clue. He was so well-liked.
[Message 16] Kai: Maybe it was a robbery gone wrong?
[Message 17] Liam: Doesn't seem like it. Nothing was taken, apparently.
[Message 18] Maya: Creepy.
[Message 19] Noah: Hey Olivia, how’s that pottery class going?
[Message 20] Olivia: Good! Made a really nice vase today. Distracting, you know?
[Message 21] Kai: Glad to hear you're finding some peace.
[Message 22] Liam: Yeah, this whole thing is messed up.
[Message 23] Maya: Anyone up for grabbing coffee tomorrow? Need to get out of the house.
[Message 24] Noah: I'm in.
[Message 25] Olivia: Me too.
[Message 26] Kai: Count me in as well.
[Message 27] Liam: I can't. Got a doctor's appointment.
[Message 28] Maya: Okay, we'll miss you.
[Message 29] Noah: Speaking of which, anyone know how to fix a leaky faucet?
[Message 30] Olivia: YouTube is your friend, Noah.
[Message 31] Kai: Seriously. Plenty of tutorials.
[Message 32] Liam: I used to be a plumber, actually. Shoulda called me, Noah.
[Message 33] Maya: See? We have experts among us!
[Message 34] Noah: Wish I knew sooner! Thanks, Liam.
[Message 35] Olivia: Back to Dale, though... This whole thing feels surreal.
[Message 36] Kai: It does. He always stood up for what he believed in.
[Message 37] Liam: Yeah, maybe he made some enemies because of that.
[Message 38] Maya: Possible. Some people don't like being challenged.
[Message 39] Noah: True. Hey, I gotta run. Talk tomorrow.
[Message 40] Olivia: Bye Noah!
[Message 41] Kai: Later.
[Message 42] Liam: See ya.
[Message 43] Maya: Bye.
[Message 44] Olivia: This is so sad. Dale, I feel so bad for him.
[Message 45] Kai: He helped so many people.
[Message 46] Liam: They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 47] Maya: They should. It's a terrible crime.
[Message 48] Olivia: Agreed.
[Message 49] Kai: Anyone hear any updates from the police?
[Message 50] Liam: Not yet. They’re probably still investigating.
[Message 51] Maya: Hope they're thorough.
[Message 52] Olivia: Agreed.
[Message 53] Kai: I hope justice is served, whoever it was.
[Message 54] Liam: Me too. It's scary to think something like that can happen so close.
[Message 55] Maya: Makes you wonder about everything.
[Message 56] Olivia: Exactly.
[Message 57] Kai: So, coffee tomorrow still on? Trying to think of something positive.
[Message 58] Liam: Yeah, still good to go! I'm available after 2.
[Message 59] Maya: Perfect. I'll see you all then.
[Message 60] Noah: Sorry, I had to step away. The police are asking me about Dale.
[Message 61] Olivia: Oh wow, what did they want to know?
[Message 62] Kai: Yeah, what were they asking?
[Message 63] Liam: Be careful what you say, Noah.
[Message 64] Maya: Liam, seriously? He's just cooperating.
[Message 65] Noah: Just general stuff. Where I was, if I knew anything... normal procedure.
[Message 66] Olivia: Okay, good.
[Message 67] Kai: I guess so. Still makes you nervous.
[Message 68] Liam: Just saying, lawyers always advise to be cautious.
[Message 69] Maya: We're not suspects, Liam. Relax.
[Message 70] Noah: I know my rights. Thanks, though.
[Message 71] Olivia: This is getting too intense. Let’s change the subject.
[Message 72] Kai: Agreed. Anyone watching that new true crime doc on Netflix?
[Message 73] Liam: Nah, too close to home right now.
[Message 74] Maya: I can’t handle it either.
[Message 75] Noah: Maybe later.
[Message 76] Olivia: Understandable.
[Message 77] Kai: Did anyone even know Dale well? Like beyond just seeing him around?
[Message 78] Liam: I knew him a bit. He helped me out with a housing issue a while back. He seemed like a genuinely good person.
[Message 79] Maya: I didn’t really know him, just saw him around. Always had a smile.
[Message 80] Noah: Same here.
[Message 81] Olivia: I only knew him professionally. He helped a friend of mine navigate some tough stuff.
[Message 82] Kai: He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there
[Message 83] Liam: Wow, Kai, that's a heavy statement to make. What do you mean?
[Message 84] Maya: Yeah, Kai, elaborate?
[Message 85] Noah: That seems important.
[Message 86] Olivia: Kai, please explain. That sounds…implicating.
[Message 87] Kai: Woah, hold on. I didn’t mean it like that. Just saying, he was frustrated about a case he was working on. Misspoke.
[Message 88] Liam: Okay, just checking. Freaked me out.
[Message 89] Maya: Me too. Be careful what you say, Kai.
[Message 90] Noah: For real.
[Message 91] Olivia: Seriously.
[Message 92] Kai: My bad, guys. Didn’t mean to cause a panic.
[Message 93] Liam: No worries. Just on edge, I guess.
[Message 94] Maya: We all are.
[Message 95] Noah: So, coffee still happening? Need some normalcy.
[Message 96] Olivia: Definitely. I need to get out of this house.
[Message 97] Kai: Yeah, same.
[Message 98] Liam: Still on for me too, as long as nothing comes up.
[Message 99] Maya: Great. Let's just try to relax and not talk about this whole thing the entire time.
[Message 100] Noah: Sounds good.
[Message 101] Olivia: Agreed.
[Message 102] Kai: Deal.
[Message 103] Liam: We should all be there, except Dale of course.
[Message 104] Maya: Lets not talk about Dale, Liam.
[Message 105] Noah: Let us enjoy time together, Liam.
[Message 106] Olivia: Hey guys, I am done.
[Message 107] Kai: What is wrong Olivia?
[Message 108] Liam: Dont worry. I saw Olivia buying Strangulation with a rope at the store.
[Message 109] Maya: Thats not nice Liam.
[Message 110] Noah: Guys, can we stop it?
[Message 111] Olivia: Leave it Kai.
[Message 112] Kai: Ok.
[Message 113] Liam: I think Dale deserved this
[Message 114] Maya: Liam you cant be serious!
[Message 115] Noah: Shut up Liam!
[Message 116] Olivia: I think you are crossing the line Liam.
[Message 117] Kai: Liam seriously, what is wrong with you?
[Message 118] Liam: Someone needed to do it. He was going to expose what happened at the courthouse.
[Message 119] Maya: You are a mess Liam.
[Message 120] Noah: I am calling the cops!

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, Chloe, just tired. Long week at work.
[Message 3] CHLOE: Understandable. Wanna grab coffee later? My treat.
[Message 4] LIAM: Maybe later. Gotta run errands.
[Message 5] CHLOE: Sure thing.
[Message 6] ANNA: Did you hear about what happened at the mall? Awful!
[Message 7] CHLOE: Yeah, Anna, it's all over the news. The security guard, Jamie. So sad.
[Message 8] ANNA: I know! I saw Jamie yesterday afternoon too.
[Message 9] ANNA: Who would do something like that?
[Message 10] CHLOE: I have no idea. It’s scary.
[Message 11] LIAM: Crazy world we live in.
[Message 12] MARK: Heard Jamie was found in a bathtub? Brutal.
[Message 13] ANNA: Where did you hear that, Mark?
[Message 14] MARK: News report, Anna. Online.
[Message 15] CHLOE: I saw Liam leaving the mall around afternoon.
[Message 16] MARK: Yeah, I saw Liam at the food court. He looked angry.
[Message 17] LIAM: I was frustrated, Mark. The cashier messed up my order.
[Message 18] CHLOE: Messed up order or something else, Liam?
[Message 19] LIAM: Chloe, seriously? Don't start.
[Message 20] ANNA: Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. This is a tragedy.
[Message 21] MARK: True, true. But Liam *did* seem extra on edge lately. He always hated Jamie.
[Message 22] LIAM: I didn't hate Jamie, Mark. We just had different opinions sometimes.
[Message 23] CHLOE: Different opinions, or a full-blown rivalry?
[Message 24] LIAM: Chloe, stop.
[Message 25] ANNA: Okay, everyone calm down.
[Message 26] MARK: I heard Jamie was trying to get Liam fired.
[Message 27] CHLOE: I also heard that, Mark.
[Message 28] LIAM: That's a lie!
[Message 29] ANNA: Maybe the police will figure it out soon.
[Message 30] MARK: Hope they catch the person responsible. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 31] CHLOE: Agreed. Justice for Jamie.
[Message 32] LIAM: Of course.
[Message 33] ANNA: Anyone know if Jamie had family in town?
[Message 34] MARK: I think they mentioned a sibling on the news.
[Message 35] CHLOE: Poor Jamie.
[Message 36] LIAM: It's awful what happened.
[Message 37] ANNA: I'm heading home. This conversation is making me anxious.
[Message 38] MARK: Later, Anna.
[Message 39] CHLOE: See ya, Anna.
[Message 40] LIAM: Bye.
[Message 41] CHLOE: Liam, what were you really doing yesterday afternoon?
[Message 42] LIAM: I told you, errands.
[Message 43] CHLOE: What errands? Be specific.
[Message 44] LIAM: Does it matter? The police will figure it out.
[Message 45] CHLOE: It matters to me, Liam.
[Message 46] MARK: Chloe, are you suspicious of Liam?
[Message 47] CHLOE: I'm just asking questions, Mark.
[Message 48] LIAM: Great. More accusations.
[Message 49] ANNA: Maybe we should all just cooperate with the police and let them do their job.
[Message 50] MARK: Smartest thing anyone has said all day, Anna.
[Message 51] CHLOE: I agree, Anna.
[Message 52] LIAM: Fine. Whatever.
[Message 53] CHLOE: Did you see Jamie have an argument with someone earlier?
[Message 54] LIAM: No.
[Message 55] MARK: No idea.
[Message 56] ANNA: I was mostly browsing clothes, didn't notice much.
[Message 57] CHLOE: Hmm. Okay.
[Message 58] LIAM: Seriously, guys. Drop it.
[Message 59] CHLOE: I heard someone say they saw you going to that abandoned storage room near the food court that afternoon, Liam.
[Message 60] LIAM: That's a lie. I was buying shoes at Foot Locker.
[Message 61] CHLOE: Hope you were. I saw Jamie's personal belongings in the dumpster.
[Message 62] LIAM: What does that have to do with me?
[Message 63] MARK: Liam, were you aware that dumping personal belongings like that would have consequences?
[Message 64] LIAM: I didn't do it. I went straight home after getting those shoes. My mom can vouch for me.
[Message 65] CHLOE: If you say so, Liam.

...","[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey, you hear about what happened at the Truck Stop? So crazy!

[Message 2] BEN: Yeah, wild. Two people dead. What a mess.

[Message 3] CHLOE: I know! Poor souls. You know anyone who works there?

[Message 4] BEN: Nah, not really. Heard rumors, though. Bad place, some say.

[Message 5] CHLOE: Rumors? Like what?

[Message 6] BEN: Oh, you know, drugs, fights... shady stuff. Remember that guy, Darren? He used to go there all the time.

[Message 7] CHLOE: Darren? Vaguely. What's he got to do with it?

[Message 8] BEN: Nothing, probably. Just popped into my head. He’s always been a bit…off. Heard he’s into self-defense lately. Taking it pretty seriously.

[Message 9] CHLOE: Self-defense? Weird. Anyway, police will figure it out. You see that new movie yet?

[Message 10] BEN: No, is it any good?

[Message 11] CHLOE: Yeah! Total mind-bender. You should check it out.

[Message 12] BEN: Maybe. Too much on my mind these days. This whole situation is giving me the creeps.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Me too. Especially since I drive through there every morning.

[Message 14] BEN: Early Morning huh? Be careful, Chloe. Seriously.

[Message 15] CHLOE: I will. You too.

[Message 16] LIAM: Hey Ben, you free to grab a coffee later? Need to vent.

[Message 17] BEN: Hey Liam, yeah, maybe. What's up?

[Message 18] LIAM: Just…work stuff. Stressing me out. You know how it is.

[Message 19] BEN: I do. Coffee sounds good. How about 3 PM?

[Message 20] LIAM: Perfect. See you then.

[Message 21] ANNA: Hey Chloe, did you hear about Mark and Sarah?

[Message 22] CHLOE: Yeah, it’s horrible.

[Message 23] ANNA: I can't believe someone would do that. Especially to Sarah, she was such an optimistic person.

[Message 24] CHLOE: I know, right? It's terrifying.

[Message 25] ANNA: I heard Mark, the security guard, was kind of a jerk, though.

[Message 26] CHLOE: Really? How so?

[Message 27] ANNA: Just…cynical, always complaining. Apparently, Darren hated him.

[Message 28] CHLOE: Darren, really? You think he could be involved?

[Message 29] ANNA: I don't know, just saying. People snap, you know?

[Message 30] CHLOE: True. Hope they catch whoever did it.

[Message 31] ANNA: Me too. Hey, you still up for dinner Friday?

[Message 32] CHLOE: Definitely! Need a distraction.

[Message 33] BEN: Liam just left. That was…intense.

[Message 34] CHLOE: Intense how?

[Message 35] BEN: He's really struggling. Said his meds aren't working. Keeps saying the world is a simulation and he needs to ""fix it.""

[Message 36] CHLOE: Whoa. That's… concerning.

[Message 37] BEN: He was asking weird questions about the Truck Stop too. Said he was there early morning the other day.

[Message 38] CHLOE: Doing what?

[Message 39] BEN: He didn’t say. Just kept rambling. Said he saw the security guard, Mark, arguing with someone.

[Message 40] CHLOE: This is getting weirder and weirder. You think he could be involved?

[Message 41] BEN: I hope not, but… I'm worried about him.

[Message 42] CHLOE: Maybe you should talk to someone about this, Ben. The police maybe?

[Message 43] BEN: I don't know... I don't want to get him in trouble if he's just having a bad episode. He was talking about getting rid of him right before he went over there, so I am scared.

[Message 44] CHLOE: Better safe than sorry, right?

[Message 45] BEN: Maybe you're right.

[Message 46] LIAM: Thanks for the coffee, Ben. I feel a bit better.

[Message 47] BEN: Anytime, Liam. You doing okay?

[Message 48] LIAM: Yeah, much better. Just needed to vent. Don't worry about what I said earlier.

[Message 49] BEN: Okay, man. Just looking out for you.

[Message 50] LIAM: Appreciate it. Gotta run.

[Message 51] CHLOE: So, did you say anything to the police?

[Message 52] BEN: Not yet. Still thinking about it. I'm going to see him again tomorrow, maybe I can get him to open up more.

[Message 53] CHLOE: Okay, but be careful, Ben.

[Message 54] BEN: I will. I think he genuinely feels bad about it, like he knows he screwed up.

[Message 55] CHLOE: ""It""? What do you mean ""it""?

[Message 56] BEN: Nothing, nothing. Just… the situation.

[Message 57] CHLOE: Ben, you're scaring me.

[Message 58] BEN: I'm sorry. I just… I don't know what to do.

[Message 59] CHLOE: Tell the truth. To me, to the police, to someone.

[Message 60] BEN: I can’t. Not yet.

[Message 61] ANNA: Heard anything new about the Truck Stop case?

[Message 62] CHLOE: Just rumors. Ben knows Liam, who was supposedly there Early Morning.

[Message 63] ANNA: Interesting. Liam sounds…unstable.

[Message 64] CHLOE: That's what Ben said.

[Message 65] ANNA: Think Ben's involved somehow? Covering for him maybe?

[Message 66] CHLOE: I don't know. He’s acting really weird. Defensiveness really high.

[Message 67] ANNA: Maybe he was buying Stabbing with an ice pick, for Liam.

[Message 68] CHLOE: Whoa, that's a leap. But… it's possible.

[Message 69] ANNA: Everything's possible at this point.

[Message 70] CHLOE: True. Hey, gotta go. Talk later.

[Message 71] BEN: He confessed, Chloe. He said he wanted to end their suffering.

[Message 72] CHLOE: What?! He confessed to what?!

[Message 73] BEN: To… everything. He said he felt like they were trapped.

[Message 74] CHLOE: Trapped? What the hell does that even mean?

[Message 75] BEN: I don't know, Chloe! He’s not making any sense.

[Message 76] CHLOE: Did you call the police?

[Message 77] BEN: Yes, they’re on their way.

[Message 78] CHLOE: You did the right thing, Ben.

[Message 79] BEN: I hope so. I hope they don't get the death penalty for this.

[Message 80] CHLOE: Me too. This is insane.

[Message 81] BEN: He said he felt like it was his purpose. Like he was chosen to do it.

[Message 82] CHLOE: Chosen? Liam is insane!

[Message 83] BEN: I know. I just… I feel so guilty.

[Message 84] CHLOE: Guilty? Why?

[Message 85] BEN: I knew he was struggling. I should have done something sooner. I knew he hated Mark. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.

[Message 86] CHLOE: You can't blame yourself, Ben. This is not your fault.

[Message 87] BEN: Maybe… Maybe you're right.

[Message 88] CHLOE: I am. Just focus on helping the police now.

[Message 89] BEN: Okay. Thanks, Chloe.

[Message 90] CHLOE: Anytime, Ben.

[Message 91] ANNA: Any update on Ben and Liam?

[Message 92] CHLOE: Liam confessed.

[Message 93] ANNA: Wow. Just like that?

[Message 94] CHLOE: Yeah. Ben called the police.

[Message 95] ANNA: So, Ben's in the clear?

[Message 96] CHLOE: I think so. He sounded genuinely shocked.

[Message 97] ANNA: Good. This whole thing was making me sick to my stomach.

[Message 98] CHLOE: Me too. Glad it's (hopefully) over.

[Message 99] ANNA: Hope they find the Stabbing with an ice pick. I heard he was looking up how to make Stabbing with an ice pick online

[Message 100] CHLOE: Yeah. Justice for Mark and Sarah.

[Message 12] MARK: Agreed. Any word on suspects?
[Message 13] ANNA: Not that I've heard. Just rumors.
[Message 14] DAVID: I heard the security cameras were down.
[Message 15] FRANK: That's convenient. Makes you wonder.
[Message 16] CHLOE: Frank, seriously, stop.
[Message 17] MARK: Anyone up for pizza tonight? Distract ourselves from this mess?
[Message 18] ANNA: Sounds good!
[Message 19] DAVID: I'm in.
[Message 20] FRANK: Count me out. Gotta work late.
[Message 21] CHLOE: Okay, see you guys later.
[Message 22] MARK: Later, Chloe.
[Message 23] ANNA: Bye!
[Message 24] DAVID: Peace.
[Message 25] FRANK: Later.
[Message 26] CHLOE: Frank, you okay? You seem on edge.
[Message 27] FRANK: Just tired, Chloe. Long day.
[Message 28] CHLOE: Okay. Just checking.
[Message 29] MARK: Hey Anna, you remember that business proposal David was working on?
[Message 30] ANNA: Vaguely. Why?
[Message 31] MARK: I heard Alex, the security guard, found out something about it. Something shady.
[Message 32] ANNA: Interesting...
[Message 33] DAVID: Guys, anyone know a good lawyer? Hypothetically speaking, of course.
[Message 34] MARK: Hypothetically? Why?
[Message 35] ANNA: Spill, David.
[Message 36] DAVID: Just doing some research for a friend.
[Message 37] FRANK: What kind of research?
[Message 38] DAVID: Just...legal stuff.
[Message 39] CHLOE: Something about lawyers? Getting worried David?
[Message 40] MARK: Yeah, what gives?
[Message 41] DAVID: Guys, I'm at a loss here. How could anyone do this? I knew Alex!
[Message 42] ANNA: Maybe you can go give a statement to the police, David.
[Message 43] DAVID: Maybe I will.
[Message 44] FRANK: Hey Mark, you still have that contact for... getting rid of things?
[Message 45] MARK: What? No! What are you talking about, Frank? That's messed up.
[Message 46] FRANK: Just asking. No need to get defensive.
[Message 47] CHLOE: What things? Getting rid of what things?
[Message 48] MARK: Nothing, Chloe. Just ignore him.
[Message 49] ANNA: Sounds suspicious to me.
[Message 50] DAVID: Frank, that's a terrible thing to say, especially now!
[Message 51] FRANK: Relax, I'm kidding! Bad joke.
[Message 52] CHLOE: Not funny, Frank. Not funny at all.
[Message 53] FRANK: Sorry, okay? Seriously.
[Message 54] MARK: So, about that pizza...
[Message 55] ANNA: Yeah, let's drop this. Pizza time.
[Message 56] DAVID: I could really use a distraction.
[Message 57] CHLOE: Pizza sounds good.
[Message 58] CHLOE: David, do you know Sarah well?
[Message 59] DAVID: Sarah? Not really. Why?
[Message 60] CHLOE: Just wondering.
[Message 61] MARK: Has anyone heard from Sarah since all this happened?
[Message 62] ANNA: Good point, I haven't.
[Message 63] DAVID: Now that you mention it... no.
[Message 64] FRANK: Probably just laying low.
[Message 65] CHLOE: Hope she's okay.
[Message 66] MARK: Me too.
[Message 67] ANNA: Someone should check on her.
[Message 68] DAVID: Maybe later.
[Message 69] FRANK: Guys, I gotta go. Really busy.
[Message 70] CHLOE: Bye, Frank.
[Message 71] MARK: Later.
[Message 72] ANNA: See ya.
[Message 73] DAVID: Later, Frank.
[Message 74] CHLOE: Did you guys see Frank's old car?
[Message 75] MARK: Yeah, what about it?
[Message 76] ANNA: Thought he was getting rid of it.
[Message 77] DAVID: I thought so too. Haven't seen it around lately.
[Message 78] MARK: Guys, this is all too much. Can we change the subject?
[Message 79] CHLOE: Right, sorry.
[Message 80] ANNA: My bad.
[Message 81] DAVID: Agreed.
[Message 82] MARK: Anyone watching the game tonight?
[Message 83] ANNA: Maybe. Depends.
[Message 84] DAVID: I'll probably catch it.
[Message 85] CHLOE: I might.
[Message 86] MARK: Cool.
[Message 87] ANNA: Okay, good talk. I'm gonna go.
[Message 88] DAVID: Later.
[Message 89] CHLOE: Bye.
[Message 90] MARK: Peace.
[Message 91] CHLOE: David, was Sarah angry about her hours being cut? She mentioned it to me.
[Message 92] DAVID: Maybe. It was a tough situation.
[Message 93] MARK: I did notice David fired Sarah, she probably did intend to do something about it.
[Message 94] CHLOE: So, Mark, how was your visit to the ATM last night?
[Message 95] MARK: Chloe, what are you implying? I have an alibi.
[Message 96] ANNA: I bet David knew what was going on. He purposefully didn't help Sarah when she asked for a raise.
[Message 97] DAVID: I'm not feeling good. I won't sleep for days because of this.
[Message 98] CHLOE: You'd go away for a long time, you know that right?
[Message 99] MARK: Guys this whole thing is bad for business, David, you could have just given her the raise.
[Message 100] DAVID: I'm shocked, I would never have thought that one of my old friends killed Alex.
[Message 101] ANNA: Oh so now Alex is your friend?
[Message 102] DAVID: I was friends with him, but he deserved it, he probably knew about the embezzlement.
[Message 103] CHLOE: How did he die anyway?
[Message 104] MARK: I heard that the injection failed, so there were probably other circumstances involved.
[Message 105] ANNA: That means it wasn't a one person job.
[Message 106] DAVID: Now your aware? I thought you wanted to get away with it.
[Message 107] CHLOE: You are trying to pass the blame onto me.
[Message 108] MARK: Chloe do you regret it? You could make this better.
[Message 109] ANNA: You should have called 911, your shouts probably provoked him.
[Message 110] DAVID: It was all a mistake.
[Message 111] CHLOE: I'm going to call the police, you guys are nuts.
[Message 112] MARK: No don't, they will give you the death penalty.
[Message 113] ANNA: I didn't do anything, I didn't even know what you were talking about.
[Message 114] DAVID: Don't lie, I tried to talk you out of it.
[Message 115] CHLOE: I knew that he always hated Alex.
[Message 116] MARK: He was looking up on how to make lethal Administering a lethal injection online.
[Message 117] ANNA: We were just researching, it never happened, its just a coincidence.
[Message 118] DAVID: So you admit there was an attempt?
[Message 119] CHLOE: I think we should all get off the phone now.
[Message 120] MARK: No lets all stick together.
[Message 121] ANNA: Yeah, and then the cops can come and take all of us to jail, sounds like a great idea Mark!
[Message 122] DAVID: This is a bad joke, you guys planned this all along, didn't you!
[Message 123] CHLOE: This is the last time I will ever trust any of you, good bye.
[Message 124] MARK: Good bye Chloe, hope they don't take you away for a long time.
[Message 125] ANNA: Yeah, because you will be there with them!
[Message 126] DAVID: This is the end of our lives.
[Message 127] CHLOE: See you in hell.
[Message 128] MARK: See you there.
[Message 129] ANNA: Good bye.
[Message 130] DAVID: Goodbye.

[Message 56] Kai: Please, Alex. I'm begging you. This could ruin my life. They’re going away for a long time for this.

[Message 2] Kai: Yeah, crazy. Some guy, right? Pushed. What's happening with that new client proposal?
[Message 3] Liam: Yeah, 7.  Activist. Wild. Proposal's almost done. Just need Sarah's input.
[Message 4] Kai: 7.  Activist, huh? I knew the manager there. He was a piece of work. Sarah's always slow, ugh.
[Message 5] Liam: What do you mean about the manager?
[Message 6] Kai: Just, you know, difficult. Demanding. Nothing important. Did you hear anything about who did it?
[Message 7] Liam: Rumor mill's going crazy. Something about a disagreement. Heard it was business related.
[Message 8] Kai: Business? Huh. Sounds boring. I’m at the gym. You going later?
[Message 9] Liam: Maybe. Still processing this whole thing. So sad.
[Message 10] Kai: True. Bad for business for the Ice Cream Shop, too, lol. Okay, gotta run.
[Message 11] Liam: Catch you later.
[Message 12] Chloe: Liam, you online?
[Message 13] Liam: Hey Chloe, what's up?
[Message 14] Chloe: Heard about 7.  Activist. Awful! Poor guy.
[Message 15] Liam: Yeah, shocking. Right in broad daylight.
[Message 16] Chloe: I was there earlier that day! Like, maybe an hour before?
[Message 17] Liam: Seriously? Did you see anything suspicious?
[Message 18] Chloe: No, just the usual. Maybe… I saw Alex leaving the building, but that’s not unusual, right?
[Message 19] Liam: Alex? From accounting? He works near the Ice Cream Shop?
[Message 20] Chloe: Yeah, he always gets ice cream from there. Actus Reus, I suppose - Alex was there.
[Message 21] Liam: Hmmm. Weird.
[Message 22] Chloe: Why weird?
[Message 23] Liam: Just… he mentioned he hated 7.  Activist once. Said he was always causing trouble. Mens Rea, maybe?
[Message 24] Chloe: Oh, wow. I didn’t know that. Okay, now *I'm* freaked out.
[Message 25] Liam: Don't be. Could be nothing.
[Message 26] Chloe: I gotta go, I'm getting nervous now.
[Message 27] Liam: Okay, talk soon.
[Message 28] Kai: Yo, Liam, you still up?
[Message 29] Liam: Yeah, what’s up?
[Message 30] Kai: You won't believe what I just heard.
[Message 31] Liam: What?
[Message 32] Kai: They found video footage.
[Message 33] Liam: Of what?
[Message 34] Kai: Apparently shows someone on the roof of the Ice Cream Shop. Vague, but still.
[Message 35] Liam: Woah. That's crazy. Did they identify anyone?
[Message 36] Kai: Not yet. Just a silhouette.
[Message 37] Liam: That's intense. Concurrence! Connecting intent and action. Scary stuff.
[Message 38] Kai: Yeah, for real. Anyway, wanted to let you know. Night.
[Message 39] Liam: Thanks. Night.
[Message 40] Chloe: Liam! You won't believe what I just remembered.
[Message 41] Liam: What now? My heart can't take much more of this.
[Message 42] Chloe: Alex was looking up Pushing from a height online last week! I saw his search history on his computer screen when he left for lunch. Attempt?
[Message 43] Liam: No way! Are you serious?
[Message 44] Chloe: Dead serious. I thought it was weird at the time, but I didn't think anything of it!
[Message 45] Liam: Okay, this is getting way too suspicious. I think we should tell the police.
[Message 46] Chloe: Are you sure? I don't want to get involved.
[Message 47] Liam: We have to. This is too much to ignore.
[Message 48] Chloe: Okay, okay. Let's go together.
[Message 49] Liam: Good. Meet me in an hour?
[Message 50] Chloe: Deal. I’m scared, Liam.
[Message 51] Liam: Me too.
[Message 52] Kai: Liam, you up for a game tonight?
[Message 53] Liam: Can’t. Something came up.
[Message 54] Kai: Oh, okay. All good. You seemed stressed earlier. Everything alright?
[Message 55] Liam: Yeah, just…stuff.
[Message 56] Kai: Wanna talk about it? I’m a good listener.
[Message 57] Liam: Thanks, but I’m good. Just need to deal with it.
[Message 58] Kai: Alright. Whatever you need. Later.
[Message 59] Liam: Later.
[Message 60] Alex: Hey Liam, you seen Sarah today?
[Message 61] Liam: No, not since yesterday. Why?
[Message 62] Alex: Just need those reports. You know how she is.
[Message 63] Liam: Yeah, I know. I'll let her know you're looking for her.
[Message 64] Alex: Thanks, appreciate it.
[Message 65] Liam: No problem.
[Message 66] Chloe: They’re going away for a long time for this, right? Punishment for harming 7.  Activist.
[Message 67] Liam: That’s what the police were saying. Depending on everything.
[Message 68] Chloe: I feel terrible. I should have said something sooner about Alex.
[Message 69] Liam: Don’t beat yourself up. You didn't know.
[Message 70] Chloe: I keep thinking, what if I had stopped him?
[Message 71] Liam: You couldn’t have known what he intended.
[Message 72] Chloe: I hope I did the right thing.
[Message 73] Liam: You did.
[Message 74] Kai: Liam, you free now? Games?
[Message 75] Liam: Nah, still busy. Sorry.
[Message 76] Kai: You’ve been busy all day. Everything okay? You're acting weird.
[Message 77] Liam: Just… a lot on my mind.
[Message 78] Kai: Okay… Well, if you need anything, let me know. I'm here for you.
[Message 79] Liam: Thanks, Kai.
[Message 80] Alex: Liam, the police just came by my desk and asked me a lot of questions! About the Ice Cream Shop!
[Message 81] Liam: Yeah, they're interviewing everyone who works nearby.
[Message 82] Alex: But they were asking about 7.  Activist, and if I knew him! I barely knew him!
[Message 83] Liam: Just tell them the truth, Alex. You'll be fine.
[Message 84] Alex: But what if they don't believe me? I don't want to get involved in this!
[Message 85] Liam: Just cooperate with them, and you won't have any problems.
[Message 86] Alex: Easy for you to say!
[Message 87] Liam: I’m just saying, don't panic.
[Message 88] Chloe: Liam, did you hear about Alex?
[Message 89] Liam: Yeah, he texted me. Sounds freaked out.
[Message 90] Chloe: I heard he hired a lawyer.
[Message 91] Liam: Seriously? That’s not good.
[Message 92] Chloe: I know, right? Makes him look even more guilty.
[Message 93] Liam: Maybe he’s just scared.
[Message 94] Chloe: Maybe…
[Message 95] Kai: Dude, this Alex thing is wild. You think he did it?
[Message 96] Liam: I don't know what to think.
[Message 97] Kai: I mean, you said he hated 7.  Activist.
[Message 98] Liam: Yeah, but hating someone doesn't make you a murderer.
[Message 99] Kai: True, true. Still, looks bad for him.
[Message 100] Liam: It does.
[Message 101] Alex: Liam, can I talk to you? In person?
[Message 102] Liam: Sure, meet me at the coffee shop in an hour?
[Message 103] Alex: Thanks, I really appreciate it.
[Message 104] Liam: See you then.
[Message 105] Chloe: Be careful, Liam.
[Message 106] Liam: I will.
[Message 107] Chloe: What if he tries to… I don’t even want to think about it.
[Message 108] Liam: He won’t. I'll be fine.
[Message 109] Chloe: Okay… Just please be careful.
[Message 110] Liam: Always.
[Message 111] Kai: Liam, you’re meeting with Alex? Seriously?
[Message 112] Liam: He asked to talk. What am I supposed to do? Say no?
[Message 113] Kai: I don’t know, man. Seems risky. Maybe I should come with you?
[Message 114] Liam: I appreciate it, but I think I need to do this alone.
[Message 115] Kai: Just… be careful, okay? Something about this whole situation feels off.
[Message 116] Liam: It does. I will.
[Message 117] Kai: Let me know how it goes. I'll be waiting to hear from you.
[Message 118] Liam: Will do.
[Message 119] Kai: He probably didn't call 911 right away. Causation! Making the harm worse.
[Message 120] Liam: What? I didn't... What are you implying, Kai?

[Message 24] Ben: Understandable. This is wild.
[Message 25] Anya: True.
[Message 26] Liam: By the way, Ben, I saw you leaving the gym around Early Afternoon yesterday.
[Message 27] Ben: Yeah, I was there. Working out. What time was that exactly?
[Message 28] Liam: Around Early Afternoon. Did you see anything weird?
[Message 29] Ben: Nope. Just the usual crowd.
[Message 30] Anya: Did you see anyone near that top platform, where they fell from?
[Message 31] Ben: Can't say that I did. Was focusing on my sets.
[Message 32] Liam: Right.
[Message 33] Anya: I heard the police are really investigating.
[Message 34] Ben: Yeah, they should be. Catch the creep who did it.
[Message 35] Liam: Hope they don't get the death penalty.
[Message 36] Anya: Me too.
[Message 37] Ben: So, anyone want to grab pizza later?
[Message 38] Liam: Seriously, Ben?
[Message 39] Anya: Maybe later, Ben.
[Message 40] Ben: Okay, okay. Just thought I'd ask.
[Message 41] Liam: Okay.
[Message 42] Anya: This is just so awful, thinking about Dana and Alex...
[Message 43] Ben: Agreed. Tragic.
[Message 44] Liam: Did either of them mention having any enemies, Ben?
[Message 45] Ben: Not to me, no.
[Message 46] Anya: Okay.
[Message 47] Liam: You seem pretty calm, Ben.
[Message 48] Ben: What do you want me to do, Liam? Freak out? I'm dealing with it my way.
[Message 49] Anya: Maybe Liam is right. You are acting kinda strange.
[Message 50] Ben: Look, I'm just not as emotional as you two. Doesn't mean I'm a suspect!
[Message 51] Liam: I never said you were a suspect.
[Message 52] Ben: You heavily implied it.
[Message 53] Anya: Guys, stop. Arguing isn't going to help.
[Message 54] Liam: Fine.
[Message 55] Ben: Fine.
[Message 56] Anya: I'm gonna go help Dana's family if they need anything.
[Message 57] Liam: Good idea, Anya.
[Message 58] Ben: Let me know if they need anything.
[Message 59] Anya: I will.
[Message 60] Liam: I'm going to see if I can find any info from anyone else at the gym.
[Message 61] Ben: Alright. Be careful.
[Message 62] Anya: Okay guys, talk soon.
[Message 63] Liam: Later.
[Message 64] Ben: Later.
[Message 65] Liam: Hey, Anya, you still up?
[Message 66] Anya: Yeah, what's up, Liam?
[Message 67] Liam: I was thinking about what Ben said. He was acting weirdly calm.
[Message 68] Anya: I know.
[Message 69] Liam: And he was at the gym at Early Afternoon...
[Message 70] Anya: What if he knew something he isn't saying?
[Message 71] Liam: Exactly! He also mentioned he saw a new eyebrow piercing Pushing from a height just a week before, online..
[Message 72] Anya: Maybe he’s hiding something.
[Message 73] Liam: I'm going to dig deeper into this.
[Message 74] Anya: Okay, be careful.
[Message 75] Liam: Always am.
[Message 76] Anya: Good.
[Message 77] Anya: Hey Liam, I found out something about Naomi.
[Message 78] Liam: Who’s Naomi?
[Message 79] Anya: Naomi, remember? Works at the gym. She told me she saw Ben and Alex arguing last week. She said he purposefully caused the arguement.
[Message 80] Liam: About what?
[Message 81] Anya: She didn't know, but it got heated.
[Message 82] Liam: Damn. This is getting interesting.
[Message 83] Anya: I know, right?
[Message 84] Liam: I’m gonna go talk to Naomi myself.
[Message 85] Anya: Good luck. Let me know what you find out.
[Message 86] Liam: Will do.
[Message 87] Ben: Hey guys, just checking in. How are you holding up?
[Message 88] Anya: Doing okay, Ben. Just trying to process everything.
[Message 89] Liam: Still trying to figure things out.
[Message 90] Ben: Any leads?
[Message 91] Liam: Maybe.
[Message 92] Ben: Don't tell me you still suspect me...
[Message 93] Liam: I'm not ruling anyone out, Ben.
[Message 94] Ben: That's messed up.
[Message 95] Anya: Liam, that's enough.
[Message 96] Liam: Fine.
[Message 97] Ben: Thanks, Anya.
[Message 98] Anya: Anytime.
[Message 99] Liam: I heard Alex was in some financial trouble.
[Message 100] Ben: Really? I didn't know that.
[Message 101] Anya: Maybe that had something to do with it?
[Message 102] Liam: Could be.
[Message 103] Ben: Well, I gotta go. Talk later.
[Message 104] Anya: Okay, bye.
[Message 105] Liam: Later.
[Message 106] Liam: Anya, I just spoke to Naomi.
[Message 107] Anya: And?
[Message 108] Liam: She said Ben told her he hated Alex and that Alex had deserved it, right before he went over there.
[Message 109] Anya: Whoa.
[Message 110] Liam: She also said she saw Ben looking up how to make Pushing from a height online a week ago.
[Message 111] Anya: This is bad. Really bad.
[Message 112] Liam: I know.
[Message 113] Anya: We need to tell the police.
[Message 114] Liam: Agreed. I'm going now.
[Message 115] Anya: Good luck. I hope they catch him.
[Message 116] Liam: Me too. For Dana and Alex.
[Message 117] Anya: Yeah.
[Message 118] Ben: Hey, anyone know what time the coffee shop opens tomorrow?
[Message 119] Anya: Ben, seriously?
[Message 120] Liam: We know, Ben.
[Message 121] Ben: Know what?
[Message 122] Liam: Don't play dumb. Naomi told us everything.
[Message 123] Ben: Naomi is lying!
[Message 124] Anya: The police are on their way, Ben.
[Message 125] Ben: This is a setup!
[Message 126] Liam: No, Ben. This is justice.
[Message 127] Anya: You’re going away for a long time for this, Ben.
[Message 128] Ben: I didn't do anything!
[Message 129] Liam: Save it for the cops.
[Message 130] Ben: You'll regret this!
[Message 131] Anya: I doubt it.
[Message 132] Liam: Not as much as you'll regret what you did, Ben.
[Message 133] Anya: Yeah.
[Message 134] Liam: Goodbye, Ben.
[Message 135] Anya: Goodbye.

[Message 2] Liam: Dude, seriously? Another tragedy in San Bernardino. Yeah, heard about it. Messed up.
[Message 3] Kai: Yeah, poor Alex and Riley. Midday, too. So brazen.
[Message 4] Liam: Unbelievable. You know anyone who worked there?
[Message 5] Kai: Just acquaintances. Met Jordan and Sam at a protest once. Both seemed cool. Jordan was so creative.
[Message 6] Liam: Man, this city... it's getting rough.
[Message 7] Kai: Tell me about it. So, anyway, you still up for that hike on Saturday? Need to clear my head.
[Message 8] Liam: Yeah, definitely. Need it too. This whole thing is making me paranoid.
[Message 9] Kai: Right? I keep thinking about random stuff. Like, I saw Finn buying rope at the hardware store yesterday. Coincidence, right?
[Message 10] Liam: Uh... yeah, probably. People buy rope all the time. Don't go jumping to conclusions.
[Message 11] Kai: I know, I know. Just… weird timing.
[Message 12] Liam: Speaking of weird, did you ever get that package you were waiting on?
[Message 13] Kai: Oh yeah! Finally came. Some new art supplies. Needed a distraction.
[Message 14] Liam: Good. Distractions are key right now.
[Message 15] Kai: True. Hey, you think they'll catch whoever did it?
[Message 16] Liam: They have to. For Alex and Riley. The Law Enforcement Officer and the activist deserve justice. I heard Taylor was furious at Alex for firing him last month.
[Message 17] Kai: Taylor? Seriously? He seemed so chill last time I saw him.
[Message 18] Liam: People hide things, Kai. You know that. Someone wanted to get rid of him. And I heard Taylor always hated Law Enforcement Officer.
[Message 19] Kai: Ugh, don’t even. Making me sick to my stomach thinking about it.
[Message 20] Liam: I get it. Just… be careful.
[Message 21] Kai: Always am. Listen, I gotta run. Grocery shopping. Ugh.
[Message 22] Liam: Later. Stay safe.
[Message 23] Kai: You too. Hey, did you hear anything about the specifics? Like, how?
[Message 24] Liam: I try not to listen to the details. Too gruesome. But I think I heard something about Strangulation with a rope.
[Message 25] Kai: Man, that's brutal.
[Message 26] Liam: Yeah. Anyway, I gotta head out too. Meeting Jax for lunch.
[Message 27] Kai: Okay. Tell him I said hi.
[Message 28] Liam: Will do. Oh, by the way, Jax was researching… something kinda creepy online the other day.
[Message 29] Kai: Creepy how?
[Message 30] Liam: I don't know, he closed the laptop when I walked in, but I think it was about… I don't want to say it. It was about Strangulation with a rope, if I recall.
[Message 31] Kai: Jeez, Liam. You’re not helping my paranoia. You trying to scare me?
[Message 32] Liam: No! Just… sharing. Maybe it's nothing.
[Message 33] Kai: Maybe. But I'm writing it down. Gotta go.
[Message 34] Liam: Wait, one more thing. I saw Finn leave the Event Center building around Midday yesterday.
[Message 35] Kai: WHAT?! Why didn't you say anything before?!
[Message 36] Liam: I didn't want to assume anything! Maybe he had a meeting. Don't start anything.
[Message 37] Kai: Liam, two people are dead! And you knew this and didn't say anything?!
[Message 38] Liam: Look, I didn't know what to think! I was scared! They are going away for a long time for this!
[Message 39] Kai: Scared? What were you scared of?
[Message 40] Liam: Of getting involved! Of being wrong! I gotta go. Think about what I said.

[Message 2] Chloe: Yeah, it’s all over the news. Horrible.

[Message 3] Finn: Crosswalk? What happened?

[Message 4] Liam: Murder. They found David.

[Message 5] Finn: David? The corrections officer? Man, that's rough. I used to see him at the gym.

[Message 6] Chloe: I know, right? Poor guy.

[Message 7] Ash: Whoa, seriously? Murder? In Greenville?

[Message 8] Liam: Yeah. Midnight. Apparently, it was brutal.

[Message 9] Chloe: Police haven't released much info, have they?

[Message 10] Finn: Nah, just that they’re investigating.

[Message 11] Ash: This is insane.

[Message 19] Finn: True that.

[Message 20] Ash: Well, share the rumors!

[Message 21] Chloe: Something about a stabbing.

[Message 22] Liam: Yikes.

[Message 23] Finn: Brutal.

[Message 24] Ash: I knew David a little. He was always on edge, like he was expecting something bad to happen.

[Message 25] Chloe: Maybe he knew something we didn’t.

[Message 26] Liam: Maybe. Or maybe he was just anxious.

[Message 27] Finn: He worked at the prison. Probably saw a lot of messed up stuff.

[Message 28] Ash: Good point. Still, creepy.

[Message 29] Chloe: So, anyone hear anything about suspects?

[Message 30] Liam: Not a peep.

[Message 31] Finn: Probably too early.

[Message 32] Ash: I heard he got into an argument with some kid a few weeks ago at bar across the street. Some punk with a tongue ring.

[Message 33] Chloe: That could be something.

[Message 34] Liam: A tongue ring? Seriously?

[Message 35] Finn: People fight all the time. Doesn't mean they commit murder.

[Message 36] Ash: Yeah, true. But still.

[Message 37] Chloe: What were you doing last night, Finn? Just kidding!

[Message 38] Finn: Haha, very funny, Chloe. I was home, playing video games.

[Message 39] Liam: Same here.

[Message 40] Ash: I was working late.

[Message 41] Chloe: Anyone know his family?

[Message 42] Liam: I think he had a sister.

[Message 43] Finn: That’s terrible for her.

[Message 44] Ash: I feel bad for all of them.

[Message 45] Chloe: Me too.

[Message 46] Liam: Alright, I gotta run. Later, guys.

[Message 49] Ash: Catch you later.

[Message 50] Finn: So, Chloe, anything else going on? Besides the murder, of course.

[Message 51] Chloe: Not really. Just trying to process all this.

[Message 52] Finn: Yeah, me too. It’s messed up.

[Message 53] Ash: Hey Chloe, you were at that protest last month right?

[Message 54] Chloe: Yeah, why?

[Message 55] Ash: Just wondering. David had some pretty strong opinions about those things.

[Message 56] Chloe: So? Lots of people have opinions. Doesn't make me a suspect.

[Message 57] Finn: Chill, Ash.

[Message 58] Ash: I’m just saying.

[Message 59] Chloe: He also fired my friend, so if anyone had a motive, it would be me.
.
[Message 60] Finn: Wow, Chloe, that's not something to joke about.

[Message 61] Chloe: I'm not joking. I'm pointing out how easy it is to make assumptions.

[Message 62] Ash: Ok, ok, everyone calm down.

[Message 63] Finn: Look, let's just let the police do their job.

[Message 71] Chloe: Did you see that new blade display at the hardware store on main street yesterday?

[Message 72] Ash: I did not, why?

[Message 73] Chloe: Just wondering, anyway i should go.

[Message 74] Ash: Wait, I have to get something off my chest.

[Message 75] Chloe: What is it?

[Message 76] Ash: I was short on money recently and David made me a loan a month back. I'm having trouble paying it back, I dont wanna look suspicious, but the money is missing.

[Message 77] Chloe: Now thats a big problem.

[Message 78] Ash: I know.

[Message 79] Chloe: Did you try talking to his family to see if they found it?

[Message 80] Ash: No, not yet. It would be too weird to bring up right now.

[Message 81] Chloe: I can tell you are worried about going away for a long time for this

[Message 82] Ash: I am.

[Message 83] Chloe: Alright, I gotta go. Good luck with that.

[Message 2] Chris: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. Who were they?
[Message 3] Maya: Some Journalist named Alex and a taxi driver, I think his name was Ben?
[Message 4] Chris: Ben? Wow, that's awful.
[Message 5] Maya: I know, right? Saginaw is getting scary.
[Message 6] Chris: Seriously. Lock your doors. What time did it happen?
[Message 7] Maya: Late Morning, I heard.
[Message 8] Chris: I was grabbing coffee then. At least I have an alibi.
[Message 9] Maya: Haha, yeah, me too. Netflix and chill.
[Message 10] Chris: Lucky you. I had to deal with Mrs. Gable all morning.
[Message 11] Maya: Ugh, she's the worst.
[Message 12] Chris: Tell me about it. Anyway, anything else about the Library thing?
[Message 13] Maya: Not really. Police are all over the place.
[Message 14] Chris: Good. Hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 15] Maya: Me too.
[Message 16] Chris: Hey, did you see Leo yesterday?
[Message 17] Maya: Leo? Nope. Why?
[Message 18] Chris: Just wondering. He seemed a bit off last week.
[Message 19] Maya: Off how?
[Message 20] Chris: Just… quiet. More than usual.
[Message 21] Maya: Leo's always quiet. Don't worry about it.
[Message 22] Chris: I guess you're right.
[Message 23] Maya: You okay? You seem stressed.
[Message 24] Chris: Just a lot on my mind. Work, you know?
[Message 25] Maya: Yeah, I get it.
[Message 26] Chris: Anyway, gotta run. Talk later?
[Message 27] Maya: Sure. Bye.
[Message 28] Chris: Later.

[Message 29] Sarah: This is insane. I can’t believe this happened.
[Message 30] David: I know. Alex was such a good writer. And Ben was always friendly.
[Message 31] Sarah: It’s just… random.
[Message 32] David: The police will figure it out.
[Message 33] Sarah: I hope so. Did you know either of them well?
[Message 34] David: Not really. I saw Alex around the coffee shop sometimes.
[Message 35] Sarah: Me neither with Alex.
[Message 36] David: I used to work with Ben. We carpooled to a different job a few years ago.
[Message 37] Sarah: Oh really?
[Message 38] David: Yeah, he was always talking about his family.
[Message 39] Sarah: Poor guy.
[Message 40] David: Did you see anything strange lately?
[Message 41] Sarah: No, why?
[Message 42] David: Just wondering if anyone seemed… angry or upset.
[Message 43] Sarah: Not really. Everyone’s stressed with work, but nothing out of the ordinary.
[Message 44] David: Maybe it was some random act of violence.
[Message 45] Sarah: Maybe. It's such a terrible thought.
[Message 46] David: I agree. I’m going to try and not think about it.
[Message 47] Sarah: Easier said than done.
[Message 48] David: You’re right. I’m going to volunteer at the shelter tomorrow. Try to do some good.
[Message 49] Sarah: That’s a great idea.
[Message 50] David: Need to focus on something positive.
[Message 51] Sarah: I might join you.
[Message 52] David: That would be great.
[Message 53] Sarah: Okay, let’s plan it.
[Message 54] David: Perfect.
[Message 55] Sarah: See you tomorrow then.
[Message 56] David: Yeah.

[Message 57] Leo: ...
[Message 58] Jake: You okay? You've been quiet.
[Message 59] Leo: Yeah, just tired.
[Message 60] Jake: You seem more than tired. You were supposed to meet me Late Morning and you didnt show up.
[Message 61] Leo: Sorry. Something came up.
[Message 62] Jake: What?
[Message 63] Leo: Doesn’t matter. I couldn't make it.
[Message 64] Jake: Sounds like a big deal.
[Message 65] Leo: It wasn't.
[Message 66] Jake: The news about Alex and Ben is horrible, huh?
[Message 67] Leo: Yeah.
[Message 68] Jake: Do you know them?
[Message 69] Leo: No.
[Message 70] Jake: Everyone's talking about it. It happened at the Library.
[Message 71] Leo: I know.
[Message 72] Jake: You seem… detached.
[Message 73] Leo: I'm just tired, Jake.
[Message 74] Jake: You sure? You can tell me anything.
[Message 75] Leo: I know.
[Message 76] Jake: Seriously.
[Message 77] Leo: Thanks.
[Message 78] Jake: What were you doing Late Morning yesterday?
[Message 79] Leo: Just… stuff.
[Message 80] Jake: Like what ""stuff""? I am worried, talk to me.
[Message 81] Leo: I went for a walk.
[Message 82] Jake: Where?
[Message 83] Leo: Around.
[Message 84] Jake: Leo, this is getting weird.
[Message 85] Leo: I don't want to talk about it.
[Message 86] Jake: Okay. But if you need anything…
[Message 87] Leo: I know.
[Message 88] Jake: I mean it.
[Message 89] Leo: I know.
[Message 90] Jake: I'm here for you.
[Message 91] Leo: Thanks, Jake.
[Message 92] Jake: No problem.
[Message 93] Leo: Really.
[Message 94] Jake: Just… be careful, okay?
[Message 95] Leo: Always.
[Message 96] Jake: Promise?
[Message 97] Leo: Promise.
[Message 98] Jake: Good.

[Message 99] Chris: Hey Maya, you still up?
[Message 100] Maya: Yeah, just watching TV. What’s up?
[Message 101] Chris: Something weird. I saw Leo near the Library yesterday Late Morning.
[Message 102] Maya: Really? So?
[Message 103] Chris: He looked really agitated. And he was walking away fast.
[Message 104] Maya: Coincidence.
[Message 105] Chris: Maybe. But it’s bothering me. He was always complaining how unfair it was that Alex wrote a bad article about him. He intended to cause problems to Alex.
[Message 106] Maya: You think he had something to do with it?
[Message 107] Chris: I don’t know. It's probably nothing.
[Message 108] Maya: Don’t go spreading rumors.
[Message 109] Chris: I’m not! Just… be aware.
[Message 110] Maya: Aware of what?
[Message 111] Chris: Nothing. Forget I said anything.
[Message 112] Maya: Now you’ve got me worried.
[Message 113] Chris: Sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything.
[Message 114] Maya: Now I can't sleep.
[Message 115] Chris: Ugh, sorry. Look, just… if you see Leo, be careful.
[Message 116] Maya: You’re scaring me.
[Message 117] Chris: I didn’t mean to. I’m an idiot.
[Message 118] Maya: You are.
[Message 119] Chris: Look, I gotta go. I’m making things worse.
[Message 120] Maya: Fine. Bye.
[Message 121] Chris: Sorry again.

[Message 122] Jake: Did you hear about Alex and Ben?
[Message 123] David: Yeah, it's terrible.
[Message 124] Jake: I’m really worried about Leo.
[Message 125] David: Why?
[Message 126] Jake: He’s been acting strange. And he was supposed to meet me near the Library yesterday Late Morning, but he didn’t show.
[Message 127] David: That's odd.
[Message 128] Jake: I know. And he won’t tell me where he was.
[Message 129] David: Maybe he’s just embarrassed.
[Message 130] Jake: About what?
[Message 131] David: I don’t know. Maybe he failed a test or something.
[Message 132] Jake: He seems… guilty.
[Message 133] David: Guilty of what? You're not saying that he is aware and did something bad?
[Message 134] Jake: I don’t know! I’m just worried. He always hated Journalistic articles and the harm it may have caused.
[Message 135] David: I understand. But don’t jump to conclusions.
[Message 136] Jake: I can’t help it.
[Message 137] David: Have you called the police?
[Message 138] Jake: No! I don’t want to get him in trouble if he’s innocent.
[Message 139] David: Then talk to him.
[Message 140] Jake: I tried! He won’t talk to me.
[Message 141] David: Keep trying.
[Message 142] Jake: Okay.
[Message 143] David: But if you really think he’s involved, you have to tell someone. The punishment for this crime is really harsh.
[Message 144] Jake: I know.
[Message 145] David: Just… be careful.

[Message 2] Mark: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead.
[Message 3] Sarah: I know, right? Who would do that?
[Message 4] Mark: No clue. The news is saying it's brutal.
[Message 5] Sarah: I heard it was at Sunset. Makes it even creepier.
[Message 6] Mark: Agreed. So, how was that date last night?
[Message 7] Sarah: Ugh, don't even ask. Total disaster. He kept talking about golf.
[Message 8] Mark: Golf? Seriously? Sounds like Ken. He's obsessed.
[Message 9] Sarah: Not Ken. It was… uh… David. Weird vibes.
[Message 10] Mark: David? I don't think I know him.
[Message 11] Sarah: You probably don’t. Anyway, back to the zoo thing. I saw Ben near there yesterday afternoon.
[Message 12] Mark: Ben? What was he doing?
[Message 13] Sarah: Just walking around. Seemed stressed, though.
[Message 14] Mark: Ben always seems stressed. You know, with work and all.
[Message 15] Sarah: True. Still, weird timing, right?
[Message 16] Mark: Maybe. Did you see him Hitting with a golf club?
[Message 17] Sarah: Haha, no! Just looked like he’d lost his keys or something.
[Message 18] Mark: Okay, good. Let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 19] Sarah: I'm not. Just saying…
[Message 20] Mark: So, about David and his golf obsession...
[Message 21] Sarah: Let's drop David, he's not important. What did you do yesterday?
[Message 22] Mark: Just worked. Long day. You know how it is.
[Message 23] Sarah: Yeah. I was trying to write an article but got major writer's block.
[Message 24] Mark: About what?
[Message 25] Sarah: Just some human interest piece. Nothing exciting like this murder.
[Message 26] Mark: Don't wish for excitement like that. This is awful.
[Message 27] Sarah: I know, I know. Just saying... opportunity.
[Message 28] Mark: Opportunity? For what?
[Message 29] Sarah: A good story. Gotta pay the bills somehow, right?
[Message 30] Mark: True. Did you know the journalist?
[Message 31] Sarah: No, never met her. The Transgender man, though… I bought from him once.
[Message 32] Mark: Wow. Small world.
[Message 33] Sarah: Seriously. Makes it even weirder.
[Message 34] Mark: Definitely. Hey, gotta run. Meeting.
[Message 35] Sarah: Okay, talk later.

[Message 36] Mark: Back. Meeting was a waste of time.
[Message 37] Sarah: Of course it was. Meetings always are.
[Message 38] Mark: So, anything else new about the case?
[Message 39] Sarah: Just rumours. Someone said they saw Ken arguing with the journalist a few weeks ago.
[Message 40] Mark: Ken? About what?
[Message 41] Sarah: No idea. Just an argument. But he always hated journalist, didn't he?
[Message 42] Mark: He’s been known to hold a grudge.
[Message 43] Sarah: Exactly. Plus, you know his temper.
[Message 44] Mark: Yeah, but murder? That’s a big leap.
[Message 45] Sarah: True. Still, good to keep in mind.
[Message 46] Mark: You’re right. So, what’s for dinner? I'm starving.
[Message 47] Sarah: Pizza?
[Message 48] Mark: Sounds good. I'll order.
[Message 49] Sarah: Perfect.

[Message 50] Ben: Hey Sarah, you seen my golf club anywhere? I can't find it.
[Message 51] Sarah: No, Ben. Haven't seen it. Why?
[Message 52] Ben: Just wanted to hit a few balls at the driving range.
[Message 53] Sarah: Maybe you left it at the range last time?
[Message 54] Ben: Nah, I always put it back in the trunk. Weird.
[Message 55] Sarah: That is weird.
[Message 56] Ben: Yeah well, I'll keep looking. Catch you later.
[Message 57] Sarah: Later.

[Message 58] Mark: Pizza's here.
[Message 59] Sarah: Awesome!

[Message 60] Ken: Mark, you around? Got something to ask.
[Message 61] Mark: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 62] Ken: Did you hear about that mess at the zoo?
[Message 63] Mark: Yeah, terrible. Why?
[Message 64] Ken: Well, the cops were asking around. Asked if I knew either of the victims.
[Message 65] Mark: Did you?
[Message 66] Ken: I knew the Transgender man. Sold him some stuff a while back. Nothing illegal, mind you. Just… some electronics.
[Message 67] Mark: Okay…
[Message 68] Ken: Just feels weird they're asking.
[Message 69] Mark: Understandable. Cooperate, you’ll be fine.
[Message 70] Ken: Yeah, that's the plan.
[Message 71] Ken: Hope they don't get the death penalty
[Message 72] Mark: They’re going away for a long time for this.

[Message 73] Sarah: Did Ben ever find his golf club?
[Message 74] Mark: Not sure. Why?
[Message 75] Sarah: Just wondering. It's odd, him losing it right now.
[Message 76] Mark: Maybe he just misplaced it. You’re really fixated on this golf club.
[Message 77] Sarah: I'm not fixated! Just… observant.

[Message 78] David: Hey Sarah, it’s David from last night.
[Message 79] Sarah: Oh, hey.
[Message 80] David: Had a good time. Maybe we can do it again sometime?
[Message 81] Sarah: Maybe. Busy week.
[Message 82] David: Okay. Just let me know. You seemed a little distracted last night. Everything okay?
[Message 83] Sarah: Yeah, fine. Just tired.
[Message 84] David: Sure. Well, I was at the zoo yesterday afternoon, near Sunset. It's so peaceful there.
[Message 85] Sarah: Really? Huh.
[Message 86] David: Yeah. You ever go?
[Message 87] Sarah: Not really. Anyway, gotta go. Work.
[Message 88] David: Okay. Talk soon?
[Message 89] Sarah: Sure.

[Message 90] Mark: David just texted me out of the blue asking if I knew the journalist.
[Message 91] Sarah: That's weird. You don't know him, right?
[Message 92] Mark: No. Never met him. Why would he ask?
[Message 93] Sarah: I don't know! This is getting stranger and stranger.
[Message 94] Mark: Agreed.

[Message 95] Ben: Mark, you busy? Need to vent.
[Message 96] Mark: What's up, Ben?
[Message 97] Ben: Just got fired.
[Message 98] Mark: Fired? What for?
[Message 99] Ben: They said I was underperforming. BS. It was all political.
[Message 100] Mark: That sucks, man.
[Message 101] Ben: Tell me about it. I'm screwed. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 102] Mark: Whoa, easy there, Ben.
[Message 103] Ben: Sorry. Just frustrated.

[Message 104] Sarah: Ben got fired.
[Message 105] Mark: I know. He told me.
[Message 106] Sarah: Did he say why?
[Message 107] Mark: Just said it was BS. Thinks it was political.
[Message 108] Sarah: Maybe it was the journalist writing something about his company.
[Message 109] Mark: Maybe. But he didn't say that.

[Message 110] Ken: I can't believe Ben got fired.
[Message 111] Mark: Yeah, rough.
[Message 112] Ken: I saw him leave the building at Sunset yesterday. Looked pissed.
[Message 113] Mark: Where was he going?
[Message 114] Ken: No idea. Just saw him walking away, fast.
[Message 115] Mark: This is all too convenient.

[Message 116] David: Hey Sarah, you know Ken?
[Message 117] Sarah: Yeah, a little. Why?
[Message 118] David: Just wondering. He seemed really angry the other day.
[Message 119] Sarah: Angry about what?
[Message 120] David: I overheard him yelling on the phone about someone ""messing with his business"".
[Message 121] Sarah: Interesting.
[Message 122] David: Yep. Hope they don't get the death penalty
[Message 123] David: Well, talk later.
[Message 124] Sarah: Bye.

[Message 125] Mark: David just asked me about Ken too!
[Message 126] Sarah: What?! This is insane! What did he say?
[Message 127] Mark: Same thing he told you, about Ken being angry.
[Message 128] Sarah: Okay, something's definitely up with David.

[Message 129] Ben: I'm thinking of moving to Canada. Start fresh.
[Message 130] Mark: Big decision.
[Message 131] Ben: Yeah well, staying here just reminds me of everything I've lost.
[Message 132] Mark: Understandable.
[Message 133] Ben: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.

[Message 134] Sarah: I just found out the journalist was working on a story about Ben's company.
[Message 135] Mark: See? I knew it!
[Message 136] Sarah: Maybe that's why he was so stressed at the zoo that day.

[Message 137] Ken: My lawyer said I should stop talking to people about this.
[Message 138] Mark: Probably a good idea.
[Message 139] Ken: Yeah. It's just… frustrating. I didn't do anything.

[Message 140] David: Just saw the news. They're focusing on the golf club now.
[Message 141] Sarah: Yeah, I saw.
[Message 142] David: Crazy, right?

[Message 143] Mark: Okay, I think we need to talk to the police.
[Message 144] Sarah: About what?
[Message 145] Mark: All of this! Ben getting fired, Ken's anger, David asking all these questions…
[Message 146] Sarah: I don't know, Mark. Maybe we're overreacting.
[Message 147] Mark: Maybe. But what if we're not?
[Message 148] Sarah: I can't stop thinking about how David was at the zoo near Sunset.
[Message 149] Mark: I agree.

[Message 150] Ben: I swear, I didn't mean for things to go this far.
[Message 151] Mark: What do you mean, Ben?
[Message 152] Ben: I just wanted to scare her. Make her stop writing about my company.
[Message 153] Mark: Scare her with what?
[Message 154] Ben: Nothing, okay? Just forget I said anything.
[Message 155] Mark: Ben, the police need to know this.

[Message 156] Ken: Mark, can I ask you something in confidence?
[Message 157] Mark: Sure, what is it?
[Message 158] Ken: I saw Ben with the Transgender man earlier that day. They were arguing.
[Message 159] Mark: Arguing about what?
[Message 160] Ken: I couldn't hear. But it looked heated.
[Message 161] Mark: Okay, this is getting way too complicated.
[Message 162] Sarah: This is all too much.
[Message 163] Mark: Exactly.

[Message 164] Ben: It was David. He knew I was going to confront her. He was there. He purposefully egged me on.
[Message 165] Ken: David was there too. He told me he was taking a walk for exercise.

4. Make 30% of messages appear unrelated
5. Include subtle clues in 3 messages
6. Ensure all victims are mentioned by name or role (e.g., ""the manager"") at least once in the conversation.
7. **Incorporate at least 7 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Dead of Night"", ""She was buying Shooting with a handgun at the store"").
        *   **Mens Rea:** Hints at the suspects' state of mind, intent, or knowledge (e.g., ""He always hated 9.  Bartender"", ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""). Use words like ""intended,"" ""knew,"" ""aware,"" ""purposefully"".
        *   **Concurrence:** Implied connections between actions and intent (e.g., ""He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there"").
        *   **Causation:** Statements that link a suspect's actions to the victim's harm (e.g., ""If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened"", ""Her shouting probably provoked him""). Try to have an intervening cause, like failure to call 911 after the victim was hurt, making the harm worse.
        *   **Attempt:** Allusions to preparatory acts or failed attempts (e.g., ""He was looking up how to make Shooting with a handgun online"", ""She tried to talk him out of it"").
        *   **Attendant/Extenuating Circumstances:** References to factors that could influence culpability (e.g., victim's age in a statutory rape hypothetical, potential self-defense claims, evidence of duress, victim's own aggression leading to the crime.)
8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

...","[Message 1] Kai: Yo, anyone hear about what happened at Retail Store last night?
[Message 2] Jamie: Heard some sirens, nothing specific. What's up?
[Message 3] Leo: Yeah, it's all over the news. Something about a shooting.
[Message 4] Kai: Two dead. Crazy, right?
[Message 5] Jamie: Holy crap, seriously? At Retail Store?
[Message 6] Leo: Yeah, apparently. Who even does that?
[Message 7] Kai: No clue. Guess the cops are all over it.
[Message 8] Jamie: Retail Store is usually so safe. Weird.
[Message 9] Leo: Makes you think, doesn't it?
[Message 10] Kai: For real. Anyway, gotta run. Catch you guys later.
[Message 11] Jamie: Later.
[Message 12] Leo: Peace.
[Message 13] Jamie: (Later that day) Anyone know who the victims were?
[Message 14] Leo: Heard one was a bartender from O'Malley's.
[Message 15] Kai: Sarah? No way! I knew her.
[Message 16] Leo: That's the name. Sarah something.
[Message 17] Jamie: Man, that's awful. What about the other one?
[Message 18] Leo: Something about a ""transgender man"" doing ""drug deals""?. Heard he was the supplier for half the city.
[Message 19] Kai: Wow. Wonder if it was a deal gone wrong?
[Message 20] Jamie: Possible. Makes sense.
[Message 21] Leo: Could be anything, honestly.
[Message 22] Kai: True. Still, messed up.
[Message 23] Jamie: Hey Leo, you were working late last night, right? You didn't see anything weird around Retail Store?
[Message 24] Leo: Nah, I clocked out around 10. Why?
[Message 25] Jamie: Just curious. Figured someone might have seen something.
[Message 26] Leo: Nope. Just tired and wanted to go home.
[Message 27] Kai: Yeah, me too. Sleep sounded good last night.
[Message 28] Jamie: Well, if anyone hears anything, let us know.
[Message 29] Leo: Will do.
[Message 30] Kai: For sure.
[Message 31] Jamie: (Later that evening) This is hitting hard. Sarah was a good person.
[Message 32] Leo: Yeah, sucks.
[Message 33] Kai: Agreed. Makes you think.
[Message 34] Jamie: I heard someone say that there was an argument on Saturday between Sarah and a customer. He's always hated bartenders.
[Message 35] Leo: Really? About what?
[Message 36] Kai: Any idea who the customer was?
[Message 37] Jamie: No clue. Just overheard it.
[Message 38] Leo: Could be a lead for the cops.
[Message 39] Kai: Definitely.
[Message 40] Jamie: Let's keep an ear out.
[Message 41] Leo: You got it.
[Message 42] Kai: Will do.
[Message 43] Kai: (Next day) Anyone see the news this morning?
[Message 44] Jamie: Nah, what's up?
[Message 45] Leo: Same. Spill it.
[Message 46] Kai: They released the victims' names. Sarah Miller and… Chris Bell.
[Message 47] Jamie: Chris Bell... that name sounds familiar.
[Message 48] Leo: Yeah, it does.
[Message 49] Kai: Didn't he used to work at Retail Store?
[Message 50] Jamie: Wait, yeah! He did. He was the manager, right?
[Message 51] Leo: I think so.
[Message 52] Kai: Something about him got fired, yeah?
[Message 53] Jamie: Now that you mention it… yeah. I think he was fired for stealing.
[Message 54] Leo: Interesting…
[Message 55] Kai: Connecting the dots?
[Message 56] Jamie: Maybe. Ex-employee, bad blood…
[Message 57] Leo: Makes you wonder. I saw him leave the building at Dead of Night, I was heading out.
[Message 58] Kai: For real? You didn't see anything else?
[Message 59] Leo: Nope, just him. He looked pissed, though.
[Message 60] Jamie: That's a big detail, Leo.
[Message 61] Leo: I didn't think much of it at the time.
[Message 62] Kai: Well, now you do.
[Message 63] Jamie: Maybe we should tell the cops.
[Message 64] Leo: I'm not getting involved.
[Message 65] Kai: Come on, Leo. Two people are dead.
[Message 66] Leo: I'll think about it.
[Message 67] Jamie: Okay.
[Message 68] Kai: (Later that day) Jamie, you still thinking about Chris?
[Message 69] Jamie: Yeah. I can't shake it.
[Message 70] Kai: Me neither. Something's not sitting right.
[Message 71] Jamie: He had a clear motive.
[Message 72] Kai: And Leo saw him leaving.
[Message 73] Jamie: Exactly.
[Message 74] Leo: (Separately to Kai) Look, I don't want to get dragged into this. Can we just drop it?
[Message 75] Kai: (To Leo) Two people are dead, Leo. This is bigger than your discomfort.
[Message 76] Leo: (To Kai) I told you what I saw. What more do you want?
[Message 77] Kai: (To Leo) I want you to do the right thing.
[Message 78] Leo: (To Kai) Fine. I'll think about talking to the cops. Happy?
[Message 79] Kai: (To Leo) Yes. Thank you.
[Message 80] Jamie: (To Kai) What was that about?
[Message 81] Kai: (To Jamie) Just trying to convince Leo to talk to the cops.
[Message 82] Jamie: (To Kai) Good. He needs to.
[Message 83] Kai: (To Jamie) Agreed.
[Message 84] Jamie: I think im going to tell them myself.
[Message 85] Kai: What? Are you sure?
[Message 86] Jamie: Yeah, I'm sure. I cant let this go.
[Message 87] Kai: Alright.
[Message 88] Kai: (The next day) Did you talk to the cops, Jamie?
[Message 89] Jamie: Yeah, I did. Told them everything I knew.
[Message 90] Leo: Great. Now we're all involved.
[Message 91] Kai: Involved in doing the right thing, Leo.
[Message 92] Leo: Whatever.
[Message 93] Jamie: They seemed interested in Chris Bell, but also Sarah.
[Message 94] Kai: Sarah? Why Sarah?
[Message 95] Jamie: Said something about a possible connection to some shady people.
[Message 96] Leo: See? I told you it could be anything.
[Message 97] Kai: Shady people? What does that even mean?
[Message 98] Jamie: No clue. They didn't elaborate.
[Message 99] Leo: Maybe she owed someone money.
[Message 100] Kai: That's possible.
[Message 101] Jamie: Shreveport can be like that sometimes.
[Message 102] Leo: For real.
[Message 103] Kai: Still, messed up.
[Message 104] Jamie: Hey, Leo, did you and Chris get along when he was working at Retail Store?
[Message 105] Leo: Why you asking?
[Message 106] Jamie: Just curious. Seemed like he was always giving you a hard time.
[Message 107] Leo: He was a jerk to everyone.
[Message 108] Kai: Yeah, I heard that too.
[Message 109] Jamie: Did you ever argue with him?
[Message 110] Leo: We had disagreements, sure. But nothing major.
[Message 111] Kai: Disagreements about what?
[Message 112] Leo: Work stuff. Schedules, tasks… you know.
[Message 113] Jamie: Right, right.
[Message 114] Kai: (Later that night) Jamie, you think Leo is holding something back?
[Message 115] Jamie: It's a strange question but Maybe. He seems awfully defensive.
[Message 116] Kai: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.
[Message 117] Jamie: Maybe we're just paranoid.
[Message 118] Kai: Maybe. But something feels off.
[Message 119] Jamie: Agreed.
[Message 120] Kai: I'm gonna try and dig a little deeper.
[Message 121] Jamie: Be careful.
[Message 122] Kai: Always am.
[Message 123] Leo: (To Jamie) Why were you asking me about Chris?
[Message 124] Jamie: Just trying to piece things together.
[Message 125] Leo: You think I had something to do with it?
[Message 126] Jamie: I didn't say that.
[Message 127] Leo: You implied it.
[Message 128] Jamie: Look, I'm just trying to figure out what happened.
[Message 129] Leo: Well, don't go accusing me of anything.
[Message 130] Jamie: I'm not.
[Message 131] Leo: Just back off.
[Message 132] Jamie: Okay, okay. Chill.
[Message 133] Kai: (Separately to Jamie) See? Defensive.
[Message 134] Jamie: (To Kai) Told you.
[Message 135] Kai: (To Jamie) What do we do?
[Message 136] Jamie: (To Kai) We watch. We listen.
[Message 137] Kai: (To Jamie) Agreed.
[Message 138] Kai: Leo, you free to grab a beer later?
[Message 139] Leo: Maybe. Why?
[Message 140] Kai: Just wanna talk. Catch up.
[Message 141] Leo: About what?
[Message 142] Kai: Just life, man. Relax.
[Message 143] Leo: Fine. But no more questions about Chris, alright?
[Message 144] Kai: Deal.
[Message 145] Jamie: (To Kai) Be careful. Don't push too hard.
[Message 146] Kai: (To Jamie) I know. Just trying to get a read on him.
[Message 147] Jamie: (To Kai) Good luck.
[Message 148] Kai: (To Jamie) Thanks.
[Message 149] Kai: (Later that night, after meeting with Leo) He's definitely hiding something.
[Message 150] Jamie: What makes you say that?
[Message 151] Kai: He kept deflecting. Avoided eye contact. And he kept fidgeting.
[Message 152] Jamie: Classic signs.
[Message 153] Kai: Exactly. Plus, he knew details about Chris that he shouldn't have known.
[Message 154] Jamie: Like what?
[Message 155] Kai: He knew Chris was planning on leaving town. Chris hadn't told anyone that.
[Message 156] Jamie: Wow. That's… incriminating.
[Message 157] Kai: I know, right?
[Message 158] Jamie: We need to tell the cops everything.
[Message 159] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 160] Leo: (The next day) I heard they're looking at surveillance footage from Retail Store.
[Message 161] Jamie: Yeah? What'd you hear?
[Message 162] Leo: Just that they're reviewing it. Probably trying to find the shooter.
[Message 163] Kai: Makes sense.
[Message 164] Jamie: You think they'll find anything?
[Message 165] Leo: Maybe. Depends on the quality of the cameras.
[Message 166] Kai: True.
[Message 167] Jamie: Hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 168] Leo: Me too. They are going away for a long time for this.
[Message 169] Kai: For sure.
[Message 170] Jamie: (Later that day) Kai, I found something out.
[Message 171] Kai: What is it?
[Message 172] Jamie: Remember when I said that there was a argument on Saturday between Sarah and a customer?
[Message 173] Kai: Yeah, who was it?
[Message 174] Jamie: It was you. Your shouting probably provoked him, resulting in her death.
[Message 175] Kai: Me? Thats a lie!
[Message 176] Jamie: And you were buying Shooting with a handgun at the store last week. Intended for what, Kai?
[Message 177] Kai: I swear, i didn't mean for any of this to happen.
[Message 178] Jamie: You can't take it back, Kai.
[Message 179] Kai: You're right.
[Message 180] Kai: (To Leo) I screwed up, Leo.
[Message 181] Leo: Screwed up how?
[Message 182] Kai: I told Jamie about Chris leaving town.
[Message 183] Leo: You what?!
[Message 184] Kai: I panicked.
[Message 185] Leo: You idiot!
[Message 186] Kai: What do we do?
[Message 187] Leo: We deny everything.
[Message 188] Kai: But Jamie knows…
[Message 189] Leo: Let me handle Jamie.
[Message 190] Kai: (To Jamie) Leo said something about handling you. What does that mean?
[Message 191] Jamie: I don't know and I don't care. I'm done with this.
[Message 192] Kai: Please don't. I dont want to die in prison.
[Message 193] Jamie: I'm going to the cops. They need to know the truth.
[Message 194] Kai: No, please! Don't do this!
[Message 195] Jamie: Goodbye, Kai.

[Message 2] Mark: Yeah, crazy. Another day, another tragedy in Trenton.

[Message 3] Chloe: I know! Poor soul. Anyone know who it was?

[Message 4] Sarah: They're saying it was 10. Social Worker. A Transgender man apparently.

[Message 5] Mark: Really? Damn.

[Message 6] Chloe: Awful. I was just there yesterday.

[Message 7] Sarah: Me too! Early morning though.

[Message 8] Mark: I saw Ben near the Public Restroom Mid-Morning yesterday. Anyone know if he knew 10. Social Worker?

[Message 9] Chloe: Ben? Isn't he the one with the Deep voice? What was he doing there?

[Message 10] Sarah: No idea. Ben's usually pretty quiet.

[Message 11] Mark: He looked kinda stressed.

[Message 12] Chloe: Stress can do crazy things to people.

[Message 13] Sarah: You thinking what I'm thinking?

[Message 14] Mark: Maybe?

[Message 15] Chloe: Don't jump to conclusions. Let's see what the cops find out.

[Message 16] Sarah: True. Though, didn’t Amy hate 10. Social Worker?

[Message 17] Mark: Amy? Why?

[Message 18] Sarah: Something about a promotion she didn’t get? She said she wanted to get rid of him.

[Message 19] Chloe: Wow, Amy... that’s messed up if she had something to do with this.

[Message 20] Mark: Yeah. Remember that romantic rival she had to eliminate?

[Message 21] Sarah: Of course, everyone does. Let the investigation roll first

[Message 22] Chloe: Okay, okay. Just saying, everyone has their issues.

[Message 23] Mark: Anyone else find it weird that the victim was strangled with a rope? It seems so... personal.

[Message 24] Sarah: Everything is weird about the situation.

[Message 25] Chloe: My cousin works near there. Said he saw someone matching Amy's description buying Strangulation with a rope at the store.

[Message 26] Mark: Seriously? A rope? That's... incriminating.

[Message 27] Sarah: She always looked like she had Sloping shoulders

[Message 28] Chloe: But she's got such a weak stature.

[Message 29] Mark: Amy is one cold women.

[Message 30] Sarah: Agreed.

[Message 31] Chloe: What's done is done. Hope they don't get the death penalty for this.

[Message 32] Mark: Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

[Message 33] Sarah: I hope they find out who did this. 10. Social Worker didn't deserve that.

[Message 34] Chloe: Agreed.

[Message 35] Mark: Anyone know what time it happened?

[Message 36] Sarah: Mid-Morning, apparently.

[Message 37] Chloe: That's when my cousin saw Amy at the store

[Message 38] Mark: Damn.

[Message 39] Sarah: This whole thing is just... unsettling.

[Message 40] Chloe: Tell me about it. Anyway, anyone up for pizza later? Needs a distraction.

[Message 41] Mark: I’m in.

[Message 42] Sarah: Count me in too.

[Message 43] Chloe: Great! 7pm at Luigi's?

[Message 44] Mark: Perfect.

[Message 45] Sarah: See you guys then.

[Message 46] Mark: Later.

[Message 47] Chloe: Bye!

[Message 48] Sarah: BTW, did anyone ever figure out who stole Mr. Henderson's cat?

[Message 49] Mark: Seriously, Sarah? Wrong time.

[Message 50] Chloe: Haha, Sarah! Always with the random stuff.

[Message 51] Sarah: Just trying to lighten the mood!

[Message 52] Mark: Mood's pretty light already. Thanks.

[Message 53] Chloe: Okay, back to the case. What do we know for sure?

[Message 54] Sarah: 10. Social Worker is dead, murdered at the Public Restroom.

[Message 55] Mark: Mid-Morning. Strangled.

[Message 56] Chloe: Amy might have bought the Strangulation with a rope.

[Message 57] Sarah: Ben was seen near the scene, looking stressed.

[Message 58] Mark: And Amy hated 10. Social Worker.

[Message 59] Chloe: Anyone know if 10. Social Worker had any enemies?

[Message 60] Sarah: I don't know the man.

[Message 61] Mark: No idea. Kept to himself, I heard.

[Message 62] Chloe: Well, this is all so depressing.

[Message 63] Sarah: Agreed.

[Message 64] Mark: Pizza will help.

[Message 65] Chloe: Definitely.

[Message 66] Sarah: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys. Remember that time Ben's motorcycle was stolen?

[Message 67] Mark: What does that have to do with anything, Sarah?

[Message 68] Chloe: Seriously?

[Message 69] Sarah: Just saying, maybe he's got a dark side we don't know about!

[Message 70] Mark: Everyone does. I also thought Ben always hated 10. Social Worker

[Message 71] Chloe: Maybe he intended to do it!

[Message 72] Sarah: Who knows...

[Message 73] Mark: Okay, pizza soon. Gotta go.

[Message 74] Chloe: Me too. See ya.

[Message 75] Sarah: Later!

[Message 76] Amy: Hey guys, heard the news?

[Message 77] Ben: Yeah, messed up.

[Message 78] Amy: I was near the Public Restroom Mid-Morning. Spooky.

[Message 79] Ben: Me too, actually. Weird.

[Message 80] Amy: So glad they got the killer.

[Message 81] Ben: They did? Who was it?

[Message 82] Amy: Haven't you heard? They found some hunchback posture person near the Public Restroom.

[Message 83] Ben: Oh, wow. Glad they caught them so fast.

[Message 84] Amy: Me too. Anyway, how's the motorcycle running, Ben?

[Message 85] Ben: Good as new, thanks for asking, Amy.

[Message 86] Amy: Glad to hear it.

[Message 87] Ben: This whole thing is giving me bad vibes.

[Message 88] Amy: Same. Let's just try to move on.

[Message 89] Ben: Agreed.

[Message 90] Amy: Hey, did you ever find out who took your tools last month?

[Message 91] Ben: No, not yet. Why?

[Message 92] Amy: Just curious.

[Message 93] Ben: Creepy thing is, I was looking up how to make Strangulation with a rope online around that time.

[Message 94] Amy: Haha, dark humor, Ben.

[Message 95] Ben: Wasnt a joke. I purposefully did.

[Message 96] Amy: Should be careful with those, Ben

[Message 97] Ben: I know, just saying. This whole thing is making me paranoid.

[Message 98] Amy: Me too. Anyway, gotta run. Talk later.

[Message 99] Ben: Later, Amy.

[Message 100] Chloe: Guys, I'm freaking out.

[Message 101] Mark: What's wrong, Chloe?

[Message 102] Chloe: My cousin just called. He said he might have misidentified Amy at the store.

[Message 103] Sarah: What?

[Message 104] Mark: So it wasn't her buying the Strangulation with a rope?

[Message 105] Chloe: He's not sure anymore. He said the person had a similar jacket, but...

[Message 106] Sarah: This is getting more confusing by the minute.

[Message 107] Mark: So much for that theory.

[Message 108] Chloe: I feel terrible. We were all so quick to judge.

[Message 109] Sarah: It's okay, Chloe. We were just going off what we heard.

[Message 110] Mark: Still, kinda unsettling that we were all so ready to believe it.

[Message 111] Chloe: True. Okay, new question: who benefits from 10. Social Worker's death?

[Message 112] Sarah: Good question.

[Message 113] Mark: Maybe Ben's motorcycle theft situation is more connected than we think. The timelines line up.

[Message 114] Chloe: Maybe someone who wanted Gaining control of a valuable asset?

[Message 115] Sarah: Someone who wanted to silence a witness?

[Message 116] Mark: We're back to square one.

[Message 117] Chloe: This sucks.

[Message 118] Sarah: Agreed.

[Message 119] Mark: Anyone have any other random details they've been holding back?

[Message 120] Chloe: Not me.

[Message 121] Sarah: Nope. Just that Mrs. Davis' prize-winning roses were stolen last week.

[Message 122] Mark: Seriously, Sarah?

[Message 123] Chloe: You're killing me.

[Message 124] Sarah: Just trying to lighten the mood! Again!

[Message 125] Mark: Maybe we should just leave it to the police.

[Message 126] Chloe: Probably a good idea.

[Message 127] Sarah: Fine, fine. But I still think the roses are suspicious.

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, crazy stuff. Some bartender got killed.
[Message 3] ANNA: I know, right? So messed up. Poor Jamie.
[Message 4] BEN: Jamie? Was that their name?
[Message 5] CHLOE: Yeah, Jamie. Worked there for like 2 years. Always smiling.
[Message 6] LIAM: Factory's gonna be closed for days. Anyone know what happened?
[Message 7] ANNA: Heard it was early morning. That's all I know.
[Message 8] BEN: Early morning? Before opening? Creepy.
[Message 9] CHLOE: I heard it was brutal.
[Message 10] LIAM: Seriously? Any details?
[Message 11] ANNA: Not saying, don't want to spread rumors.
[Message 12] BEN: Smart move, Anna. Let the cops handle it.
[Message 13] CHLOE: I'm just saying, be careful out there.
[Message 14] LIAM: Always am. So, movie night still on this weekend?
[Message 15] ANNA: Yeah, movie night is a go. Need some normalcy.
[Message 16] BEN: Sounds good to me. I'll bring the popcorn.
[Message 17] CHLOE: I'll bring drinks. Trying to think happy thoughts.
[Message 18] LIAM: This whole Jamie thing is awful.
[Message 19] ANNA: Agreed. Anyone know if they caught the person who did it?
[Message 20] BEN: Not yet, I think. Police are still investigating.
[Message 21] CHLOE: I saw Sarah leaving Factory around that time the other day. She looked really stressed.
[Message 22] LIAM: Sarah? The one with the unibrow?
[Message 23] ANNA: Yeah, Sarah. She works there too, right?
[Message 24] BEN: Yeah. What time was that, Chloe?
[Message 25] CHLOE: Early Morning. Like, just before sunrise. Around when it happened.
[Message 26] LIAM: Interesting...
[Message 27] ANNA: Maybe she just had to be there early.
[Message 28] BEN: Maybe. Or maybe she knows something.
[Message 29] CHLOE: Or maybe she did something… I don’t know. Just saying what I saw.
[Message 30] LIAM: I heard Jamie and Sarah didn’t get along.
[Message 31] ANNA: Where'd you hear that, Liam?
[Message 32] BEN: Yeah, spill the tea.
[Message 33] LIAM: Just around. Bartender talk. Sarah always seemed annoyed with Jamie's ""carefree"" attitude.
[Message 34] CHLOE: Jamie was always so nice to everyone though.
[Message 35] ANNA: Exactly! Hard to imagine anyone wanting to hurt them.
[Message 36] BEN: People are messed up, Anna. Don't be naive.
[Message 37] CHLOE: So true. Anyone see Mark around?
[Message 38] LIAM: Mark? You mean with the overbite?
[Message 39] ANNA: Yeah, haven't seen him lately. He’s been acting weird.
[Message 40] BEN: Weird how?
[Message 41] CHLOE: Just… quiet. And avoiding everyone.
[Message 42] LIAM: Maybe he's just dealing with something.
[Message 43] ANNA: Maybe. Or maybe he's involved somehow. He was talking about needing money badly last week.
[Message 44] BEN: Money troubles? That’s always a motive.
[Message 45] CHLOE: True. But still, it's hard to believe.
[Message 46] LIAM: So we have Sarah who had motive, and Mark who needed money.
[Message 47] ANNA: Let's not jump to conclusions. The police will figure it out.
[Message 48] BEN: Yeah, but it’s fun to speculate.
[Message 49] CHLOE: It's not fun, Ben. Someone is dead.
[Message 50] LIAM: Ben, chill. This is serious.
[Message 51] ANNA: Agreed. Respect for Jamie.
[Message 52] BEN: Sorry, guys. Didn't mean to be insensitive.
[Message 53] CHLOE: It’s ok. Just… let’s be mindful.
[Message 54] LIAM: So, movie night. Any suggestions?
[Message 55] ANNA: How about a comedy? We need to laugh.
[Message 56] BEN: I'm down. I'll bring extra popcorn.
[Message 57] CHLOE: Sounds good. I’m bringing wine.
[Message 58] LIAM: Perfect. This Jamie thing is stressing me out.
[Message 59] ANNA: Me too. Especially since they mentioned Asphyxiation by strangulation. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 60] BEN: Yeah, that's rough.
[Message 61] CHLOE: Makes you think. What if you were there? What would you do?
[Message 62] LIAM: Call the cops, obviously.
[Message 63] ANNA: Agreed. No question.
[Message 64] BEN: Depends on the situation.
[Message 65] CHLOE: What do you mean, Ben?
[Message 66] LIAM: Yeah, elaborate.
[Message 67] ANNA: That sounds suspicious.
[Message 68] BEN: Relax, guys. I just mean, if it was self-defense or something.
[Message 69] CHLOE: Self-defense against Jamie? Come on.
[Message 70] LIAM: Yeah, Jamie was harmless.
[Message 71] ANNA: Exactly. Ben, you’re being weird again.
[Message 72] BEN: I’m just saying… things aren’t always as they seem.
[Message 73] CHLOE: What are you implying?
[Message 74] LIAM: Seriously, Ben, you know something?
[Message 75] ANNA: Spill it. Now.
[Message 76] BEN: Ok, ok! Just… Mark told me Jamie owed him money.
[Message 77] CHLOE: Owed him money? For what?
[Message 78] LIAM: This is getting interesting.
[Message 79] ANNA: Mark never mentioned that to me.
[Message 80] BEN: Maybe he didn't want you to know.
[Message 81] CHLOE: So Mark needed money, and Jamie owed him money…
[Message 82] LIAM: And Jamie is now dead.
[Message 83] ANNA: Guys, this is serious. We need to tell the police.
[Message 84] BEN: I don’t want to get involved.
[Message 85] CHLOE: Ben! A person is dead!
[Message 86] LIAM: Agreed. Police need to know.
[Message 87] ANNA: We all go together. Ben, you're coming too.
[Message 88] BEN: Fine, fine. But I'm not saying anything else.
[Message 89] CHLOE: Just tell them what Mark said. That's all.
[Message 90] LIAM: And that Mark has been acting weird.
[Message 91] ANNA: Agreed. Let's go now.
[Message 92] BEN: Can we at least get the popcorn first?
[Message 93] CHLOE: Ben! Seriously?!
[Message 94] LIAM: Movie night is cancelled. Let’s go to the police station.
[Message 95] ANNA: Agreed. The sooner the better.
[Message 96] BEN: Fine. But I'm driving.
[Message 97] CHLOE: Whatever. Just get us there safely.
[Message 98] LIAM: Agreed. Let's go.
[Message 99] ANNA: This is insane. Poor Jamie.
[Message 100] BEN: I still can't believe this is happening.
[Message 101] CHLOE: Me neither. It's like a nightmare.
[Message 102] LIAM: Hopefully, they catch whoever did this soon.
[Message 103] ANNA: And they get what they deserve. Hope they don't get the death penalty.
[Message 104] BEN: Yeah. Long time in jail at least.
[Message 105] CHLOE: I heard someone saw Mark buying rope Asphyxiation by strangulation at the store last week. Is it true?
[Message 106] LIAM: Chloe, where did you hear that?
[Message 107] ANNA: That's a serious accusation.
[Message 108] BEN: Seriously, Chloe. You can't just say things like that.
[Message 109] CHLOE: I just overheard someone talking. I don't know if it's true or not.
[Message 110] LIAM: Well, don't spread rumors. That's how innocent people get hurt.
[Message 111] ANNA: Agreed. Chloe, be careful what you say.
[Message 112] BEN: This is getting out of hand.
[Message 113] CHLOE: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause trouble.
[Message 114] LIAM: It's okay. Just be mindful.
[Message 115] ANNA: Let's just focus on telling the police what we know.
[Message 116] BEN: Agreed. The less we speculate, the better.
[Message 117] CHLOE: Okay. Let's just go.
[Message 118] LIAM: Agreed. Ben, are you ready?
[Message 119] ANNA: Yeah, let's get this over with.
[Message 120] BEN: Almost. Just gotta grab my jacket.
[Message 121] CHLOE: Okay. Hurry up.
[Message 122] LIAM: We're waiting.
[Message 123] ANNA: Come on, Ben.
[Message 124] BEN: Okay, I'm here. Let's go.
[Message 125] CHLOE: Finally.
[Message 126] LIAM: Let's roll.
[Message 127] ANNA: This is so surreal.
[Message 128] BEN: Tell me about it.
[Message 129] CHLOE: I can't believe this is happening.
[Message 130] LIAM: Me neither.
[Message 131] ANNA: Poor Jamie deserved better.
[Message 132] BEN: Agreed.
[Message 133] CHLOE: Let's just hope justice is served.
[Message 134] LIAM: Agreed.
[Message 135] ANNA: I just want this to be over.
[Message 136] BEN: Me too.
[Message 137] CHLOE: We'll get through this together.
[Message 138] LIAM: Agreed.
[Message 139] ANNA: Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
[Message 140] BEN: Anytime.

[Message 20] Jamie: ""Don't know the details, Kai. Just heard it from a friend.""
[Message 21] River: ""Was it… violent?""
[Message 22] Alex: ""Probably. It's the Truck Stop.""
[Message 23] Kai: ""Violence is never the answer.""
[Message 24] Jamie: ""Agreed, Kai. Anyway, anyone hungry? Thinking of ordering pizza.""
[Message 25] River: ""Pizza sounds amazing.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""I'm in.""
[Message 27] Kai: ""Pepperoni for me! We must nourish our bodies.""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""Pepperoni it is. Alex, what do you want?""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Whatever.""
[Message 30] Jamie: ""Okay, one pepperoni, one 'whatever'. Coming right up.""
[Message 31] River: ""This Truck Stop thing is really bothering me.""
[Message 32] Kai: ""Me too, River. We must pray for the victims.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Prayers won't bring them back.""
[Message 34] Jamie: ""True, Alex. But it's the thought that counts, right?""
[Message 35] River: ""I guess so. Did they say who it was?""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Just some people.""
[Message 37] Kai: ""Some people? But who WERE they?""
[Message 38] Jamie: ""I think one was a woman. Young, maybe? ""
[Message 39] River: ""Oh god. That's so sad.""
[Message 40] Alex: ""Life is sad.""
[Message 41] Kai: ""We must find light in the darkness!""
[Message 42] Jamie: ""Okay, Kai. Deep breaths. Pizza's on its way.""
[Message 43] River: ""Thanks, Jamie. You're the best.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Yeah, thanks.""
[Message 45] Kai: ""Yes, thank you, Jamie.""
[Message 46] Jamie: ""No problem, guys. Just trying to keep spirits up.""
[Message 47] River: ""It's working a little.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""A little.""
[Message 49] Kai: ""Every little bit helps!""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""Exactly! Anyone got any good jokes?""
[Message 51] River: ""I'm terrible at jokes.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Me too.""
[Message 53] Kai: ""Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!""
[Message 54] Jamie: ""Haha, good one, Kai!""
[Message 55] River: ""Not bad, Kai.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""...okay.""
[Message 57] Jamie: ""Okay, pizza should be here in 15. Movie night after?""
[Message 58] River: ""Sounds fun!""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Sure.""
[Message 60] Kai: ""A movie sounds delightful! A wholesome one, please.""
[Message 61] Jamie: ""Of course, Kai. Nothing too scary.""
[Message 62] River: ""Did anyone know them? The people at the Truck Stop?""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Don't think so.""
[Message 64] Kai: ""I didn't. I mostly stay to myself.""
[Message 65] Jamie: ""Me neither. Truck Stop isn't really my scene.""
[Message 66] River: ""Yeah, same.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""...""
[Message 68] Jamie: ""Alex? You okay? You're being awfully quiet.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Headache.""
[Message 70] River: ""Oh no! Maybe you should skip the movie.""
[Message 71] Kai: ""Yes, rest is important! We must nurture our bodies and minds.""
[Message 72] Jamie: ""Yeah, Alex, take care of yourself. We can always watch it another time.""
[Message 73] Alex: ""I'm fine.""
[Message 74] Jamie: ""Okay, if you say so. Pizza's here!""
[Message 75] River: ""Yay!""
[Message 76] Kai: ""Pizza time!""
[Message 77] Alex: ""...""
[Message 78] Jamie: ""Come on, Alex, pizza will make you feel better.""
[Message 79] River: ""Yeah, Alex, come eat!""
[Message 80] Kai: ""Food is a gift from above!""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Coming.""
[Message 82] Jamie: ""Great! So, did anyone see the news about that protest downtown?""
[Message 83] River: ""Yeah, looked pretty intense.""
[Message 84] Alex: ""Pointless.""
[Message 85] Kai: ""Protests are important for voicing our opinions!""
[Message 86] Jamie: ""True, Kai. But sometimes they get out of hand.""
[Message 87] River: ""Definitely. There's always a better way.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""Is there?""
[Message 89] Kai: ""Love and understanding are always the answer!""
[Message 90] Jamie: ""Okay, Kai. Ease up on the positivity for a sec, this pizza is amazing.""
[Message 91] River: ""Seriously! This is the best pizza I've had in ages.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""It's pizza.""
[Message 93] Jamie: ""Okay, Mr. Grumpy. More for us then.""
[Message 94] River: ""Heard the victims names are Sal and Marie.""
[Message 95] Kai: ""Sal and Marie… May their souls rest in peace.""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Marie… I think I knew a Marie.""
[Message 97] Jamie: ""Really, Alex? How?""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Just an acquaintance. Long time ago.""
[Message 99] River: ""Small world, I guess.""
[Message 100] Kai: ""Everything is connected!""
[Message 101] Jamie: ""So, movie after this, right? What are we thinking?""
[Message 102] River: ""I'm up for anything!""
[Message 103] Alex: ""Doesn't matter.""
[Message 104] Kai: ""Something with a happy ending, please!""
[Message 105] Jamie: ""Got it, Kai. Happy endings only. Okay, I'm going to clear this up. Be right back.""
[Message 106] River: ""Sounds good!""
[Message 107] Alex: ""...""
[Message 108] Kai: ""Alex, are you feeling alright?""
[Message 109] Alex: ""Fine.""
[Message 110] River: ""You seem really quiet and down.""
[Message 111] Alex: ""Just tired.""
[Message 112] Kai: ""We must listen to our bodies!""
[Message 113] Jamie: ""Okay, I'm back. So, movie time! Any preferences?""
[Message 114] River: ""Something funny?""
[Message 115] Alex: ""...""
[Message 116] Kai: ""A comedy would be lovely!""
[Message 117] Jamie: ""Comedy it is! I'll find something on Netflix.""
[Message 118] River: ""Awesome!""
[Message 119] Alex: ""I’m going to lie down.""
[Message 120] Kai: ""Rest well, Alex!""
[Message 121] Jamie: ""Yeah, get some rest, Alex. We’ll be here.""
[Message 122] River: ""Feel better!""
[Message 123] Alex: ""Whatever.""
[Message 124] Jamie: ""Okay, well, River and I are going to watch a movie. You sure you don't want anything, Alex?""
[Message 125] River: ""Yeah, we can save you some pizza!""
[Message 126] Kai: ""We shall pray for your speedy recovery!""
[Message 127] Alex: ""No.""
[Message 128] Jamie: ""Alright then. Movie time!""
[Message 129] River: ""Yay! What are we watching?""
[Message 130] Jamie: ""I found a Jim Carrey movie. Seemed appropriate.""
[Message 131] River: ""Perfect! He always makes me laugh.""
[Message 132] Kai: ""Laughter is the best medicine!""
[Message 133] Jamie: ""Exactly, Kai! Alright, let's do this.""
[Message 134] River: ""Movie time!""
[Message 135] Jamie: ""This is a nice distraction, after hearing about Sal and Marie. I hope they catch whoever did it. They're going away for a long time for this. ""
[Message 136] River: ""Me too. It's just so senseless.""
[Message 137] Kai: ""Justice will prevail! It always does!""
[Message 138] Jamie: ""Hope so. Anyone know what kind of golf club was used?""
[Message 139] River: ""Golf club? How do you know that?""
[Message 140] Jamie: ""Just heard it from someone else. That the Hitting with a golf club was found nearby.""
[Message 141] River: ""That's terrible.""
[Message 142] Kai: ""Violence using any object is wrong!""
[Message 143] Jamie: ""Yeah, no kidding, Kai. Just trying to figure this whole thing out. Seems like Sal and Marie meant a lot to people. Heard Marie shouting ""I was aware! I was aware"" before passing away. Did she try to say who did it?""
[Message 144] River: ""I don't know, Jamie. Why are you so focused on the details?""
[Message 145] Jamie: ""Just curious, River. Don't get your feathers ruffled.""
[Message 146] Kai: ""Curiosity is a dangerous thing!""
[Message 147] Jamie: ""Maybe, Kai. But sometimes it's necessary.""
[Message 148] River: ""I'm going to go to bed. This whole conversation is making me uncomfortable.""
[Message 149] Jamie: ""Okay, River. Sleep well.""
[Message 150] Kai: ""May your dreams be peaceful!""
[Message 151] River: ""Thanks. Goodnight.""
[Message 152] Jamie: ""Goodnight.""
[Message 153] Kai: ""Goodnight, River.""
[Message 154] Jamie: ""Well, Kai, looks like it's just you and me now.""
[Message 155] Kai: ""Indeed, Jamie. What shall we do?""
[Message 156] Jamie: ""I think I'll turn in too. This whole day has been a bit much.""
[Message 157] Kai: ""Agreed. The events at the Truck Stop have weighed heavily on my heart.""
[Message 158] Jamie: ""Yeah, me too. Goodnight, Kai.""
[Message 159] Kai: ""Goodnight, Jamie. May the light guide your way.""
[Message 160] Jamie: ""Thanks, Kai.""
[Message 161] Jamie: ""I saw Alex at the store earlier buying a Hitting with a golf club. Said he needed it for golfing. Guess it might be a red herring.""
[Message 162] Kai: ""That's quite odd.""
[Message 163] Jamie: ""Yeah, I didn't think he was much of a golfer.""
[Message 164] Jamie: ""Remember that time you saw Alex leaving the building right when the sunset? That was the day of the murders, right?""
[Message 165] Kai: ""Yes, I did see him leave then.""
[Message 166] Jamie: ""Interesting.""
[Message 167] Jamie: ""Hey Kai? If someone did something terrible, do you think they should confess, or try to hide it? Maybe Marie's death was not an intervening cause, but they failed to call 911 after she was hurt, making the harm worse.""
[Message 168] Kai: ""Confession is good for the soul! Honesty is always the best policy!""
[Message 169] Jamie: ""Even if it means going to jail for life?""
[Message 170] Kai: ""Justice must be served, regardless of the consequences!""
[Message 171] Jamie: ""Right. I'm going to try to sleep. Goodnight, Kai.""
[Message 172] Kai: ""Goodnight, Jamie. May your conscience be clear.""
[Message 173] Jamie: ""...""
[Message 174] Kai: ""...""
[Message 175] Jamie: ""You still up, Kai?""
[Message 176] Kai: ""I am, Jamie. My mind is troubled.""
[Message 177] Jamie: ""Mine too. That talk about confession... It's heavy.""
[Message 178] Kai: ""Indeed. We must all strive to be better people.""
[Message 179] Jamie: ""Yeah. Goodnight, Kai. Really this time.""
[Message 180] Kai: ""Goodnight, Jamie. Peace be with you.""

6. Ensure all victims are mentioned by name or role (e.g., ""the manager"") at least once in the conversation.
7. **Incorporate at least 3 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Dawn"", ""She was buying Stabbing with a knife at the store"").
        *   **Mens Rea:** Hints at the suspects' state of mind, intent, or knowledge (e.g., ""He always hated 8.  Judge"", ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""). Use words like ""intended,"" ""knew,"" ""aware,"" ""purposefully"".

8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

[Message 1] Alex: ""Hey Riley, you up?""
[Message 2] Riley: ""Yeah, insomnia hitting hard. What's up?""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Did you hear about what happened at the Pharmacy?""
[Message 4] Riley: ""No, what? Another robbery?""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Worse. Two people dead. Judge Thompson and some cop. At dawn.""
[Message 6] Riley: ""WHAT?! Judge Thompson? I knew her! That's insane.""
[Message 7] Riley: ""Who was the cop?""
[Message 8] Alex: ""Officer Miller, I think. Fresh out of the academy. Tragic.""
[Message 9] Jordan: ""OMG, I just saw the news. So messed up.""
[Message 10] Jordan: ""Alex, were you anywhere near there this morning? I know you sometimes grab coffee before work near that Pharmacy.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Jordan, seriously? I was home, asleep. Don't even joke about that.""
[Message 12] Jordan: ""Sorry, sorry. Just freaked out. This whole thing is crazy. Hope they catch whoever did it. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 13] Riley: ""Yeah, no kidding. What kind of monster...""
[Message 14] Alex: ""They said it was a stabbing. Brutal.""
[Message 15] Riley: ""Did they say anything about a motive?""
[Message 16] Alex: ""Robbery gone wrong, maybe? That's what the early reports are saying.""
[Message 17] Jordan: ""Maybe someone Judge Thompson pissed off? She was known to be Cynical""
[Message 18] Riley: ""Or a cop hater targeting Miller? This is Dallas, after all.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""True. So many possibilities.""
[Message 20] Riley: ""I feel sick. I need to get off my phone. Let me know if you hear anything else.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Will do. Try to get some sleep.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""Me too. Night, guys.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Night.""
[Message 24] Jordan: ""Hey Alex, did you ever find that Stabbing with a knife you were looking for online? You said you wanted to start cooking more.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Seriously, Jordan? Now is not the time. And I was looking at chef's knives, not... that. Jeez.""
[Message 26] Jordan: ""Okay, okay. Just asking. Sorry.""
[Message 27] Riley: ""Guys, can we just please not talk about this anymore tonight?""
[Message 28] Alex: ""Agreed. Chat later.""
[Message 29] Jordan: ""Later.""
[Message 30] Alex: ""Riley, you still up?""
[Message 31] Riley: ""Yeah, unfortunately. What is it?""
[Message 32] Alex: ""Something's bothering me about Jordan's questions. Seemed…off.""
[Message 33] Riley: ""Yeah, I noticed that too. Maybe they're just in shock and not thinking straight.""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Maybe. But I saw Jordan leave the building at Dawn yesterday. Don't know why he was there.""
[Message 35] Riley: ""Wait, really? You saw Jordan? That's weird. Did you say anything?""
[Message 36] Alex: ""No, I was across the street and didn't want to bother him if he was busy. Thought he was grabbing food or something.""
[Message 37] Riley: ""Hmm. Keep me posted if you remember anything else.""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Will do.""
[Message 39] Jordan: ""Hey guys, I can't shake this feeling. This city is going to hell.""
[Message 40] Riley: ""Tell me about it. Makes you wonder if anything is safe anymore.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Exactly. Makes me want to move.""
[Message 42] Jordan: ""Seriously considering it. Maybe Montana.""
[Message 43] Riley: ""Montana? That's random.""
[Message 44] Jordan: ""Fresh air, fewer crazies. Just a thought.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""I've always wanted to visit. Never thought about living there.""
[Message 46] Riley: ""Well, let's solve this crime first before we all run off to Montana.""
[Message 47] Jordan: ""Easier said than done, Riley. The cops probably have no leads.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""You seem pretty sure about that, Jordan. You got inside information?""
[Message 49] Jordan: ""What? No! Just saying, crime is up everywhere. They're stretched thin.""
[Message 50] Riley: ""He's got a point, Alex.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Maybe. Still feels weird.""
[Message 52] Jordan: ""Okay, now you're making me paranoid. I'm going to bed. Goodnight.""
[Message 53] Riley: ""Night.""
[Message 54] Alex: ""Night.""
[Message 55] Riley: ""Alex, you still awake?""
[Message 56] Alex: ""Yep. Still thinking about this. Judge Thompson always hated people.""
[Message 57] Riley: ""Me too. This is eating at me.""
[Message 58] Alex: ""I just remembered something else about yesterday morning...""
[Message 59] Riley: ""What?""
[Message 60] Alex: ""I saw Jordan talking to a guy I've never seen before, near the Pharmacy. They looked like they were arguing.""
[Message 61] Riley: ""Did you get a good look at the guy?""
[Message 62] Alex: ""Not really. Tall, kinda hunched over. That's about it.""
[Message 63] Riley: ""Hunched over... that's not much to go on.""
[Message 64] Alex: ""I know. But the arguing part…maybe it’s nothing.""
[Message 65] Riley: ""Maybe. But it's worth remembering. We should tell the police about this.""
[Message 66] Alex: ""I don't know... what if I'm wrong? I don't want to get Jordan in trouble if he's innocent.""
[Message 67] Riley: ""True. Let's sit on it for a bit. See if anything else comes to light.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Agreed.""
[Message 69] Jordan: ""Morning, guys. Feeling any better about things?""
[Message 70] Riley: ""Not really. Just trying to stay positive.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Same here. Trying to focus on work.""
[Message 72] Jordan: ""Yeah, gotta keep busy. Distraction is key.""
[Message 73] Riley: ""Did you guys see the updated news report? They said Officer Miller's family is devastated. He was only 18.""
[Message 74] Alex: ""That's awful. So young.""
[Message 75] Jordan: ""Tragic. Makes you wonder what the world is coming to.""
[Message 76] Riley: ""I saw on Facebook someone saying Judge Thompson was about to rule on a big case that could have made some enemies.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""That's possible. She was a tough Judge.""
[Message 78] Jordan: ""See? Plenty of motives. Could be anyone.""
[Message 79] Riley: ""Anyone who had access to the pharmacy that early, anyway.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Good point.""
[Message 81] Jordan: ""You think they'll release the security footage?""
[Message 82] Riley: ""Eventually, probably. But it could take a while.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Maybe the security footage will show that Jordan was there before it happened.""
[Message 84] Jordan: ""Why are you so obsessed with me being there, Alex? I was just getting a prescription filled. I'm trying to get notorious!""
[Message 85] Riley: ""Whoa, chill out, guys. No need to get defensive.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Sorry, Jordan. Just on edge.""
[Message 87] Jordan: ""Easy for you to say. You're not the one being interrogated via text.""
[Message 88] Riley: ""Guys, seriously, let's just drop it. This isn't helping anyone.""
[Message 89] Alex: ""Okay, okay. My bad.""
[Message 90] Jordan: ""Yeah, whatever.""
[Message 91] Riley: ""Anyway, I was thinking about volunteering at a homeless shelter this weekend. Need to do something positive.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""That's a good idea, Riley. Maybe I'll join you.""
[Message 93] Jordan: ""I'm busy, but good for you guys.""
[Message 94] Riley: ""Okay, well, if you change your mind, let us know.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""Yeah, the more the merrier.""
[Message 96] Jordan: ""Whatever.""
[Message 97] Riley: ""Alex, can I ask you something in private?""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Sure, go ahead.""
[Message 99] Riley: ""*Private chat* I'm really starting to think Jordan knows more than he's letting on. All the defensiveness…""
[Message 100] Alex: ""*Private chat* I know, right? Especially the ""I'm trying to get notorious!"" comment. What was that about?""
[Message 101] Riley: ""*Private chat* Exactly! And him being at the Pharmacy at Dawn… I’m really worried.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""*Private chat* Me too. But we still don't have proof of anything. Just a bad feeling.""
[Message 103] Riley: ""*Private chat* We need to be careful. Maybe we should talk to the police anonymously.""
[Message 104] Alex: ""*Private chat* That's probably the best idea. Let's do that tomorrow.""
[Message 105] Riley: ""*Private chat* Agreed. Night.""
[Message 106] Alex: ""*Private chat* Night.""
[Message 107] Jordan: ""Hey, Riley.""
[Message 108] Riley: ""Hey, Jordan. What's up?""
[Message 109] Jordan: ""I'm sorry I snapped earlier. Just stressed about everything. The media are saying that it was a purposeful act, and I just wish they would leave people alone.""
[Message 110] Riley: ""I get it. It's a lot to process.""
[Message 111] Jordan: ""Yeah. I also wanted to ask… what did you and Alex talk about privately?""
[Message 112] Riley: ""Oh, just about the volunteer thing. Nothing important.""
[Message 113] Jordan: ""Oh, okay. Seemed like you guys were whispering about something.""
[Message 114] Riley: ""Just girl talk. You know how it is.""
[Message 115] Jordan: ""Right, right. Well, I'm going to try and get some sleep. Hopefully, things will be better tomorrow.""
[Message 116] Riley: ""Yeah, let's hope so. Goodnight.""
[Message 117] Jordan: ""Night.""
[Message 118] Alex: ""Riley, are you awake?""
[Message 119] Riley: ""Yeah, just barely. What's wrong?""
[Message 120] Alex: ""Jordan just texted me asking what we talked about privately. He's totally suspicious.""
[Message 121] Riley: ""I know! He asked me too. I told him it was nothing.""
[Message 122] Alex: ""He's definitely trying to figure out if we suspect him. We need to be careful.""
[Message 123] Riley: ""I agree. Let's call the anonymous tip line first thing in the morning.""
[Message 124] Alex: ""Okay, deal. This is getting too intense.""
[Message 125] Riley: ""I know. I can't wait for this to be over.""
[Message 126] Alex: ""Me neither. Try to get some sleep. We'll talk tomorrow.""
[Message 127] Riley: ""Goodnight, Alex.""
[Message 128] Alex: ""Goodnight, Riley.""
[Message 129] Jordan: ""You guys think I am the killer? It was not me!""
[Message 130] Jordan: ""Answer me!""

[Message 106] Noah: ""I'm still searching for more articles. This is taking a while.""

8.  **Consider Punishment:** In at least one message, directly or indirectly reference the potential consequences or severity of the crime (e.g., ""They're going away for a long time for this"", ""Hope they don't get the death penalty"").

[Message 4] LIAM: ""Mark? Wow. He always seemed pretty chill.""
[Message 5] AVERY: ""I heard about it too. Absolutely devastating. Especially for their families.""

[Message 7] LIAM: ""Makes you think what, exactly?""
[Message 8] CHLOE: ""Just... about life, death, everything. You know.""
[Message 9] AVERY: ""I can't believe someone would do that. It feels… purposeful.""
[Message 10] LIAM: ""Purposeful? What do you mean, Avery?""
[Message 11] AVERY: ""I don't know. The news said it was… violent. Not just random.""
[Message 12] CHLOE: ""Did they say how?""
[Message 13] LIAM: ""They're not releasing details, Chloe. Just that the manager found them this morning when they opened. Sunrise.""
[Message 14] CHLOE: ""Sunrise? That's rough. Someone was up early. Or never went to bed.""
[Message 15] AVERY: ""I can't sleep. This whole thing is giving me nightmares.""
[Message 16] LIAM: ""Nightmares? You okay, Avery?""
[Message 17] AVERY: ""Yeah, just… shaken. It’s just terrible that such a thing could happen to Dana. She was so ambitious.""
[Message 18] CHLOE: ""I agree. That's awful for her.""
[Message 19] LIAM: ""Hey, anyone seen Sarah lately? She was supposed to cover my shift yesterday but didn't show.""
[Message 20] CHLOE: ""Sarah? No, I haven't. Weird.""
[Message 21] AVERY: ""I think Sarah was working there last week. She didn’t mention she was still on the schedule.""
[Message 22] LIAM: ""That is odd. She needed the money. I hope she's okay.""
[Message 23] CHLOE: ""Maybe she knew Mark? I feel like she would get along with someone optimistic""
[Message 24] AVERY: ""Maybe. It's probably nothing. Just… bad timing.""
[Message 25] LIAM: ""True. People skip shifts all the time. Still, kinda worrying, right?""
[Message 26] CHLOE: ""Yeah, a little. Especially now. Let’s just try not to jump to conclusions.""
[Message 27] AVERY: ""Definitely. We should focus on supporting the community. Maybe organize something in memory of Mark and Dana?""
[Message 28] LIAM: ""That's a good idea, Avery. I'm in.""
[Message 29] CHLOE: ""Me too. Let's talk details later.""
[Message 30] LIAM: ""Hey, Avery, you were pretty close to the coffee shop, right? Did you see anything strange last night or early this morning?""
[Message 31] AVERY: ""I didn't see anything, Liam. Why?""
[Message 32] LIAM: ""Just curious. The cops are probably asking everyone around there.""
[Message 33] AVERY: ""Oh, okay. Well, no. I was up late studying. Really focused. If I had noticed anything I would call 911.""
[Message 34] CHLOE: ""What are you studying, Avery?""
[Message 35] AVERY: ""Just… history. A really intense course. I wish I could go back in time and change all of it.""

[Message 37] CHLOE: ""Oh god, that's horrible. Who would do something like that?""
[Message 38] AVERY: ""I just can’t imagine the pain they went through. I hope they catch the person responsible and they go away for a long time for this.""
[Message 39] LIAM: ""Me too. Whoever did this deserves the worst.""

[Message 41] LIAM: ""A knife set? Chloe, don't start rumors.""
[Message 42] CHLOE: ""I'm not! I just remembered seeing it. It's probably nothing.""
[Message 43] AVERY: ""That's quite a coincidence, Chloe. But I agree with Liam, jumping to conclusions helps nobody.""
[Message 44] LIAM: ""Guys, let’s not accuse Sarah. Let the police handle it. Anyway, anyone know if Mark had any enemies?""
[Message 45] CHLOE: ""As drug dealers. I believe that he does.""
[Message 46] AVERY: ""Drug Dealer probably makes you a lot of enemies.""
[Message 47] LIAM: ""True. Makes you wonder if someone finally got tired of him.""
[Message 48] CHLOE: ""But what about Dana? Why would anyone hurt her?""
[Message 49] AVERY: ""Maybe she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. If she had stayed home, maybe none of this would have happened.""
[Message 50] LIAM: ""Yeah, tragic. So, back to Sarah… anyone have her number? I want to make sure she's okay.""
[Message 51] CHLOE: ""I do. I'll text her. But honestly, I'm kinda scared to. What if...?""
[Message 52] AVERY: ""What if what, Chloe?""
[Message 53] CHLOE: ""Nothing. Never mind. Let's just hope she's alright. I intend to know the reason for this.""
[Message 54] LIAM: ""Agreed. Hope the cops figure this out soon. I'm going crazy just thinking about it.""
[Message 55] AVERY: ""Me too. Let's just try to support each other through this. We should all be aware of the possible dangers in Tampa.""

[Message 2] Noah: What? Spill!
[Message 3] Liam: 7.  Activist is dead. Found in their office.
[Message 4] Noah: WHAT?! Seriously? How?
[Message 5] Liam: Not sure, cops are everywhere. It's insane.
[Message 6] Chloe: Did you hear about 7.  Activist? This is unreal.
[Message 7] Liam: Yeah, Chloe, it's all anyone's talking about. You okay? You seemed close to them.
[Message 8] Chloe: I am NOT okay. They were my friend. I can't believe this.
[Message 9] Noah: Chloe, I'm so sorry. That's awful.
[Message 10] Liam: Did you see anything weird today, Chloe? Anything at all?
[Message 11] Chloe: No! Why would you ask me that?
[Message 12] Liam: Just, you know, trying to piece things together.
[Message 13] Noah: Lay off her, Liam. She's grieving.
[Message 14] Liam: Sorry, sorry. Just…shocked.
[Message 15] Chloe: I need some time to process this.
[Message 16] Noah: Of course, Chloe. We're here for you.
[Message 17] Liam: Seriously. Anything you need.
[Message 18] Chloe: Thanks.
[Message 19] Noah: Hey, Liam, remember that guy, Ash, who was always complaining about 7.  Activist?
[Message 20] Liam: Yeah, vaguely. What about him?
[Message 21] Noah: I saw Ash leave the building around Midday. Looked kinda flustered.
[Message 22] Liam: Really? Midday? That's when it happened, right?
[Message 23] Noah: That’s what I heard.
[Message 24] Liam: I saw Ash buying Asphyxiation by strangulation a few days ago. Coincidence?
[Message 25] Noah: That's messed up, Liam. You should tell the cops.
[Message 26] Liam: Maybe… it's probably nothing. Don't want to jump to conclusions.
[Message 27] Noah: Better safe than sorry, man.
[Message 28] Chloe: Leave Ash alone. He wouldn’t do something like that.
[Message 29] Liam: How do you know, Chloe?
[Message 30] Chloe: I just… I know him. He's not violent.
[Message 31] Noah: Everyone's capable of anything under the right circumstances.
[Message 32] Liam: True.
[Message 33] Chloe: This is all so horrible. Did they say how it happened?
[Message 34] Liam: Not officially. Rumor is Asphyxiation by strangulation.
[Message 35] Chloe: Oh god.
[Message 36] Noah: That’s brutal.
[Message 37] Liam: Hey, you guys free for pizza tonight? Need to take my mind off this.
[Message 38] Noah: Sure, I'm in. Chloe?
[Message 39] Chloe: I can't. Thanks though.
[Message 40] Liam: Okay. Another time.
[Message 41] Noah: Yeah, Chloe, take care of yourself.
[Message 42] Chloe: I will.
[Message 43] Liam: So, pizza at my place at 7?
[Message 44] Noah: Sounds good.
[Message 45] Chloe: I keep thinking about what 7.  Activist was working on. They were getting close to exposing some shady stuff with the company.
[Message 46] Liam: Shady stuff? What kind of shady stuff?
[Message 47] Chloe: I don't know specifics, but it was about the company funds being misused.
[Message 48] Noah: That could be a motive for someone, right?
[Message 49] Liam: Definitely. Someone at the top, maybe?
[Message 50] Chloe: Maybe. Or someone who was going to get caught up in it.
[Message 51] Noah: Did 7.  Activist mention anyone in particular?
[Message 52] Chloe: No, they were being really careful. Said they didn't want to put anyone at risk.
[Message 53] Liam: Smart.
[Message 54] Noah: I remember Ash was talking about hurting 7.  Activist right before he went over there.
[Message 55] Chloe: Stop it, Noah! You're making things up.
[Message 56] Noah: I'm just saying what I heard.
[Message 57] Liam: Calm down, guys. Let's not accuse anyone without proof.
[Message 58] Chloe: Exactly!
[Message 59] Liam: Anyway, pizza at 7. See you then, Noah.
[Message 60] Noah: See ya.
[Message 61] Chloe: I can't believe you guys are just going to eat pizza after this.
[Message 62] Liam: What else are we supposed to do, Chloe? We can't bring 7.  Activist back.
[Message 63] Chloe: I don't know. Mourn, maybe?
[Message 64] Noah: We are mourning, Chloe. But life goes on.
[Message 65] Chloe: Whatever.
[Message 66] Liam: Look, I'm sorry you're upset. We'll talk later, okay?
[Message 67] Chloe: Fine.
[Message 68] Noah: So, you think it was someone at the dealership?
[Message 69] Liam: It's possible. Or maybe someone 7.  Activist knew outside of work.
[Message 70] Noah: True. They were an activist, right? Probably made some enemies.
[Message 71] Liam: Yeah, could be anything.
[Message 72] Noah: I heard the cops are looking into the manager, David.
[Message 73] Liam: David? Why?
[Message 74] Noah: Apparently, he and 7.  Activist had a huge argument last week.
[Message 75] Liam: About what?
[Message 76] Noah: No idea. But it was loud. Everyone heard it.
[Message 77] Liam: Interesting.
[Message 78] Noah: Maybe he fired 7.  Activist, and that’s why none of this would have happened.
[Message 79] Liam: Could be. He's always seemed like a jerk.
[Message 80] Noah: Yeah, he's definitely got a temper.
[Message 81] Liam: Speaking of tempers, remember how mad Ash got when 7.  Activist wouldn't go out with him?
[Message 82] Noah: Oh yeah! He was obsessed.
[Message 83] Liam: ""She said she wanted to get rid of him."" - Direct quote from Ash a few weeks ago.
[Message 84] Noah: Dude, you should tell the cops that.
[Message 85] Liam: I know, I know. Just… processing.
[Message 86] Noah: Alright. See you at 7.
[Message 87] Liam: Later.
[Message 88] Chloe: So you're really just going to throw Ash under the bus?
[Message 89] Liam: I'm not throwing anyone under the bus, Chloe. I'm just stating facts.
[Message 90] Chloe: Those aren't facts! You're twisting things.
[Message 91] Liam: What do you mean?
[Message 92] Chloe: You know what I mean. You’re just trying to pin this on him.
[Message 93] Liam: Why would I do that?
[Message 94] Chloe: Because you’re jealous of him!
[Message 95] Liam: Jealous? Of Ash? That's ridiculous.
[Message 96] Chloe: Is it? You always liked 7.  Activist, too.
[Message 97] Liam: What does that have to do with anything?
[Message 98] Chloe: Maybe you intended for this to happen. Maybe you saw 7.  Activist as a rival too.
[Message 99] Liam: That's insane, Chloe!
[Message 100] Chloe: Is it?
[Message 101] Liam: I'm done with this conversation.
[Message 102] Chloe: Yeah, run away.
[Message 103] Liam: Unbelievable.
[Message 104] Noah: Hey, pizza's here. You on your way?
[Message 105] Liam: Yeah, be there in 5.
[Message 106] Noah: Cool. So, about Ash... do you think he's really capable of this?
[Message 107] Liam: I don't know, man. I honestly don't. But that comment about getting rid of them…
[Message 108] Noah: I know, that's pretty damning. Especially since he was looking up how to make Asphyxiation by strangulation online before it happened.
[Message 109] Liam: Wait, what? How do you know that?
[Message 110] Noah: A friend works at the library. Said Ash was on their computers a few days ago.
[Message 111] Liam: Holy crap.
[Message 112] Noah: Hope they don't get the death penalty
[Message 113] Liam: Yeah, well… if he did it, he deserves whatever he gets.
[Message 114] Noah: True.
[Message 115] Liam: Coming up.
[Message 116] Noah: Alright.
[Message 117] Chloe: You guys are really making a mistake.
[Message 118] Liam: What do you mean?
[Message 119] Chloe: You're focusing on the wrong person.
[Message 120] Liam: Who should we be focusing on then, Chloe? You seem to know so much.
[Message 121] Chloe: Maybe you should look closer to home.
[Message 122] Liam: What's that supposed to mean?
[Message 123] Chloe: Just think about it. Who benefits the most from 7.  Activist's death?
[Message 124] Liam: I have no idea.
[Message 125] Chloe: Think about the money.
[Message 126] Liam: Okay, now you're just being cryptic.
[Message 127] Chloe: Maybe. Or maybe I'm trying to protect someone.
[Message 128] Liam: Protect someone who killed 7.  Activist?
[Message 129] Chloe: I didn't say that.
[Message 130] Liam: You heavily implied it.
[Message 131] Chloe: Just think about it, Liam. Before you ruin someone's life.
[Message 132] Liam: I will. But you need to be straight with us, Chloe. If you know something, you have to tell the police.
[Message 133] Chloe: I can't.
[Message 134] Liam: Why not?
[Message 135] Chloe: Because I can't. Just… trust me.
[Message 136] Liam: I don't know if I can.
[Message 137] Chloe: Fine.
[Message 138] Liam: Look, I'm leaving for Noah's. We can talk more later if you want.
[Message 139] Chloe: Whatever.
[Message 140] Liam: See ya.
[Message 141] Noah: Everything okay with Chloe? She seems really upset.
[Message 142] Liam: Yeah, she's convinced we're wrong about Ash.
[Message 143] Noah: And you're not?
[Message 144] Liam: I don't know what to think anymore.
[Message 145] Noah: Well, let's just try to enjoy the pizza and not talk about it anymore tonight.
[Message 146] Liam: Good plan.
[Message 147] Noah: Cheers.
[Message 148] Liam: Cheers.
[Message 149] Chloe: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 150] Liam: What do you mean Chloe? You there?
[Message 151] Chloe: The manager, David. He knew.

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, Chloe. Crazy day. You wouldn't believe it.
[Message 3] Chloe: What happened? Everything alright with you?
[Message 4] Liam: I'm fine. It's… it's Ms. Evelyn Reed. She's… gone.
[Message 5] Chloe: Evelyn? What do you mean 'gone'? What happened to the 1.  Law Enforcement Officer?
[Message 6] Liam: I can't really talk about it. Just… tragic accident.
[Message 7] Chloe: Accident? The police were everywhere! That doesn’t sound like an accident.
[Message 8] Liam: Look, I gotta go. Meetings. It’s hectic.
[Message 9] Chloe: Liam, wait! Did you see anything?
[Message 10] Liam: I saw everyone in shock. That's all. Talk later.
[Message 11] Sarah: Chloe, have you heard anything about what happened to Evelyn?
[Message 12] Chloe: Just bits and pieces from Liam. Sounds bad. Did you know her well?
[Message 13] Sarah: We chatted sometimes. She was… direct. Knew how to get things done.
[Message 14] Chloe: Direct is an understatement. Some people didn't like how she handled things. Remember that argument with Dana last month?
[Message 15] Sarah: Vaguely. Dana gets heated easily. What a horrible day.
[Message 16] Chloe: Agreed. I hope they figure out what happened quickly.
[Message 17] Dana: Hey Sarah, you at home? I need to vent.
[Message 18] Sarah: Yeah, come over. Everyone's shaken up about Evelyn.
[Message 19] Dana: I know, right? I can't believe it. About Evelyn.
[Message 20] Liam: Hey Chloe, sorry I bailed earlier. Things are insane here.
[Message 21] Chloe: It's okay. I understand. Has anyone mentioned anything about a political assassination?
[Message 22] Liam: Political what now? Chloe, what are you talking about? Where are you getting that from?
[Message 23] Chloe: Just something I read. Forget it.
[Message 24] Liam: Good. Because that's crazy. It's just a tragedy.
[Message 25] Sarah: Dana's here. We're talking about everything. It's rough.
[Message 26] Chloe: Is Dana okay? She seemed really stressed lately.
[Message 27] Sarah: She's upset, but holding it together. Says she saw Evelyn this morning.
[Message 28] Dana: Saw her yelling at Carl, actually. Right before I left for my meeting.
[Message 29] Sarah: What were they arguing about?
[Message 30] Dana: No idea. Carl looked furious. I thought he was going to hit her.
[Message 31] Chloe: Carl? Really? He always seemed so mild-mannered.
[Message 32] Liam: Why are you asking so many questions? Are you a cop now?
[Message 33] Chloe: Just trying to understand what happened. You’re acting weird, Liam.
[Message 34] Liam: I'm just stressed. Lay off.
[Message 35] Sarah: Carl had a motive, everyone knew Evelyn was about to expose him for stealing office supplies. If he hadn't stolen, none of this would have happened,
[Message 36] Dana: I heard Carl was looking up how to make Hitting with a golf club online yesterday too! That’s so creepy.
[Message 37] Chloe: Seriously? That’s insane. He could be going away for a long time for this
[Message 38] Liam: Look, I gotta go. I saw him leave the building at Late Morning. That is all I know.
[Message 39] Chloe: Ok. Be careful.
[Message 40] Sarah: What do you think, Chloe? Could it be Carl?
[Message 41] Chloe: It sounds suspicious. But maybe too obvious?
[Message 42] Dana: True. Maybe someone else intended to do it?
[Message 43] Sarah: Like who?
[Message 44] Dana: I don't know! It's all crazy. I'm going home, I can't take it anymore.
[Message 45] Sarah: Okay, get some rest. We'll talk tomorrow.
[Message 46] Chloe: I heard Ms. Evelyn Reed was about to release a report on potential corruption. Anyone know anything about that?
[Message 47] Liam: Corruption? Nope. Never heard anything. You and your crazy theories.
[Message 48] Chloe: Just wondering.
[Message 49] Sarah: Corruption, huh? That explains why she was so hated.
[Message 50] Dana: Evelyn always hated 1.  Law Enforcement Officer. Maybe someone got sick of her.
[Message 51] Chloe: Maybe. It's all so messed up.
[Message 52] Liam: I'm off the grid for a bit. Need to clear my head.
[Message 53] Chloe: Okay. Be safe.
[Message 54] Sarah: Do you think Liam knows something he's not telling us?
[Message 55] Chloe: He's acting weird. I'm not sure what to think.
[Message 56] Dana: Who cares! Evelyn is gone. It's so bad.
[Message 57] Sarah: I know, it's awful.
[Message 58] Chloe: Guys, I just found out Evelyn was about to expose some secret about Liam that would ruin his career.
[Message 59] Sarah: No way! That's a huge motive.
[Message 60] Dana: Wow. This is getting intense. I'm staying out of it.

[Message 41] Sarah: ""I know. I keep thinking about if I knew them better, could I have prevented it?""
[Message 42] Mark: ""Don't beat yourself up about it. There's no way you could have known.""
[Message 43] Sarah: ""Easier said than done. Hey, did you hear about the fire at the old warehouse last month?""
[Message 44] Mark: ""Yeah, what about it?""
[Message 45] Sarah: ""Some people are saying Kevin was seen near the warehouse before it went up in flames.""
[Message 46] Mark: ""Okay, now that's suspicious. Maybe it's his thing... starting fires. A mental illness induced delusion could lead to something like this.""
[Message 47] Sarah: ""That's what I'm saying! It all adds up, doesn't it?""
[Message 48] Mark: ""It does. But we shouldn't jump to conclusions.""
[Message 49] Sarah: ""True. But still... I'm leaning towards Kevin or Benny being involved.""
[Message 50] Mark: ""Me too. Alex seems less likely, but you never know.""
[Message 51] Sarah: ""Exactly. By the way, did you watch that new show everyone's talking about?""
[Message 52] Mark: ""No, I haven't. Is it any good?""
[Message 53] Sarah: ""It's amazing! You should definitely check it out. We can watch it sometime.""
[Message 54] Mark: ""Sounds good. Maybe next week?""
[Message 55] Sarah: ""Perfect. Back to the case though, it sounds as if someone was buying Arson by setting a fire at the store close by.""
[Message 56] Mark: ""That does not sound good at all.""
[Message 57] Sarah: ""It really doesn't.""
[Message 58] Mark: ""Do you think this was the first time something like this has happened?""
[Message 59] Sarah: ""Definitely not. They were definitely aware that this was going to happen.""
[Message 60] Mark: ""That just sounds like this was intended all along.""
[Message 61] Sarah: ""It was.""
[Message 62] Mark: ""This all falls on who started it.""
[Message 63] Sarah: ""Yeah. Their shouting probably provoked him.""
[Message 64] Mark: ""Maybe so, but who knows what he knew.""
[Message 65] Sarah: ""This might be more than he thought.""
[Message 66] Mark: ""Maybe so. Hey did you do that assignment for work?""
[Message 67] Sarah: ""Yeah, I'm waiting to hear back about that, you know?""
[Message 68] Mark: ""Did you ever end up getting tickets for the concert?""
[Message 69] Sarah: ""No, I didn't. I wanted to, but they sold out.""

[Message 75] Sarah: ""I know. We should go more often.""

[Message 36] Kai: ""Just curious. Maybe it was something political. David was always talking about change.""

[Message 6] Noah: Sarah? Wasn't she that Corrections Officer? Seemed so carefree.
[Message 7] Liam: Yeah, that's what I heard. So crazy. What even happened?
[Message 8] Maya: They're saying Poisoning via inhalation. In a parking garage. Makes no sense.
[Message 9] Noah: Poisoning via inhalation? That's awful. Someone must have really hated them.
[Message 10] Liam: Police are looking for suspects, apparently. Said it wasn't random.
[Message 11] Maya: Well, duh. Who just randomly Poisoning via inhalations two people?
[Message 12] Noah: This whole thing is just... depressing. I can't even imagine.
[Message 13] Liam: Seriously. Makes you wonder about people.
[Message 14] Maya: I need a distraction. Anyone wanna grab dinner later?
[Message 15] Noah: I'm in. Anywhere but downtown, though.

[Message 22] Asher: Hey guys, you seen Marco around? Need to ask him something.
[Message 23] Liam: Haven't seen him today, Asher. Why?
[Message 24] Asher: Just a work thing. Nothing important.
[Message 25] Maya: Asher, you seem on edge. Everything okay?
[Message 26] Asher: Yeah, fine. Just stressed about this project deadline.
[Message 27] Noah: Deadlines, huh? I know that feeling.
[Message 28] Asher: Anyway, gotta run. Let me know if you see Marco.
[Message 29] Liam: Will do.

[Message 31] Noah: See ya.
[Message 32] Marco: Hey, what's up? Just saw I missed a call from Asher.
[Message 33] Maya: He was looking for you. Seemed kind of stressed.
[Message 34] Marco: Stressed? About what?
[Message 35] Maya: He didn't say. Just said it was a work thing.
[Message 36] Liam: Maybe it's about the layoffs they're planning?
[Message 37] Marco: Layoffs? Seriously? I hadn't heard anything.
[Message 38] Noah: That's just a rumor, Liam. Don't scare him.
[Message 39] Maya: Yeah, Liam, chill. Don't spread gossip.
[Message 40] Liam: Sorry, sorry. Just saying what I heard.
[Message 41] Marco: Well, great. Now I'm stressed too.
[Message 42] Marco: Hey, did you guys hear about what happened to Alex and Sarah?
[Message 43] Liam: Dude, that's all we've been talking about.
[Message 44] Marco: Crazy, right? I saw Sarah just the other day.
[Message 45] Noah: I saw him leave the building at Afternoon.
[Message 46] Marco: I can't believe it, I heard she was buying Poisoning via inhalation at the store.
[Message 47] Maya: Yeah, that whole thing is so sad and I feel bad for them.
[Message 48] Liam: I think Asher may know more.

[Message 63] Marco: Fine, but this better be good.
[Message 64] Marco: Okay, I'm here. What's this about?
[Message 65] Asher: Look, the cops are asking questions. They know I saw you near the garage at Afternoon.
[Message 66] Marco: So what? I was just passing by.
[Message 67] Asher: They also know you hated Sarah, and that he was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 68] Marco: Where did they get that idea from? I don't know what you're talking about.
[Message 69] Asher: Don't play dumb with me, Marco. I know you and Sarah were fighting recently.
[Message 70] Marco: That's none of your business.
[Message 71] Asher: It is now. If they think we were in this together, we're both going down.
[Message 72] Marco: Together? You're crazy!
[Message 73] Asher: Then tell me what you were doing there!
[Message 74] Marco: I already told you, I was just passing by.
[Message 75] Asher: Don't lie to me.
[Message 76] Marco: Look, I had a reason to be there, okay? But it has nothing to do with what happened to Alex and Sarah.
[Message 77] Asher: What reason?
[Message 78] Marco: I can't tell you. You won't understand.
[Message 79] Asher: I'm starting to think you're the one who did it.
[Message 80] Marco: What?! No way!
[Message 81] Asher: Then tell me the truth!
[Message 82] Marco: I'm not saying anything else without a lawyer.
[Message 83] Asher: Fine. But don't come crying to me when they arrest you.
[Message 84] Marco: You think I'm going to get the death penalty?
[Message 85] Asher: Depends on what they find. And what you tell them.
[Message 86] Marco: I didn't do anything!
[Message 87] Asher: We'll see about that.
[Message 88] Maya: Liam, you were right. Asher IS acting weird.
[Message 89] Liam: Told you! What did he say?
[Message 90] Maya: He just called me, asking if I'd seen Marco. Sounded almost desperate.
[Message 91] Noah: Maybe they're both involved somehow?
[Message 92] Liam: That's what I'm thinking.
[Message 93] Maya: Should we go to the police?
[Message 94] Noah: Let's not jump to conclusions. We don't have any proof.
[Message 95] Liam: But what if they're planning something else?
[Message 96] Maya: Okay, okay. Let's just keep an eye on them for now.
[Message 97] Noah: Agreed. We'll observe and see what happens.
[Message 98] Liam: Good plan. Text me if either of them does anything suspicious.
[Message 99] Maya: Will do. This is so messed up.
[Message 100] Noah: Tell me about it.
[Message 101] Liam: Hey guys, I saw Asher getting into a car with someone I didn’t recognize.
[Message 102] Maya: Where? When?
[Message 103] Liam: Just now, outside his office. They drove off really fast.
[Message 104] Noah: Did you get a license plate?
[Message 105] Liam: No, it was too dark. But it was a black SUV.
[Message 106] Maya: Black SUV... That could be anyone.
[Message 107] Liam: I know, but still. It seemed suspicious.
[Message 108] Noah: Maybe he's just leaving town.
[Message 109] Maya: Or trying to.
[Message 110] Liam: I think he intended to leave.
[Message 111] Liam: Guys, I just saw Marco at the gas station.
[Message 112] Maya: Did he see you?
[Message 113] Liam: No, I ducked down. He was filling up a gas can.
[Message 114] Noah: A gas can? What for?
[Message 115] Liam: I don't know, but it seemed weird. He looked really nervous.
[Message 116] Maya: Maybe he's just going camping.
[Message 117] Liam: In a gas can?
[Message 118] Noah: Okay, that IS weird.
[Message 119] Maya: Let's call the police. This is getting too risky.
[Message 120] Liam: Agreed. I'm calling them now.
[Message 121] Noah: Good call. Be safe.
[Message 122] Maya: Be careful, Liam.
[Message 123] Liam: Theyre on their way.
[Message 124] Noah: Okay, now what?
[Message 125] Liam: We wait. And hope they catch them before they do something else.
[Message 126] Maya: I can't believe this is happening.
[Message 127] Noah: Me neither. It's like something out of a movie.
[Message 128] Liam: More like a nightmare.
[Message 129] Maya: I hope they catch the people who did this. Alex and Sarah deserved better.
[Message 130] Noah: Amen to that.
[Message 131] Marco: Asher, you set me up, didn’t you?
[Message 132] Asher: What are you talking about?
[Message 133] Marco: The police just showed up at my door! They knew everything!
[Message 134] Asher: I didn't tell them anything!
[Message 135] Marco: Then how did they know I was at the parking garage?!
[Message 136] Asher: I don't know! Maybe they were watching you!
[Message 137] Marco: Bullshit! You wanted me to take the fall, didn’t you?
[Message 138] Asher: Don't be ridiculous.
[Message 139] Marco: You're going down for this, Asher! I swear, you're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 140] Asher: I'm innocent!
[Message 141] Marco: We'll see what the police thinks.
[Message 142] Liam: Hey, police found Poisoning via inhalation in Asher's car.
[Message 143] Maya: Wow, so Asher was the one who did it.
[Message 144] Noah: So that confirms my suspicions!
[Message 145] Liam: Hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 32] Jamie: ""Me too. This town's getting scary.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Hey, did you guys see that article about the coffee shop? They mentioned the garrote. That's messed up.""
[Message 34] Kai: ""Yeah, I saw. How did they know it was that?""
[Message 35] Jamie: ""Police must have leaked it. Bad form.""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Totally. Makes you wonder what else they're not telling us.""
[Message 37] Kai: ""True. Speaking of not telling, anyone hear from Owen? He's usually all over social media.""
[Message 38] Jamie: ""Haven't seen anything. Maybe he's grieving.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Or maybe he's laying low. Just saying.""
[Message 40] Kai: ""Laying low why?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""I don't know! Just a thought. He always hated 1.  Law Enforcement Officer, from what I've heard.""
[Message 42] Jamie: ""That's a strong statement, Alex.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Well, I heard them arguing once about some regulations. It got heated.""
[Message 44] Kai: ""Hmm. Maybe he intended to get rid of her. I mean, if he did, hope they get the death penalty.""
[Message 45] Jamie: ""Let's not jump to conclusions. We don't know anything for sure.""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Okay, okay. Just speculating.""
[Message 47] Kai: ""Anyone want to see that new movie tonight? Distract ourselves from all this.""
[Message 48] Jamie: ""I'm down. What time?""

[Message 51] Alex: ""Later.""
[Message 52] Kai: ""Hey Jamie, one more thing about Melissa...did you ever see her wearing any unusual jewelry?""
[Message 53] Jamie: ""Not really. Just the usual stuff. Why?""
[Message 54] Kai: ""No reason. Just a random thought.""
[Message 55] Jamie: ""Okay... well, gotta get going. See you tonight?""
[Message 56] Kai: ""Yep. Later.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Hey, sorry for disappearing. Work emergency.""
[Message 58] Kai: ""No worries. Jamie and I are heading to the movies. Anything new on your end?""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Just catching up on the news. They're saying the killer knew Melissa personally.""
[Message 60] Jamie: ""That's what they always say.""
[Message 61] Alex: ""True. Still unsettling. Hey, Kai, did you say you saw Owen leaving the Coffee Shop? Did he have anything in his hands?""
[Message 62] Kai: ""I didn't really notice. It was dark. Why?""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Just wondering. Seemed like he was looking up how to make Using a garrote online the other day, then all this happened.""
[Message 64] Jamie: ""You're really fixated on Owen, Alex.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""I just want justice for Melissa. She didn't deserve this. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.""
[Message 66] Kai: ""She was buying Using a garrote at the store. Maybe she did it herself.""
[Message 67] Jamie: ""Do you really think so? This is getting out of hand.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""I'm not saying she did, just trying to consider all angles. If the manager wasn't so quick to fire people, we wouldn't be having this conversation.""
[Message 69] Jamie: ""Hope she rest in peace. She made it really big as a cop.""
[Message 70] Kai: ""Yeah, it's a horrible thing. Goodnight guys, I'm out.""

...","[Message 1] Alex: Hey, did you hear about what happened at the gym?
[Message 2] Ben: Yeah, insane. Someone got killed.
[Message 3] Alex: I know, right? Predawn, no less. Scary.
[Message 4] Ben: Yeah, they're saying it was Selena.
[Message 5] Alex: Selena? No way. She wouldn't.
[Message 6] Ben: That’s what I thought too. But the cops were questioning her a while.
[Message 7] Alex: About what?
[Message 8] Ben: I don't know exactly. But people are talking.
[Message 9] Alex: I saw Kai there yesterday. Maybe they saw something?
[Message 10] Ben: Kai? What were they doing there so early?
[Message 11] Alex: Kai always works out at that time.
[Message 12] Ben: True. Heard anything from Jordan?
[Message 13] Alex: Nope. You?
[Message 14] Ben: Nothing. Kind of weird.
[Message 15] Alex: Maybe they’re just freaked out. Everyone is.
[Message 16] Ben: I guess so. Should we try to contact them?
[Message 17] Alex: Maybe later. Let’s give them some space.
[Message 18] Ben: Okay. What about getting lunch?
[Message 19] Alex: Sure, where at?
[Message 20] Ben: How about that new place downtown?
[Message 21] Alex: Sounds good. An hour?
[Message 22] Ben: Perfect. See you then.
[Message 23] Alex: Later.
[Message 24] Ben: BTW I saw Jordan buying an ice pick the other day. Odd, right?
[Message 25] Alex: Seriously? That is kinda weird. Where?
[Message 26] Ben: That hardware store on 6th. I thought nothing of it, but now…
[Message 27] Alex: Okay, now I'm concerned. Selena would never hurt somebody. But the ice pick is too crazy.
[Message 28] Ben: My thoughts exactly. Let’s not jump to conclusions though.
[Message 29] Alex: Right, right.
[Message 30] Kai: Hey guys, what's going on? You all good?
[Message 31] Ben: Just talking about the gym murder. Crazy, right?
[Message 32] Kai: Yeah, super messed up. I saw the whole thing. I saw Jordan leave the building at Predawn.
[Message 33] Alex: What?! You actually saw them? Was it after the incident?
[Message 34] Kai: Yeah, it was right after. They looked shaken.
[Message 35] Ben: Did you call the cops? This changes everything.
[Message 36] Kai: I freaked out, man. I didn’t know what to do. Just saw them running.
[Message 37] Alex: You should’ve called. That might’ve helped her survive.
[Message 38] Ben: Agreed. Kai, you gotta tell the cops.
[Message 39] Kai: I know, I know. I'm going to. I swear.
[Message 40] Alex: Good. Because this is serious. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 41] Ben: Agreed. We will go with you.
[Message 42] Kai: Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
[Message 43] Jordan: What's up? Why are you guys blowing up my phone?
[Message 44] Ben: We need to talk. Face to face.
[Message 45] Jordan: About what?
[Message 46] Alex: Don't play dumb, Jordan. About Selena.
[Message 47] Jordan: Look, I had nothing to do with that.
[Message 48] Ben: Kai saw you leaving the gym right after it happened.
[Message 49] Jordan: Kai is lying. I was home all night.
[Message 50] Alex: And Ben saw you buying an ice pick.
[Message 51] Jordan: It’s for my art project! Geez!
[Message 52] Ben: An ""art project"" that requires a Stabbing with an ice pick?
[Message 53] Jordan: Yes! Look, I'm not going to explain myself to you guys.
[Message 54] Alex: We’re just trying to understand, Jordan. 
[Message 55] Jordan: Understand what? That I’m being accused of something I didn’t do?
[Message 56] Ben: We just want the truth.
[Message 57] Jordan: I told you the truth!
[Message 58] Kai: Guys, can we all just calm down?
[Message 59] Alex: Easier said than done, Kai.
[Message 60] Ben: Yeah, someone’s dead.
[Message 61] Jordan: I know someone’s dead! And I feel terrible about it.
[Message 62] Alex: Did you know Selena well?
[Message 63] Jordan: Not really. We talked a few times at the gym.
[Message 64] Ben: What did you talk about?
[Message 65] Jordan: Just… gym stuff. Workouts, whatever.
[Message 66] Alex: Sounds like BS, Jordan.
[Message 67] Jordan: Look, believe what you want. I gotta go.
[Message 68] Ben: Don’t leave. We’re not done talking.
[Message 69] Jordan: Yes, we are. Bye.
[Message 70] Alex: Dammit.
[Message 71] Ben: They’re definitely hiding something.
[Message 72] Kai: Maybe we should call the cops.
[Message 73] Alex: Agreed. This is beyond us.
[Message 74] Ben: Let’s all go together.
[Message 75] Kai: Okay, meet at the police station in an hour?
[Message 76] Alex: Sounds good.
[Message 77] Ben: See you there.
[Message 78] Jordan: Fine. I'll talk to the cops too. But I swear, I didn't kill Selena.
[Message 79] Alex: Then why were you at the gym that early?
[Message 80] Jordan: I couldn't sleep. I went for a walk. Is that a crime?
[Message 81] Ben: A walk that leads you to the scene of a murder?
[Message 82] Jordan: It’s a coincidence!
[Message 83] Kai: You looked pretty panicked when you were leaving.
[Message 84] Jordan: Of course I was panicked! There were cops everywhere!
[Message 85] Alex: Did you see anyone else there?
[Message 86] Jordan: No! I just wanted to get away from the chaos.
[Message 87] Ben: What about around the activist?
[Message 88] Jordan: What is this, a freaking interrogation? I'm done talking to you guys until I talk to a lawyer.
[Message 89] Alex: Smart move.
[Message 90] Ben: See you at the station, then.
[Message 91] Kai: I still think we should have called when I first saw her leaving the scene.
[Message 92] Alex: I know, Kai. Don't beat yourself up.
[Message 93] Ben: What's done is done. Let's focus on getting justice for Selena.
[Message 94] Alex: Agreed.
[Message 95] Ben: I just can't believe this happened.
[Message 96] Alex: Me neither. Such a waste.
[Message 97] Kai: I was talking to Layla too, and she said that Layla hated Selena.
[Message 98] Alex: Layla? Why?
[Message 99] Kai: Because Selena was getting all the attention in the activist circles.
[Message 100] Ben: Jealousy? Seriously?
[Message 101] Alex: It's possible. People do crazy things.
[Message 102] Ben: I guess so. But an activist organization?
[Message 103] Kai: Yeah, but Layla is pretty intense. She’s always been a bit…off.
[Message 104] Alex: Off how?
[Message 105] Kai: Just… unpredictable. Has strong opinions, you know?
[Message 106] Ben: Alright, now we have two suspects.
[Message 107] Alex: More like two people we need to talk to the cops about.
[Message 108] Ben: Exactly.
[Message 109] Kai: Let's just focus on Selena. The police will figure it out.
[Message 110] Alex: True. But every piece of information helps.
[Message 111] Ben: Agreed.
[Message 112] Jordan: I just spoke to my lawyer. He said I don't have to talk to you guys anymore.
[Message 113] Alex: Good for you, Jordan.
[Message 114] Ben: It won’t save you if you’re guilty.
[Message 115] Jordan: I'm not guilty!
[Message 116] Kai: Guys, can we please stop arguing?
[Message 117] Alex: Fine. But I don't trust Jordan.
[Message 118] Ben: Me neither. But let's let the police do their job.
[Message 119] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 120] Alex: So, police station in half an hour?
[Message 121] Ben: Yep.
[Message 122] Kai: See you there.
[Message 123] Ben: I just remembered, Selena was about to expose Layla.
[Message 124] Alex: Expose her for what?
[Message 125] Ben: I don't know exactly, but it was something big. Selena intended to release it this week.
[Message 126] Alex: That's motive right there.
[Message 127] Kai: Well, that changes everything.
[Message 128] Alex: Let's tell the cops about this immediately.
[Message 129] Ben: Agreed. I think we are getting somewhere now.
[Message 130] Kai: Yes. Let's just hope they catch the person who did this.

6. Ensure all victims are mentioned by name or role (e.g., ""the manager"") at least once in the conversation.
7. **Incorporate at least 3 instances where the messages touch upon key elements of the crime, such as:**
        *   **Actus Reus:** Mentions of actions taken by suspects around the time of the crime (e.g., ""I saw him leave the building at Late Afternoon"", ""She was buying Car accident (vehicular homicide) at the store"").
        *   **Mens Rea:** Hints at the suspects' state of mind, intent, or knowledge (e.g., ""He always hated 3.  Taxi Driver"", ""She said she wanted to get rid of him""). Use words like ""intended,"" ""knew,"" ""aware,"" ""purposefully"".

[Message 1] Liam: ""Did you guys hear about what happened at the Rest Area?""
[Message 2] Chloe: ""Yeah, awful. That poor taxi driver, Alex. So sad.""
[Message 3] Kai: ""Rest Area? What happened? I've been off grid all day.""
[Message 4] Liam: ""Apparently, a hit and run. Alex died. Really messed up.""
[Message 5] Chloe: ""So terrible! I drove past there this Late Afternoon, but didn't see anything unusual.""
[Message 6] Kai: ""Wow. That's heavy. Do they know who did it?""
[Message 7] Liam: ""No clue yet. Cops are investigating. Someone should pay for this. Maybe they'll go away for a long time for this.""
[Message 8] Chloe: ""I hope they catch the person. Alex was always so carefree. Remember that time when Alex saved a cat from a tree.""
[Message 9] Kai: ""Yeah, catch is only part of it. Justice should be served swiftly and surely.""
[Message 10] Liam: ""Right! I saw River near there. River always hated Alex. Thought Alex was undercutting River.""
[Message 11] Chloe: ""River? Seriously? River wouldn't do something like that, would she?""
[Message 12] Kai: ""I don’t know River that well, but Liam does have a point. What was River doing there?""
[Message 13] Liam: ""I don't know for sure. I just saw a large hands figured leave there at Late Afternoon. It's a rough coincidence.""
[Message 14] Chloe: ""That's quite a coincidence! I was buying Car accident (vehicular homicide) at the store, for my niece's birthday. I was thinking about buying Alex a new toy. :( ""
[Message 15] Kai: ""Whoa, hold on. Let's not jump to conclusions about River. She can be a bit abrasive, but River is harmless.""
[Message 16] Liam: ""I’m just saying what I saw. Plus, River was furious when Alex got that big contract, she wanted to get rid of Alex.""
[Message 17] Chloe: ""I still can't believe it. Alex didn't deserve this. Remember when Alex helped us move? Such a kind soul.""
[Message 18] Kai: ""Chloe is right. Alex was a good person. I hope the police find something soon.""
[Message 19] Liam: ""Speaking of police, I gotta head out. Meeting. Will check in later.""
[Message 20] Chloe: ""Okay, Liam. Be safe.""
[Message 21] Kai: ""Later, Liam.""
[Message 22] Chloe: ""This whole thing is just so unsettling. How are you holding up, Kai?""
[Message 23] Kai: ""As well as can be expected, I guess. Just feels surreal.""
[Message 24] Chloe: ""I know, right? I'm thinking of dropping off some flowers at the Rest Area.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""That's a nice idea, Chloe. I might join you later.""
[Message 26] Chloe: ""Okay. I'll let you know when I'm heading over.""
[Message 27] Kai: ""Sounds good. Talk soon.""
[Message 28] Chloe: ""Bye.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Back. Meeting was a waste of time. Any updates?""
[Message 30] Kai: ""Nothing new. Chloe's going to leave flowers for Alex. Did you talk to the police about seeing River?""
[Message 31] Liam: ""Not yet. Debating it. Don't wanna make things worse if it's nothing. But River was talking about hurting Alex right before she went over there, I overheard her. Should I call 911?""
[Message 32] Chloe: ""Liam, you have to! If you saw something, tell them everything! What if River knew, purposefully did this?""
[Message 33] Kai: ""Yeah, Liam. You should definitely tell them. It's the right thing to do.""
[Message 34] Liam: ""Alright, alright. I will. Just feels weird, you know?""
[Message 35] Chloe: ""Weird is better than regret.""
[Message 36] Kai: ""Exactly. Do it. Let them sort it out.""
[Message 37] Liam: ""Fine. Calling now...""
[Message 38] Chloe: ""Okay, let us know what they say!""
[Message 39] Kai: ""Yeah, keep us updated.""
[Message 40] Liam: ""They're sending someone to talk to me. Said it's standard procedure. Seems like they're going to ask all sorts of question.""
[Message 41] Chloe: ""Good. That's what they should do. Did you mention about the big hands?""
[Message 42] Kai: ""I'm glad you called, Liam. I would hate for that to weigh on your mind.""
[Message 43] Liam: ""Yeah, I did. Mentioned everything I saw.""
[Message 44] Chloe: ""Excellent. Every detail helps.""
[Message 45] Kai: ""So, what happens now?""
[Message 46] Liam: ""Waiting for them to arrive. Gonna be a long night, I guess.""
[Message 47] Chloe: ""Well, we're here if you need anything. Don't hesitate to reach out.""
[Message 48] Kai: ""For sure. Anything at all.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""Appreciate that, guys. Really do.""
[Message 50] Chloe: ""No problem, Liam. That's what friends are for. I need to take a nap, this has been a hard day.""
[Message 51] Kai: ""Get some rest, Chloe. Talk to you later.""
[Message 52] Liam: ""Yeah, rest up. I will talk to you later.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""I hope they don't get the death penalty, that would be too bad.""
[Message 54] Kai: ""They probably won't. It was most likely an accident.""
[Message 55] Liam: ""I am tired, I will talk to you later.""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Bye!""
[Message 57] Kai: ""See you later.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Hey, guys, one more thing. Turns out River had an alibi. False alarm.""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""Oh. Well, that is good for River!""
[Message 60] Kai: ""That's great. I guess the police know what they are doing.""
