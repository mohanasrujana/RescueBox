[Message 2] Liam: ""Yeah, crazy. Heard it was someone named 5.  Corrections Officer. Awful.""
[Message 3] Marcus: ""Terrible news. My heart goes out to their family.""
[Message 4] Chloe: ""I know! I was just there yesterday looking at paintings.""
[Message 5] Liam: ""We were all there, last week. What a waste.""
[Message 6] Marcus: ""Speaking of art, Chloe, did you finish that commission for Mrs. Davison?""
[Message 7] Chloe: ""Almost! Just need to put the final touches on it. You going to the farmer's market this weekend?""
[Message 8] Liam: ""Probably not. Got some stuff to catch up on around the house.""
[Message 9] Marcus: ""Same here. Maybe next week.""
[Message 10] Chloe: ""Did anyone know 5.  Corrections Officer well?""
[Message 11] Liam: ""Not really. Just saw them around. They were quiet.""
[Message 12] Marcus: ""I knew them a bit better, through the art circle. Always seemed creative. Sad.""
[Message 13] Chloe: ""So sad. The police are investigating everyone who was at the gallery recently, right?""
[Message 14] Liam: ""Yeah, they interviewed me yesterday. Just routine, I guess.""
[Message 15] Marcus: ""Me too. Asked about my whereabouts Late Evening.""
[Message 16] Chloe: ""Late Evening? That's when it happened?""
[Message 17] Liam: ""Apparently.""
[Message 18] Marcus: ""I was home, watching TV. Alone.""
[Message 19] Chloe: ""I was at Sarah's birthday dinner. Lots of witnesses.""
[Message 20] Liam: ""Lucky you.""
[Message 21] Chloe: ""Guys, this is freaking me out. What if they never find who did it?""
[Message 22] Marcus: ""They will. The police here are pretty good.""
[Message 23] Liam: ""Hope so. Justice for 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 24] Chloe: ""Amen to that. What did the police ask you, Liam?""
[Message 25] Liam: ""Just the usual. Where I was, if I knew 5.  Corrections Officer, etc. Nothing exciting.""
[Message 26] Marcus: ""Same here. They seemed interested in my connection to 5.  Corrections Officer’s work.""
[Message 27] Chloe: ""Why?""
[Message 28] Marcus: ""Apparently, 5.  Corrections Officer thought I was stealing ideas from their art.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Seriously? Drama.""
[Message 30] Chloe: ""Wow, I didn't know that.""
[Message 31] Marcus: ""It was nothing. Just some artistic differences. Definitely didn't intend any harm to 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 32] Liam: ""Still, I'd be careful. The police might see that as a motive.""
[Message 33] Marcus: ""I know, I know. It's just... frustrating. This whole thing is.""
[Message 34] Chloe: ""Frustrating is an understatement. Scary is more like it. Has anyone talked to Kai?""
[Message 35] Liam: ""Kai? Why would we talk to Kai?""
[Message 36] Chloe: ""I saw Kai at the art gallery Late Evening, talking to 5.  Corrections Officer. He looked angry.""
[Message 37] Marcus: ""Oh really? I didn't see that.""
[Message 38] Liam: ""Me neither. Kai always has a temper, though.""
[Message 39] Chloe: ""Maybe the police should talk to him.""
[Message 40] Marcus: ""Yeah, maybe. Anyway, I gotta run. Painting deadline looming. Talk later.""
[Message 41] Liam: ""Later, Marcus.""
[Message 42] Chloe: ""Bye, Marcus.""
[Message 43] Chloe: ""Liam, are you sure you didn't see Kai?""
[Message 44] Liam: ""Positive. I left the gallery way before Late Evening. Had dinner with my mom.""
[Message 45] Chloe: ""Okay. Just seems weird he wasn't mentioned yet.""
[Message 46] Liam: ""He's probably just laying low. Doesn't want to get involved.""
[Message 47] Chloe: ""Maybe. I’m going to sleep now. Goodnight.""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Night.""
[Message 49] Marcus: ""Hey, guys, sorry I disappeared. Something came up.""
[Message 50] Chloe: ""No worries. Anything serious?""
[Message 51] Marcus: ""Nah, just a family thing. Back to painting now. This deadline is killing me.""
[Message 52] Liam: ""Good luck with that. Still thinking about 5.  Corrections Officer. They were so young.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""I know, it's just... senseless.""
[Message 54] Marcus: ""Absolutely. A real tragedy.""
[Message 55] Liam: ""Hey, Chloe, did you ever find that Strangulation with a rope you were looking for for your macrame project?""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Yeah, I did, thanks! Found a great one at the craft store. Why?""
[Message 57] Liam: ""No reason. Just remembered you mentioning it.""
[Message 58] Chloe: ""Odd thing to remember during this chaos.""
[Message 59] Marcus: ""He’s probably just trying to keep things light.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Exactly. I was trying to lighten the mood. Seriously, though, what if the police suspect one of us?""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""Don't even say that! We're all friends here.""
[Message 62] Marcus: ""Yeah, Liam, that's not cool. We’re all in shock.""
[Message 63] Liam: ""Sorry, sorry. Just paranoid, I guess.""
[Message 64] Chloe: ""I get it. Me too.""
[Message 65] Marcus: ""Anyone hear anything new from the police?""
[Message 66] Liam: ""Nothing. Still quiet on my end.""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""Same here. I did see Kai downtown today. He looked really nervous.""
[Message 68] Marcus: ""Hmm. Interesting.""
[Message 69] Liam: ""Maybe you should tell the police that, Chloe.""
[Message 70] Chloe: ""I will if they ask. Don't want to jump to conclusions.""
[Message 71] Marcus: ""Good call. Let them do their job.""
[Message 72] Liam: ""True. I wonder if 5.  Corrections Officer had any enemies. Maybe someone from their workplace?""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Possible. Seems like a dangerous job.""
[Message 74] Marcus: ""I don’t know. I heard 5.  Corrections Officer was planning to expose a secret about someone at the gallery.""
[Message 75] Chloe: ""Whoa. That changes things.""
[Message 76] Liam: ""Now THAT'S a motive. Who would they expose?""
[Message 77] Marcus: ""I don't know. But I overheard them talking about it on the phone. Sounded serious.""
[Message 78] Chloe: ""Maybe that's what Kai was angry about Late Evening? He knew?""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Possible. Or maybe Marcus is just trying to shift the blame since he and 5.  Corrections Officer argued about art.""
[Message 80] Marcus: ""Hey! That’s uncalled for. I would never…""
[Message 81] Chloe: ""Okay, guys, let's not turn on each other. This is exactly what the police want.""
[Message 82] Liam: ""You're right. Sorry, Marcus. Just stressed.""
[Message 83] Marcus: ""Apology accepted. I’m stressed too. Just... let's focus on finding out the truth.""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""Agreed. Has anyone checked 5.  Corrections Officer's social media?""
[Message 85] Liam: ""Good idea. I'll take a look.""
[Message 86] Marcus: ""Me too. Maybe they posted something hinting at who they were going to expose.""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""Okay, report back if you find anything.""
[Message 88] Liam: ""Will do. This is all so messed up. Poor 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 89] Marcus: ""Hey, quick question, Liam. You said you had dinner with your mom that night? Did she see you all night?""
[Message 90] Liam: ""Yeah, why?""
[Message 91] Marcus: ""Just curious. My mom always remembers every detail. Thought she could be a witness.""
[Message 92] Liam: ""She wasn't paying that much attention. We just watched TV. What’s with all the questions, Marcus? You acting weird.""
[Message 93] Chloe: ""Yeah Marcus, chill out.""
[Message 94] Marcus: ""Sorry, just trying to help the police. I thought that if you weren't there during the time, then that would clear things up.""
[Message 95] Liam: ""I get it. It's just... this is making me nervous.""
[Message 96] Chloe: ""Me too. Let's just try to stay calm and cooperate with the police.""
[Message 97] Marcus: ""Agreed. Hey, has anyone thought about the fact that whoever did this could get the death penalty? Insane!""
[Message 98] Liam: ""Whoa, slow down, Marcus. Don't jump to conclusions. We don't even know who did it yet.""
[Message 99] Chloe: ""Exactly. One step at a time. I'm going to log off now. Too much.""

[Message 2] Sarah: Not really. Just browsing. You?
[Message 3] Tom: Usual junk. Someone's gotta buy it, right?
[Message 4] Emily: Yeah, that's the flea market spirit.
[Message 5] Marcus: Saw some interesting... tech over by stall 42.
[Message 6] Sarah: Tech? Like what kind?
[Message 7] Tom: Old radios, probably. Or busted TVs.
[Message 8] Marcus: Maybe. Maybe not.
[Message 9] Emily: Depends on what you're looking for.
[Message 10] Sarah: Stall 42, huh? I might check that out.
[Message 11] Marcus: Don't say I didn't warn you.
[Message 12] Tom: What's that supposed to mean?
[Message 13] Marcus: Exactly what I said.
[Message 14] Emily: He's just being cryptic. Ignore him.
[Message 15] Sarah: Cryptic like...?
[Message 16] Marcus: Like, maybe the stuff isn't exactly... above board.
[Message 17] Tom: Now hold on a minute...
[Message 18] Emily: Tom, just... let it go.
[Message 19] Sarah: Above board in what way? Did you see something?
[Message 20] Marcus: I saw enough.
[Message 21] Emily: He probably just means it's overpriced.
[Message 22] Sarah: Maybe. But something feels off.
[Message 23] Tom: You always think something feels off, Sarah.
[Message 24] Marcus: Let her think what she wants.
[Message 25] Emily: So, anything else interesting today, besides Marcus's paranoia?
[Message 26] Tom: Found a cool vintage lighter. Nothing crazy.
[Message 27] Sarah: Lighters are cool. Practical, too.
[Message 28] Marcus: Practical for some things.
[Message 29] Emily: Marcus!
[Message 30] Tom: What's with you today? You on edge?
[Message 31] Marcus: Just... observant.
[Message 32] Sarah: Observant of...?
[Message 33] Marcus: Things. Events. Circumstances.
[Message 34] Emily: Right. Well, I'm going to get some coffee. Anyone want anything?
[Message 35] Tom: Black coffee for me, thanks.
[Message 36] Sarah: I'll come with you. Need to stretch my legs.
[Message 37] Marcus: Sounds good.
[Message 38] Emily: Okay, be back in a bit.
[Message 39] Sarah: Coming, Emily.
[Message 40] Marcus: (To Tom) So, you gonna ask?
[Message 41] Tom: Ask what? Don't play dumb.
[Message 42] Marcus: I'm not playing anything.
[Message 43] Tom: About stall 42. You know.
[Message 44] Marcus: Why would I know anything about stall 42?
[Message 45] Tom: Because you just implied... things.
[Message 46] Marcus: Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I saw things that weren't there.
[Message 47] Tom: Bull. You saw something. What?
[Message 48] Marcus: Just... some guys moving stuff. Quickly.
[Message 49] Tom: Moving what stuff?
[Message 50] Marcus: Doesn't matter. It's done.
[Message 51] Tom: Done how? Done what?
[Message 52] Marcus: Look, I don't want to talk about it, okay?
[Message 53] Tom: Fine. But if something shady went down...

[Message 56] Sarah: (Returning) Smells good.
[Message 57] Tom: Thanks, Emily.

[Message 60] Marcus: Forget about it.

[Message 62] Tom: Yeah, some of us are curious.
[Message 63] Marcus: Curiosity killed the cat.
[Message 64] Emily: Okay, enough with the riddles.
[Message 65] Sarah: Did you say something about moving things fast?
[Message 66] Marcus: It was nothing. Really.
[Message 67] Tom: Yeah, just a couple of guys... unloading... something.

[Message 2] Jamie: Pretty good, Alex! Just got here. My pup, Buster, is already making friends.
[Message 3] River: Wee hours at the park is the best! Less crowded.
[Message 4] Alex: Agreed, River! Jamie, that's awesome. My golden, Leo, is being a goofball as usual.
[Message 5] Jamie: Leo sounds adorable. Buster is part Beagle, so he's mostly nose-to-the-ground.
[Message 6] River: Haha! Typical Beagle. Speaking of, I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Wish me luck!
[Message 7] Alex: Good luck, River! Everything alright?
[Message 8] River: Routine checkup. But you know how it is, always a little nerve-wracking.
[Message 9] Jamie: Understandable. Hope it goes well! Hey, has anyone been following that debate about standardized testing in schools?
[Message 10] Alex: I've seen a few articles pop up. Seems pretty heated. What are your thoughts, Jamie?
[Message 11] Jamie: I'm torn. On one hand, standardized tests seem like a decent way to gauge student performance. But on the other hand, they put so much pressure on kids and teachers.
[Message 12] River: I agree. I think it stifles creativity and focuses too much on rote memorization.
[Message 13] Alex: Definitely. My cousin's a teacher, and she says it's basically teaching to the test now. No room for exploring other subjects.
[Message 14] Jamie: Exactly! It's like, what happened to the joy of learning?
[Message 15] River: Seriously! When I was younger, I loved science experiments. Now it's all about bubbling in the right answer.
[Message 16] Alex: Remember making volcanoes in elementary school? Classic!
[Message 17] Jamie: Oh yeah! Baking soda and vinegar explosion! Good times.
[Message 18] River: So much mess. So much fun.
[Message 19] Alex: Back to education… maybe there's a better way to assess students. Portfolio-based assessments, perhaps?
[Message 20] Jamie: I've heard good things about those. More holistic, right?
[Message 21] River: Definitely shows a broader range of skills and understanding. Photography classes use that method a lot.
[Message 22] Alex: That makes sense, River. Thinking outside the box is key.
[Message 23] Jamie: It just feels like we're failing a lot of kids by focusing solely on standardized tests.
[Message 24] Alex: Agreed. Especially those who learn differently.
[Message 25] River: Absolutely. Everyone learns at their own pace and in their own way.
[Message 26] Jamie: So true. Okay, I'm stepping off my soapbox now! Sorry for the rant!
[Message 27] Alex: No worries, Jamie! It's an important topic.
[Message 28] River: Yeah, we all feel the same way. Just wish there was an easy solution.
[Message 29] Alex: If only! Hey, anyone got any fun plans for the weekend?
[Message 30] Jamie: I'm thinking of catching a baseball game. The weather should be nice.
[Message 31] River: Ooh, that sounds fun! I might try to hit up a new photography exhibit downtown.
[Message 32] Alex: Nice! I'm probably going to try and learn a new song on my guitar.
[Message 33] Jamie: Cool! What kind of music do you play, Alex?
[Message 34] Alex: Mostly acoustic stuff. Folk, some indie rock.
[Message 35] River: Awesome! I love live music. Nashville, after all!
[Message 36] Jamie: Oh, I saw a cool documentary about educational reform in Finland. Worth checking out, if you're still on that topic, haha.
[Message 37] Alex: Finland always gets brought up when talking about education. I'll look it up! Thanks, Jamie.
[Message 38] River: Adding it to my watchlist.
[Message 39] Alex: It's getting late. Leo's starting to get antsy.
[Message 40] Jamie: Buster's getting sleepy too. Probably ready for a belly rub.
[Message 41] River: Time to head home for me as well. Good luck at your appointment tomorrow, River!
[Message 42] Alex: Ditto! Good luck, River.
[Message 43] River: Thanks, guys! Appreciate it.
[Message 44] Jamie: No problem! Good night, everyone!
[Message 45] Alex: Night, Jamie! Night, River!
[Message 46] River: Night, Alex! Night, Jamie!
[Message 47] Jamie: Oh, before I forget, did you all see that crazy sunset earlier? Perfect for a photoshoot, River!
[Message 48] River: I missed it! Darn it.
[Message 49] Alex: It was pretty spectacular. Maybe you can catch one tomorrow night!
[Message 50] Jamie: Yep! They're supposed to be even better.
[Message 51] River: I'll keep an eye out! Thanks for the heads up.

[Message 4] Mark: Church? No, what happened?
[Message 5] Sarah: Horrible. They found Dale and Alex both dead.
[Message 6] Mark: What?! Dale and Alex? What are you talking about?
[Message 7] Sarah: Murdered. I guess it happened last night.
[Message 8] Mark: That's awful. Poor Dale. He always was so creative, even when things were rough.
[Message 9] Sarah: And Alex, too. So stubborn, but always fighting for what he believed in.
[Message 10] Mark: I didn't know them well. I think I saw Dale at the coffee shop once or twice.
[Message 11] Sarah: You must have seen Alex at the rallies. He was always there.
[Message 12] Mark: Right, vaguely. So, what happened exactly?
[Message 13] Sarah: I don't know all the details, but I heard it was violent. The police are investigating.
[Message 14] Mark: They'll probably be going after his partners.
[Message 15] Sarah: His partners? I'm not sure i follow you.
[Message 16] Mark: Nevermind.
[Message 17] Sarah: This is insane. I can't believe this happened in Reading.

[Message 23] Jenny: I saw Brenda at the bakery yesterday. She looked distraught.
[Message 24] Chloe: Brenda? Why? Was she close to them?
[Message 25] Jenny: I don't know, but she kept muttering about ""accidents"" and ""going too far."" Weird.
[Message 26] Chloe: ""Accidents""? That's suspicious.
[Message 27] Jenny: I know, right? I also heard she was buying Strangulation with a rope at the store
[Message 28] Chloe: What! She bought what?
[Message 29] Jenny:Strangulation with a rope. I don't want to spread rumors, but I am a bit nervous because she was also talking about wanting to get rid of someone.
[Message 30] Chloe: OMG Jenny! Did you tell the police?
[Message 31] Jenny: I might if I am not mistaken. I am very afraid right now.
[Message 32] Chloe: Yes, you must.

[Message 36] Frank: Yeah, terrible. What a waste.
[Message 37] David: I saw you near Church last night. Everything okay?
[Message 38] Frank: I was just taking a walk. Needed some air. I have a distinctive gait, you know.
[Message 39] David: At that hour?
[Message 40] Frank: Look, I didn't do anything. Don't try to pin this on me.
[Message 41] David: Nobody's pinning anything. Just asking a question.
[Message 42] Frank: Well, I resent the implication. I wouldn't hurt anyone.
[Message 43] David: Relax, Frank. I just... I'm shaken up about all this.

[Message 44] Chloe: Did you hear Brenda tried to talk him out of it.
[Message 45] Jenny: Frank? He was looking up how to make Strangulation with a rope online
[Message 46] Chloe: What are we going to do? They are going away for a long time for this
[Message 47] Jenny: We have to make a choice here

[Message 50] Brenda: It's about... everything. I'm scared, Susan.
[Message 51] Susan: Scared? About what? The murders?
[Message 52] Brenda: Yes! And... other things. I saw Frank leave the building at Night.
[Message 53] Susan: Frank? From the activist group? What was he doing there?
[Message 54] Brenda: I don't know! I just... I had a bad feeling. He said he wanted to get rid of him.
[Message 55] Susan: You need to go to the police, Brenda. This is serious.
[Message 56] Brenda: I can't! I... I was there too. I was intending to buy Strangulation with a rope at the store and now everyone will suspect I did it.
[Message 57] Susan: What? Brenda, what are you saying?
[Message 58] Brenda: I... it was an accident. I swear. I just wanted to... protect someone.

[Message 66] Sarah: Night.

[Message 67] Brenda: Please, you have to believe me.
[Message 68] Susan: What happened, Brenda? Tell me everything.
[Message 69] Brenda: It was Frank. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there. I tried to stop him. I swear I did. I didn't realize he was so angry.
[Message 70] Susan: And Dale? What about Dale?
[Message 71] Brenda: I don't know! I only saw Frank. I panicked. I should have called 911 after Dale was hurt. Everything would have been different.
[Message 72] Susan: The police need to know this, Brenda.

[Message 73] Frank: David, we need to talk.
[Message 74] David: About what, Frank?
[Message 75] Frank: About keeping our mouths shut. They're going to blame both of us.
[Message 76] David: About Church? What are you talking about?
[Message 77] Frank: Don't play dumb. You know what I'm talking about. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened

[Message 34] Alex: I'd love to see Alaska. Do some hiking.
[Message 35] Jamie: Alaska sounds amazing! I'm thinking maybe a trip to Italy. See some art, eat some pasta.
[Message 36] Riley: Italy! Jealous!
[Message 37] Alex: That sounds incredible, Jamie.
[Message 38] Jamie: It's been on my bucket list for ages.
[Message 39] Riley: Okay, quick question. Favorite pizza topping?
[Message 40] Alex: Pepperoni, classic.
[Message 41] Jamie: Mushrooms!
[Message 42] Riley: Pineapple. Don't judge.
[Message 43] Alex: I won't judge...but I might judge silently.
[Message 44] Jamie: Haha! We all have our pizza preferences.
[Message 45] Riley: True. Speaking of preferences, how's everyone feeling about the new office layout?
[Message 46] Alex: I haven't been in the office in ages! Trucking life, remember?
[Message 47] Jamie: It's… different. I'm still getting used to it.
[Message 48] Riley: Yeah, it's a bit more open. Takes some getting used to.
[Message 49] Alex: Open concept, huh? Sounds trendy.
[Message 50] Jamie: Trendy but a little less private.
[Message 51] Riley: Exactly. Okay, back to Sarah's presentation. What are your expectations, Jamie?
[Message 52] Jamie: I think the client will love the use of natural light. It's a big selling point.
[Message 53] Alex: Natural light is always a winner.
[Message 54] Riley: Agreed. And her renderings are always so impressive.
[Message 55] Jamie: Absolutely. She's got a real gift.
[Message 56] Alex: So, gaming tournament, Riley, when are you thinking of holding it?
[Message 57] Riley: Probably next month. Need to find a venue and spread the word.
[Message 58] Jamie: I can help with spreading the word! I know some people in the community.
[Message 59] Alex: I can put up some flyers at the truck stops.
[Message 60] Riley: You guys are the best! Seriously.
[Message 61] Jamie: No problem! Happy to help.
[Message 62] Alex: So, about this choir, Jamie...what kind of music do you sing?
[Message 63] Jamie: All sorts! Mostly classical and some more modern stuff.
[Message 64] Riley: Sounds intense.
[Message 65] Alex: I bet it's beautiful.
[Message 66] Jamie: It is! Very therapeutic.
[Message 67] Riley: I should find a hobby like that. Something relaxing.
[Message 68] Alex: Gaming can be relaxing! Until you rage quit.
[Message 69] Jamie: Haha! True.
[Message 70] Riley: Okay, I need recommendations. Relaxing hobbies. Go!
[Message 71] Alex: Knitting?
[Message 72] Jamie: Reading?
[Message 73] Riley: Knitting? Seriously?
[Message 74] Alex: Hey, it's calming!
[Message 75] Jamie: And you get a scarf out of it!
[Message 76] Riley: True. I'll consider it.
[Message 77] Alex: So, future plans… anyone thinking about starting a family?
[Message 78] Jamie: Not me! I'm enjoying my freedom too much.
[Message 79] Riley: Same here. Maybe someday, but not anytime soon.
[Message 80] Alex: Just curious!
[Message 81] Jamie: Fair enough!
[Message 82] Riley: Okay, need advice. What's the best way to deal with a difficult client?
[Message 83] Alex: Patience. And a lot of deep breaths.
[Message 84] Jamie: And really listening to their concerns. Even if they're being unreasonable.
[Message 85] Riley: Good point. Active listening.
[Message 86] Alex: Sometimes they just want to be heard.
[Message 87] Jamie: Exactly! Validate their feelings.
[Message 88] Riley: Okay, I'll try that. Thanks, guys!
[Message 89] Alex: No problem!
[Message 90] Jamie: We're here for you!
[Message 91] Riley: Speaking of feelings, anyone else feeling the pressure of the upcoming deadline?
[Message 92] Alex: Not really, deadlines are different in my field. It’s just, get there on time.
[Message 93] Jamie: Oh yeah. The Peterson project deadline is looming.
[Message 94] Riley: Tell me about it.
[Message 95] Alex: You got this!
[Message 96] Jamie: We’ll all get through it together!
[Message 97] Riley: Thanks! Teamwork makes the dream work, right?
[Message 98] Alex: You know it!
[Message 99] Jamie: Absolutely!
[Message 100] Riley: Okay, let’s talk about something fun again. If you could have any superpower, what would it be?
[Message 101] Alex: Teleportation! No more traffic!
[Message 102] Jamie: Healing powers.
[Message 103] Riley: Time travel. Definitely time travel.
[Message 104] Alex: Time travel is tempting…
[Message 105] Jamie: So many possibilities!
[Message 106] Riley: Exactly! I could fix all my past mistakes!
[Message 107] Alex: Or make even bigger ones!
[Message 108] Jamie: Haha! True!
[Message 109] Riley: Worth the risk!
[Message 110] Alex: So, Jamie, any singing gigs coming up?
[Message 111] Jamie: Not yet! But we’re working on a new piece for the spring concert.
[Message 112] Riley: Awesome!
[Message 113] Alex: I'd love to come see it!
[Message 114] Jamie: I’ll let you know when it is!
[Message 115] Riley: Sweet!
[Message 116] Alex: So, back to home improvement, Jamie, any specific projects planned besides the kitchen?
[Message 117] Jamie: I'd love to redo the garden, but that feels like a summer project.
[Message 118] Riley: Gardens are a lot of work!
[Message 119] Alex: They are! But so rewarding.
[Message 120] Jamie: True! I dream of having a beautiful rose garden.
[Message 121] Riley: That sounds lovely.
[Message 122] Alex: Okay, I need to hit the road. But this was fun!
[Message 123] Jamie: Drive safe, Alex!
[Message 124] Riley: Yeah, be careful out there!
[Message 125] Alex: Will do! Talk to you guys later!
[Message 126] Jamie: Bye!
[Message 127] Riley: Later!
[Message 128] Jamie: So, Riley, still brainstorming that gaming tournament?
[Message 129] Riley: Yup! Venue is proving to be tricky.
[Message 130] Jamie: Maybe check out the community center?
[Message 131] Riley: Good idea! I'll look into it.
[Message 132] Jamie: Let me know if you need help contacting them!
[Message 133] Riley: Will do! You're a lifesaver.
[Message 134] Jamie: Just happy to help!
[Message 135] Riley: Okay, I'm going to focus on Sarah's presentation for a bit. Need to be prepared to offer constructive feedback.
[Message 136] Jamie: Absolutely! That's important.
[Message 137] Riley: Yeah, gotta be supportive but also honest.
[Message 138] Jamie: Exactly!
[Message 139] Riley: Well, wish me luck!
[Message 140] Jamie: Good luck! I'm sure you'll do great!
[Message 141] Riley: Thanks!
[Message 142] Jamie: Okay, I'm going to grab some coffee. Want anything?
[Message 143] Riley: I'm good, thanks!
[Message 144] Jamie: Alright! Be back in a bit.
[Message 145] Riley: Sounds good!
[Message 146] Jamie: Maybe I will try that new coffee shop after all...
[Message 147] Riley: Treat yourself! You deserve it.
[Message 148] Jamie: I think I will!
[Message 149] Riley: Have a good one!
[Message 150] Jamie: You too!",0,

[Message 2] Kai: ""Anya, you know I'm a sucker for cat videos. Send it over!""
[Message 3] Rowan: ""I think I saw something similar. Is it the one with the tiny tuxedo cat?""
[Message 4] Liam: ""Probably! Those cat videos are taking over my feed.""
[Message 5] Anya: ""Haha, yeah! It's adorable. Speaking of feeds, anyone else feeling overwhelmed by all the 'clean eating' content lately?""
[Message 6] Kai: ""Ugh, tell me about it. Makes me want to eat a giant burger out of spite.""
[Message 7] Rowan: ""I just ignore it. Everything in moderation, right?""
[Message 8] Liam: ""Agreed, Rowan. I saw one post advocating for only eating air... literally.""
[Message 9] Anya: ""Air? Oh my god, people are crazy. How was everyone's family dinner this week?""
[Message 10] Kai: ""Mine was… loud. But good. My aunt made her famous lasagna.""
[Message 11] Rowan: ""Lasagna sounds amazing! Mine was pretty standard – roast chicken.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Roast chicken is a classic. We had spaghetti and meatballs. Simple but satisfying.""
[Message 13] Anya: ""We tried a new Indian recipe. It was pretty spicy, but delicious!""
[Message 14] Kai: ""Ooh, what kind of Indian? I love Indian food.""
[Message 15] Anya: ""It was a vindaloo. Super flavorful.""
[Message 16] Rowan: ""Back to social media... what about the sudden obsession with making sourdough bread? Is that still a thing?""
[Message 17] Liam: ""I think it's dying down, Rowan. Now it's all about elaborate cakes.""
[Message 18] Anya: ""Oh god, the cakes. I saw one that looked like a dragon. Insane.""
[Message 19] Kai: ""I tried the sourdough thing. It was a DISASTER. My apartment smelled like yeast for a week.""
[Message 20] Rowan: ""Haha, oh no! I admire your effort, though.""
[Message 21] Liam: ""Yeah, Kai, props for trying! I'm sticking to store-bought bread.""
[Message 22] Anya: ""Same here. I'm good at cooking, but baking intimidates me.""
[Message 23] Kai: ""Honestly, same. Cooking is an art, baking is a science, and I failed science.""
[Message 24] Rowan: ""That's a great way to put it, Kai!""
[Message 25] Liam: ""So, anyone see the latest political drama unfolding on Twitter? I'm trying to avoid it.""
[Message 26] Kai: ""Liam, you and me both. My blood pressure can't handle it.""
[Message 27] Anya: ""I'm steering clear too. Just too much negativity.""
[Message 28] Rowan: ""Agreed. I'm focusing on positive things, like… cute animal videos.""
[Message 29] Anya: ""See? You get it, Rowan!""
[Message 30] Kai: ""Maybe we should all just log off for a week and go camping.""
[Message 31] Liam: ""That actually sounds amazing, Kai.""
[Message 32] Rowan: ""I'm in! Nature is the best cure for social media overload.""
[Message 33] Anya: ""I second that! Camping sounds perfect.""
[Message 34] Kai: ""Okay, okay, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Just a thought for now.""
[Message 35] Liam: ""Haha, true. Still, it's a good thought. What's the next big social media trend, you think?""
[Message 36] Anya: ""My guess? Something totally unexpected and ridiculous.""
[Message 37] Kai: ""Probably. Like people wearing live fish as earrings.""
[Message 38] Rowan: ""Please no. Don't even put that out into the universe, Kai.""
[Message 39] Liam: ""I'm with Rowan on that one. Let's hope not.""
[Message 40] Anya: ""Okay, fish earrings are officially banned from our conversation.""
[Message 41] Kai: ""Fine, fine. But you know it's only a matter of time before something equally bizarre goes viral.""
[Message 42] Rowan: ""True. It's the nature of the beast.""
[Message 43] Liam: ""I saw a guy the other day wearing two different shoes. I feel like that's going to be a thing.""
[Message 44] Anya: ""Mismatched shoes? Interesting...""
[Message 45] Kai: ""I could see that catching on, actually. A little rebellious.""
[Message 46] Rowan: ""Maybe I'll try it tomorrow and see what happens.""
[Message 47] Liam: ""Go for it, Rowan! Be a trendsetter.""
[Message 48] Anya: ""Take a picture and post it! For science.""
[Message 49] Kai: ""Yes! Document your journey.""
[Message 50] Rowan: ""Okay, okay, you guys are putting too much pressure on me.""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Just kidding! But seriously, what do you guys think about that filter that makes you look old?""
[Message 52] Anya: ""Oh god, I hate those filters. They're so unflattering.""
[Message 53] Kai: ""I tried it on my cat. It was terrifying.""
[Message 54] Rowan: ""Haha! I can only imagine.""
[Message 55] Liam: ""My grandma used it and thought it was real. I had to explain it to her for like an hour.""
[Message 56] Anya: ""Oh no! That's hilarious and also a little sad.""
[Message 57] Kai: ""Technology, man. It's a wild ride.""
[Message 58] Rowan: ""Speaking of grandmas, mine still uses a flip phone.""
[Message 59] Liam: ""Respect.""
[Message 60] Anya: ""My grandpa refuses to use email.""
[Message 61] Kai: ""My grandma texts me in all caps. ALWAYS.""
[Message 62] Rowan: ""Haha! Classic grandma move.""
[Message 63] Liam: ""Alright, back to food... what are we all having for dinner tonight?""
[Message 64] Anya: ""I'm making a stir-fry. Quick and easy.""
[Message 65] Kai: ""Probably takeout. I'm feeling lazy.""
[Message 66] Rowan: ""I'm having leftovers from family dinner.""
[Message 67] Liam: ""I think I'll order pizza.""
[Message 68] Anya: ""Pizza sounds good! Now I'm regretting my stir-fry decision.""
[Message 69] Kai: ""It's never too late to order pizza, Anya.""
[Message 70] Rowan: ""Seconded. Pizza is always a good choice.""
[Message 71] Liam: ""Come to the dark side, Anya. We have pizza.""
[Message 72] Anya: ""Okay, you've convinced me. Pizza it is!""
[Message 73] Kai: ""Yes! Victory is mine!""
[Message 74] Rowan: ""Haha! You're easily swayed, Anya.""
[Message 75] Liam: ""So, what kind of pizza are we thinking?""
[Message 76] Anya: ""I'm craving pepperoni.""
[Message 77] Kai: ""I'm always down for a classic pepperoni. Maybe with some mushrooms?""
[Message 78] Rowan: ""I like veggie pizza. Lots of toppings.""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Okay, pepperoni and mushroom it is! And maybe a side veggie pizza for Rowan.""
[Message 80] Anya: ""Perfect! You're the best, Liam.""
[Message 81] Kai: ""Agreed! Pizza night is a success.""
[Message 82] Rowan: ""Thanks, Liam! I appreciate the veggie option.""
[Message 83] Liam: ""No problem! Anything for my friends.""
[Message 84] Anya: ""This has been a very productive conversation.""
[Message 85] Kai: ""Agreed. We've solved all the world's problems. And ordered pizza.""
[Message 86] Rowan: ""Truly a win-win situation.""
[Message 87] Liam: ""Okay, I'm ordering now. Anyone want anything else?""
[Message 88] Anya: ""Just the pizza for me, thanks!""

13,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Hey! Just got to Foot Locker. Ugh, shoe shopping is NOT my favorite. How's your morning going?""
[Message 2] Jamie: ""Hey Alex! Morning is chaos, as usual. Barnaby decided the sourdough starter was a chew toy. A chewy, fermented chew toy.""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Barnaby! Oh no! That's... dedication. How much did he eat?""
[Message 4] Jamie: ""Enough to be gurgling. I'm half expecting him to start proofing himself. How's the hunt for the perfect shoe going?""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Proofing himself! I can't. Honestly, hopeless. I need something for the construction site, durable, but everything is so...beige.""
[Message 6] Jamie: ""Beige is the enemy! Maybe try looking at hiking boots? They tend to be tougher and come in more interesting colours.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Good call! I hadn't thought of hiking boots. I'm gonna wander over to that section. Thanks!""
[Message 8] Jamie: ""No problem! Let me know if you find anything exciting. Seriously, I need a vicarious thrill after the sourdough incident.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Will do! Ooh, these Keens look promising. A little less beige, a little more...khaki. Progress!""
[Message 10] Jamie: ""Khaki is a step up! So, book club meeting next week, right? Ready to discuss?""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Yep, next week. Honestly? Not really. I'm only halfway through 'The Midnight Bloom.' It's a slog.""
[Message 12] Jamie: ""Oh, I know! I finished it, but it was a tough one. Very descriptive, but the plot was a bit meandering.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Meandering is a kind word. I feel like I'm wandering through a very flowery swamp.""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""Haha, that's perfect! Maybe we can just spend the meeting complaining about flowery swamps.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""I'm in! I'll bring snacks. Maybe something swamp-themed. Like green slime pudding.""
[Message 16] Jamie: ""Yes! Swamp snacks! You're the best. Okay, gotta go wrangle Barnaby. He's eyeing the house plants.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Good luck with Barnaby the Botanical Destroyer! I'll send pics of shoe progress.""
[Message 18] Jamie: ""Please do! And may the shoe gods be with you.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Okay, these Merrell Moab 2s are actually kinda nice. They have a steel toe, too. Practical AND slightly less beige.""
[Message 20] Jamie: ""Steel toe AND less beige? We have a winner! Do they feel comfortable?""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Trying them on now... yeah, pretty good. Not as comfy as my slippers, but significantly more appropriate for construction.""
[Message 22] Jamie: ""Haha, true. Slippers are great for lounging, less so for, you know, construction sites. What color are they?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""They call it ""earth."" Which is basically brown. But a slightly more interesting brown. Like...mud brown?""
[Message 24] Jamie: ""Mud brown! Okay, I'm officially invested. Get them!""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Alright, alright, you've convinced me. I'm gonna grab them. Then I need coffee. All this shoe shopping is exhausting.""
[Message 26] Jamie: ""Coffee is essential. I'm fueling up on tea to prepare for the Great Plant Rescue of 2024.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""May the tea be strong! I'll text you later. Gonna go pay for these bad boys.""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""Sounds good! Good luck, and may your feet be forever protected.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Thanks! Later!""
[Message 30] Jamie: ""Bye!""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Okay, shoes acquired. Now, the quest for caffeine. There's a Starbucks across the street.""
[Message 32] Jamie: ""Starbucks is always a good option. Unless you're feeling adventurous and want to try that new local place down the street.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Ooh, adventurous. What's it called?""
[Message 34] Jamie: ""It's called 'The Daily Grind.' Supposedly their cold brew is amazing.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Hmm, 'The Daily Grind'...tempting. Okay, I'm feeling brave. Daily Grind it is!""
[Message 36] Jamie: ""Yes! Let me know what you think. I might need a caffeine fix later myself.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Will do! Heading there now. Hopefully, it's not too crowded.""
[Message 38] Jamie: ""Fingers crossed! So, aside from shoe shopping and book club complaining, anything else exciting happening in your life?""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Not really. Been working on that new sculpture, but I'm stuck on the base. Can't decide what material to use.""
[Message 40] Jamie: ""Ooh, what's the sculpture of?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""It's a sort of abstract representation of a raven. Lots of curves and sharp angles.""
[Message 42] Jamie: ""Sounds amazing! Maybe a dark wood for the base? Like walnut or mahogany?""
[Message 43] Alex: ""I was thinking wood, but I'm worried it might be too heavy. The sculpture itself is pretty light.""
[Message 44] Jamie: ""Hmm, what about metal? Like a brushed steel or bronze?""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Metal is a good idea! I have some scrap steel lying around. I could try that.""
[Message 46] Jamie: ""Perfect! Repurposing is the best. Okay, back to Barnaby. He's now trying to climb the curtains.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Oh, Barnaby! He's a busy little guy. Good luck with the curtain rescue!""
[Message 48] Jamie: ""Thanks! He's like a tiny, furry tornado. I swear, I need a vacation.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""I hear you. We all need a vacation. Maybe we should plan one after book club?""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""That's a fantastic idea! Where should we go? Somewhere far away from flowery swamps and sourdough-eating dogs.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Somewhere sunny and beachy? Or maybe a cabin in the mountains?""
[Message 52] Jamie: ""Ooh, both sound amazing! Let's brainstorm after the book club meeting. We deserve it.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Agreed! Okay, I'm at The Daily Grind. It smells AMAZING in here.""
[Message 54] Jamie: ""Ooh, jealous! What are you getting?""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Gonna try the cold brew, of course. And maybe a pastry. They have these chocolate croissants that are calling my name.""
[Message 56] Jamie: ""Chocolate croissants are always a good choice. Treat yourself!""
[Message 57] Alex: ""I will! Okay, gotta go order. Talk to you later!""
[Message 58] Jamie: ""Enjoy! Bye!""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Okay, cold brew acquired! And croissant. This is the life.""
[Message 60] Jamie: ""Living the dream! How's the cold brew?""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Seriously good. Really smooth and strong. Definitely worth the trip.""
[Message 62] Jamie: ""Awesome! I'm adding that to my list of places to try. So, about that steel base...could you weld something together?""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Yeah, I can weld. I could make a sort of cage-like base? That might be interesting.""
[Message 64] Jamie: ""Ooh, a cage-like base! That sounds very cool. It could echo the raven's sharp angles.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Exactly! I'll sketch some ideas tonight. Thanks for the inspiration!""
[Message 66] Jamie: ""Anytime! I'm just glad I could help. Now, if only I could figure out how to keep Barnaby from eating my furniture...""
[Message 67] Alex: ""Haha, maybe get him a chew toy made of indestructible material? Like, forged from the heart of a dying star?""
[Message 68] Jamie: ""I wish! Maybe I'll just wrap everything in bubble wrap. That's stylish, right?""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Totally! High fashion. Okay, gotta go. Gotta get back to the site. These mud-brown shoes are calling my name.""
[Message 70] Jamie: ""Go forth and conquer, in your mud-brown glory! Talk to you later!""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Later!""
[Message 72] Jamie: ""Hey, just wanted to ask, did you ever get those new gloves you were talking about?""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Oh, good question! No, I totally forgot. Need to add that to my shopping list. Thanks for the reminder!""
[Message 74] Jamie: ""No problem! I always forget things too. My memory is shot.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""Mine too! Age is a cruel mistress. And sometimes a forgetful one.""
[Message 76] Jamie: ""Haha, true! Okay, back to the Barnaby situation. He's now discovered the joys of shredding paper.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Oh, no! Not the paper! Is it important paper?""
[Message 78] Jamie: ""Thankfully, no. Just junk mail. But still! The mess!""
[Message 79] Alex: ""Ugh, the mess. I feel your pain. I once came home to find my cat had redecorated my entire apartment with toilet paper.""
[Message 80] Jamie: ""Oh my god! That's amazing and horrifying all at once. A toilet paper apocalypse!""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Exactly! Took me hours to clean up. I swear, pets are a mixed blessing.""
[Message 82] Jamie: ""Definitely. But we love them anyway, right?""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Of course! Even when they're being tiny, furry menaces.""
[Message 84] Jamie: ""Exactly! Well, I'm off to vacuum up a mountain of shredded paper. Wish me luck!""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Good luck! May the vacuum be strong and your patience even stronger.""
[Message 86] Jamie: ""Thanks! I'll need it. Talk to you later!""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Later!""
[Message 88] Alex: ""Just had the weirdest thing happen at the site. A bird landed on my head. A robin, I think.""
[Message 89] Jamie: ""A robin on your head! That's either incredibly lucky or incredibly unlucky. I'm not sure which.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""I'm leaning towards unlucky. It pooped on my hard hat.""
[Message 91] Jamie: ""Okay, yeah, definitely unlucky. Maybe buy a lottery ticket? You've used up all your bad luck for the day.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""Good idea! I'll stop on the way home. Thanks for the advice!""
[Message 93] Jamie: ""Anytime! So, steel base...are you thinking polished or more of a raw look?""
[Message 94] Alex: ""Hmm, raw might be cool. It would give it a sort of industrial feel.""
[Message 95] Jamie: ""Yeah! And it would contrast nicely with the more refined raven sculpture.""
[Message 96] Alex: ""I'm liking the sound of that more and more. I might try to find some rusty steel. That would be even better.""
[Message 97] Jamie: ""Rusty steel! Yes! You're a genius! Okay, I'm getting excited about this sculpture now.""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Me too! I'm actually looking forward to getting back to it after work.""
[Message 99] Jamie: ""That's awesome! It's always great when you're inspired.""
[Message 100] Alex: ""Totally! It makes the work feel less like work and more like play.""
[Message 101] Jamie: ""Exactly! Well, I'm off to battle the paper monster again. I think it's multiplying.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""Oh no! Good luck! May the odds be ever in your favor.""
[Message 103] Jamie: ""Haha, thanks! I'll need all the luck I can get. Talk to you later!""
[Message 104] Alex: ""Later!""
[Message 105] Alex: ""Hey, just saw a sign for a sculpting workshop at the community center. Thought of you!""
[Message 106] Jamie: ""Ooh, really? What kind of sculpting?""
[Message 107] Alex: ""It's a clay sculpting workshop. Looks like it's for beginners.""
[Message 108] Jamie: ""Hmm, tempting! I've always wanted to try clay sculpting.""
[Message 109] Alex: ""We should sign up! It would be fun.""
[Message 110] Jamie: ""Okay, I'm in! When is it?""
[Message 111] Alex: ""It's next Saturday morning. I'll send you the link to the registration page.""
[Message 112] Jamie: ""Awesome! Thanks! I'm excited! Maybe we can make little Barnaby sculptures.""
[Message 113] Alex: ""Haha, yes! Tiny Barnaby armies! Okay, I'm sending the link now.""
[Message 114] Jamie: ""Got it! I'm signing up now. This is going to be great!""
[Message 115] Alex: ""I know! I'm already picturing our masterpieces.""
[Message 116] Jamie: ""Me too! Okay, all signed up! Thanks for letting me know about it!""
[Message 117] Alex: ""No problem! I'm glad you're doing it! It'll be a nice break from paper shredding and sourdough emergencies.""
[Message 118] Jamie: ""Definitely! Okay, gotta go. The paper monster is calling my name again. It's relentless.""
[Message 119] Alex: ""Haha! Good luck! I'll see you next Saturday at the workshop!""
[Message 120] Jamie: ""Sounds good! See you then!""

14,"[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey guys, did you hear about what happened at the ATM last night?
[Message 2] MARK: Yeah, crazy stuff. Dayton's getting rough.
[Message 3] ANNA: I know, right? Makes you scared to go out at night. Who was it?
[Message 4] DAVID: Some security guard, I heard. Name was Alex.
[Message 5] FRANK: Alex? I think I saw him last week. Seemed alright.
[Message 6] CHLOE: So sad. Anyone know any details?
[Message 7] MARK: Just that it was at the ATM on Main Street.
[Message 8] ANNA: I saw Sarah arguing with someone near there yesterday.
[Message 9] DAVID: Sarah? What were they arguing about?
[Message 10] FRANK: Probably nothing. Sarah gets into arguments with everyone.
[Message 11] CHLOE: Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. It's awful for Alex's family.
[Message 12] MARK: Agreed. Any word on suspects?
[Message 13] ANNA: Not that I've heard. Just rumors.
[Message 14] DAVID: I heard the security cameras were down.
[Message 15] FRANK: That's convenient. Makes you wonder.
[Message 16] CHLOE: Frank, seriously, stop.
[Message 17] MARK: Anyone up for pizza tonight? Distract ourselves from this mess?
[Message 18] ANNA: Sounds good!
[Message 19] DAVID: I'm in.
[Message 20] FRANK: Count me out. Gotta work late.
[Message 21] CHLOE: Okay, see you guys later.
[Message 22] MARK: Later, Chloe.
[Message 23] ANNA: Bye!
[Message 24] DAVID: Peace.
[Message 25] FRANK: Later.
[Message 26] CHLOE: Frank, you okay? You seem on edge.
[Message 27] FRANK: Just tired, Chloe. Long day.
[Message 28] CHLOE: Okay. Just checking.
[Message 29] MARK: Hey Anna, you remember that business proposal David was working on?
[Message 30] ANNA: Vaguely. Why?
[Message 31] MARK: I heard Alex, the security guard, found out something about it. Something shady.
[Message 32] ANNA: Interesting...
[Message 33] DAVID: Guys, anyone know a good lawyer? Hypothetically speaking, of course.
[Message 34] MARK: Hypothetically? Why?
[Message 35] ANNA: Spill, David.
[Message 36] DAVID: Just doing some research for a friend.
[Message 37] FRANK: What kind of research?
[Message 38] DAVID: Just...legal stuff.
[Message 39] CHLOE: Something about lawyers? Getting worried David?
[Message 40] MARK: Yeah, what gives?
[Message 41] DAVID: Guys, I'm at a loss here. How could anyone do this? I knew Alex!
[Message 42] ANNA: Maybe you can go give a statement to the police, David.
[Message 43] DAVID: Maybe I will.
[Message 44] FRANK: Hey Mark, you still have that contact for... getting rid of things?
[Message 45] MARK: What? No! What are you talking about, Frank? That's messed up.
[Message 46] FRANK: Just asking. No need to get defensive.
[Message 47] CHLOE: What things? Getting rid of what things?
[Message 48] MARK: Nothing, Chloe. Just ignore him.
[Message 49] ANNA: Sounds suspicious to me.
[Message 50] DAVID: Frank, that's a terrible thing to say, especially now!
[Message 51] FRANK: Relax, I'm kidding! Bad joke.
[Message 52] CHLOE: Not funny, Frank. Not funny at all.
[Message 53] FRANK: Sorry, okay? Seriously.
[Message 54] MARK: So, about that pizza...
[Message 55] ANNA: Yeah, let's drop this. Pizza time.
[Message 56] DAVID: I could really use a distraction.
[Message 57] CHLOE: Pizza sounds good.
[Message 58] CHLOE: David, do you know Sarah well?
[Message 59] DAVID: Sarah? Not really. Why?
[Message 60] CHLOE: Just wondering.
[Message 61] MARK: Has anyone heard from Sarah since all this happened?
[Message 62] ANNA: Good point, I haven't.
[Message 63] DAVID: Now that you mention it... no.
[Message 64] FRANK: Probably just laying low.
[Message 65] CHLOE: Hope she's okay.
[Message 66] MARK: Me too.
[Message 67] ANNA: Someone should check on her.
[Message 68] DAVID: Maybe later.
[Message 69] FRANK: Guys, I gotta go. Really busy.
[Message 70] CHLOE: Bye, Frank.
[Message 71] MARK: Later.
[Message 72] ANNA: See ya.
[Message 73] DAVID: Later, Frank.
[Message 74] CHLOE: Did you guys see Frank's old car?
[Message 75] MARK: Yeah, what about it?
[Message 76] ANNA: Thought he was getting rid of it.
[Message 77] DAVID: I thought so too. Haven't seen it around lately.
[Message 78] MARK: Guys, this is all too much. Can we change the subject?
[Message 79] CHLOE: Right, sorry.
[Message 80] ANNA: My bad.
[Message 81] DAVID: Agreed.
[Message 82] MARK: Anyone watching the game tonight?
[Message 83] ANNA: Maybe. Depends.
[Message 84] DAVID: I'll probably catch it.
[Message 85] CHLOE: I might.
[Message 86] MARK: Cool.
[Message 87] ANNA: Okay, good talk. I'm gonna go.
[Message 88] DAVID: Later.
[Message 89] CHLOE: Bye.
[Message 90] MARK: Peace.
[Message 91] CHLOE: David, was Sarah angry about her hours being cut? She mentioned it to me.
[Message 92] DAVID: Maybe. It was a tough situation.
[Message 93] MARK: I did notice David fired Sarah, she probably did intend to do something about it.
[Message 94] CHLOE: So, Mark, how was your visit to the ATM last night?
[Message 95] MARK: Chloe, what are you implying? I have an alibi.
[Message 96] ANNA: I bet David knew what was going on. He purposefully didn't help Sarah when she asked for a raise.
[Message 97] DAVID: I'm not feeling good. I won't sleep for days because of this.
[Message 98] CHLOE: You'd go away for a long time, you know that right?
[Message 99] MARK: Guys this whole thing is bad for business, David, you could have just given her the raise.
[Message 100] DAVID: I'm shocked, I would never have thought that one of my old friends killed Alex.
[Message 101] ANNA: Oh so now Alex is your friend?
[Message 102] DAVID: I was friends with him, but he deserved it, he probably knew about the embezzlement.
[Message 103] CHLOE: How did he die anyway?
[Message 104] MARK: I heard that the injection failed, so there were probably other circumstances involved.
[Message 105] ANNA: That means it wasn't a one person job.
[Message 106] DAVID: Now your aware? I thought you wanted to get away with it.
[Message 107] CHLOE: You are trying to pass the blame onto me.
[Message 108] MARK: Chloe do you regret it? You could make this better.
[Message 109] ANNA: You should have called 911, your shouts probably provoked him.
[Message 110] DAVID: It was all a mistake.
[Message 111] CHLOE: I'm going to call the police, you guys are nuts.
[Message 112] MARK: No don't, they will give you the death penalty.
[Message 113] ANNA: I didn't do anything, I didn't even know what you were talking about.
[Message 114] DAVID: Don't lie, I tried to talk you out of it.
[Message 115] CHLOE: I knew that he always hated Alex.
[Message 116] MARK: He was looking up on how to make lethal Administering a lethal injection online.
[Message 117] ANNA: We were just researching, it never happened, its just a coincidence.
[Message 118] DAVID: So you admit there was an attempt?
[Message 119] CHLOE: I think we should all get off the phone now.
[Message 120] MARK: No lets all stick together.
[Message 121] ANNA: Yeah, and then the cops can come and take all of us to jail, sounds like a great idea Mark!
[Message 122] DAVID: This is a bad joke, you guys planned this all along, didn't you!
[Message 123] CHLOE: This is the last time I will ever trust any of you, good bye.
[Message 124] MARK: Good bye Chloe, hope they don't take you away for a long time.
[Message 125] ANNA: Yeah, because you will be there with them!
[Message 126] DAVID: This is the end of our lives.
[Message 127] CHLOE: See you in hell.
[Message 128] MARK: See you there.
[Message 129] ANNA: Good bye.

[Message 2] Bob: ""Morning, Agnes! Sun's out, birds are singing. A beautiful Glendale morning!""
[Message 3] Carol: ""Morning! Ready for a busy day. Did anyone catch that interview with George Clooney last night?""
[Message 4] David: ""Morning all. No, Carol, I missed it. What was he talking about?""
[Message 5] Carol: ""Just promoting his new movie, but he was also talking about his kids. Seems like a really down-to-earth guy.""
[Message 6] Agnes: ""I always thought he seemed genuine. Remember when he used to be on ER?""
[Message 7] Bob: ""ER! That was a long time ago. He's definitely come a long way since then.""
[Message 8] David: ""He has. Speaking of celebrities, did you all see that photo of Brad Pitt looking… different?""
[Message 9] Carol: ""Oh yeah! With the new haircut? What do you think?""
[Message 10] David: ""I don't know… I think he's trying too hard to look young. Just embrace the grey hair, Brad!""
[Message 11] Agnes: ""He's still handsome, though! Age is just a number.""
[Message 12] Bob: ""True, true. And he's probably got a team of people telling him what to do.""
[Message 13] Carol: ""Probably! It's all about the image, isn't it? Have any of you been to that new cafe down the street?""
[Message 14] David: ""Not yet, Carol. Is it any good?""
[Message 15] Carol: ""I heard the coffee is amazing. Maybe we can grab a cup there sometime this week?""
[Message 16] Agnes: ""That sounds lovely. I'm free Wednesday afternoon.""
[Message 17] Bob: ""I could do Wednesday. We should definitely check it out.""
[Message 18] David: ""Wednesday works for me too. Back to celebrities – I saw Meryl Streep at a networking event once.""
[Message 19] Carol: ""Wow! Meryl Streep? What was she like?""
[Message 20] David: ""She was surprisingly shy. Very polite, but definitely kept to herself.""
[Message 21] Agnes: ""That's interesting. You'd think she'd be super outgoing.""
[Message 22] Bob: ""Maybe she's just a private person. Not everyone wants to be 'on' all the time.""
[Message 23] Carol: ""True. Thinking of networking, I'm going to that art gallery opening next weekend.""
[Message 24] Agnes: ""Oh, which gallery?""
[Message 25] Carol: ""The one on Brand Boulevard. Apparently, a pretty famous sculptor is showcasing their work.""
[Message 26] David: ""Sculpting? That's cool. I admire people with artistic talent.""
[Message 27] Bob: ""Me too! I can barely draw a stick figure.""
[Message 28] Agnes: ""I enjoy a bit of dancing myself. It's a good way to express yourself.""
[Message 29] Carol: ""I agree. Dancing is such a freeing experience. Speaking of freeing...have you seen Lady Gaga's new look?""
[Message 30] David: ""No, what's she done now?""
[Message 31] Carol: ""She's gone all natural. No makeup, just her natural hair. She looks amazing!""
[Message 32] Agnes: ""Good for her! It's nice to see celebrities embracing their natural beauty.""
[Message 33] Bob: ""Yeah, it's a refreshing change from all the filters and photoshop.""
[Message 34] David: ""It is. Makes them seem more relatable, in a way. But honestly, it's still a constructed image, just a different one.""
[Message 35] Carol: ""True, David, very true. But still, a good message for younger fans.""
[Message 36] Agnes: ""Definitely. I remember when I was younger, I used to compare myself to celebrities all the time.""
[Message 37] Bob: ""We all did, Agnes. The pressure to look a certain way was immense.""
[Message 38] David: ""It still is, for young people especially. The impact of social media is huge.""
[Message 39] Carol: ""Exactly. And with the rise of AI, who knows what's real anymore?""
[Message 40] Agnes: ""That's a scary thought. I'm glad I'm not growing up in this era.""
[Message 41] Bob: ""Me too, Agnes, me too. Less complicated times, I think.""
[Message 42] David: ""Maybe. Every generation faces its own challenges. Even Sinatra faced AI... wait, no, he didn't.""
[Message 43] Carol: ""Haha, good one, David! Speaking of music, has anyone listened to the new Taylor Swift album?""
[Message 44] Agnes: ""Oh yes! I'm quite enjoying it. Very catchy.""
[Message 45] Bob: ""I haven't yet, but I've heard good things. My granddaughter is obsessed.""
[Message 46] David: ""Not really my kind of music, but I appreciate her talent and business acumen.""
[Message 47] Carol: ""She's definitely a force to be reckoned with. Okay, enough about celebrities, anyone got any fun plans for the weekend?""
[Message 48] Agnes: ""I'm planning on going dancing on Friday night at the senior center.""
[Message 49] Bob: ""Sounds like fun, Agnes! I might try to work on my singing.""
[Message 50] David: ""I'm thinking of visiting a car show. It's been a while since I've seen some classic cars.""
[Message 51] Carol: ""That sounds interesting, David. I might work on a new sculpture.""
[Message 52] Agnes: ""You're so talented, Carol! I always admire your creations.""
[Message 53] Bob: ""Absolutely. Your sculptures are amazing, Carol.""
[Message 54] David: ""Agreed! It's inspiring to see someone so dedicated to their art.""
[Message 55] Carol: ""Thank you all! That means a lot to me. It's always nice to have encouragement.""
[Message 56] Agnes: ""Of course! We should all support each other's passions.""
[Message 57] Bob: ""Definitely. Life's too short to not pursue what you love.""
[Message 58] David: ""Hear, hear! Now, back to the Clooney interview...""
[Message 59] Carol: ""Oh, David, you're still stuck on that! I told you everything important.""
[Message 60] David: ""I just wanted to hear about the kids! Apparently they are learning Italian?""
[Message 61] Agnes: ""How lovely! Multilingual children, very impressive.""
[Message 62] Bob: ""Indeed. It opens up so many opportunities for them.""
[Message 63] Carol: ""Totally! And you know what else is impressive? Jennifer Lopez still dancing like that at her age!""
[Message 64] Agnes: ""She's got incredible energy. Must be all that dancing!""
[Message 65] Bob: ""Or a really good trainer! Probably both.""
[Message 66] David: ""It's discipline. She clearly takes care of herself.""
[Message 67] Carol: ""Discipline and a whole lot of money, probably! But still, she's a role model.""
[Message 68] Agnes: ""A role model for staying active and pursuing your passions, certainly.""
[Message 69] Bob: ""Absolutely! Though, I'm not sure I could keep up with her dance moves!""
[Message 70] David: ""Me neither. I'd probably pull a muscle just trying to stand up straight.""
[Message 71] Carol: ""Haha! We all have our strengths, David. You're great with those cars!""
[Message 72] Agnes: ""Yes, David, we appreciate your knowledge of automobiles!""
[Message 73] Bob: ""Definitely! Always interesting conversations.""
[Message 74] David: ""Well, thank you. I do enjoy a good car conversation. Did you know the new Corvette is...""
[Message 75] Carol: ""Oh, here we go! Car talk incoming!""
[Message 76] Agnes: ""I'm ready! Tell us all about it, David.""
[Message 77] Bob: ""I'm more of a classic car guy myself, but I'm always interested to hear about new technology.""
[Message 78] David: ""Well, the new Corvette is a mid-engine sports car, which is a big departure for the brand...""
[Message 79] Carol: ""Mid-engine? What does that even mean?""
[Message 80] Agnes: ""It means the engine is located in the middle of the car, instead of in the front.""
[Message 81] Bob: ""That helps with handling and balance, I believe.""
[Message 82] David: ""Exactly! It improves the car's performance significantly.""
[Message 83] Carol: ""Interesting. So it's like a race car?""
[Message 84] David: ""In some ways, yes. But it's also a very comfortable and luxurious car.""
[Message 85] Agnes: ""Sounds expensive!""
[Message 86] Bob: ""I'm sure it is! But it sounds very impressive, David.""
[Message 87] David: ""It is. And it's a testament to how far automotive technology has come. Kinda like how far George Clooney has come!""
[Message 88] Carol: ""Haha! Full circle back to George! Okay everyone, I need to run. Have a great day!""

[Message 73] Taylor: ""I think I saw something about farmers markets and outdoor movie nights.""
[Message 74] Jordan: ""Oh, that's perfect! I love outdoor movies.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""Me too! It's such a fun way to spend an evening.""
[Message 76] Taylor: ""Yeah, and farmers markets are great for getting fresh, local produce.""

[Message 85] Alex: ""So, Jordan, you catching up on any good shows lately?""
[Message 86] Jordan: ""Actually, yeah! I started watching 'Abbott Elementary'. It's hilarious.""
[Message 87] Alex: ""I've heard good things about that. I might have to check it out.""
[Message 88] Jordan: ""You should! It's really well-written and the cast is amazing.""
[Message 89] Alex: ""Cool. I'm always looking for something new to watch.""
[Message 90] Jordan: ""Me too. I get bored easily. What about you, Alex? Anything good on your radar?""
[Message 91] Alex: ""I've been re-watching 'The Good Place'. Still holds up.""
[Message 92] Jordan: ""Oh, that's a classic! Such a clever show.""
[Message 93] Alex: ""It is! And it always makes me think.""
[Message 94] Jordan: ""Same here. Okay, I think I'm finally done pumping gas. This took forever.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""Tell me about it. I'm about to head out too.""

[Message 101] Alex: ""Oh, I almost forgot! Did you hear about the new coffee shop opening on Peachtree?""
[Message 102] Jordan: ""No! Where on Peachtree?""
[Message 103] Alex: ""Near the Fox Theatre, I think. Supposed to have amazing cold brew.""
[Message 104] Jordan: ""Ooh, I'll have to check that out. I'm always on the hunt for good coffee.""
[Message 105] Alex: ""Same here. I'll send you the address when I find it.""

[Message 113] Alex: ""Night!""
[Message 114] Jordan: ""Maybe we can all grab coffee at that new place sometime!""

[Message 1] Alex: Hey, have you guys heard about what happened to Brenda?

[Message 2] Jamie: Yeah, it's all over the news. So messed up.

[Message 3] Riley: I saw her just last week. Crazy.

[Message 4] Alex: At Bridge? Was it late?

[Message 5] Riley: Yeah, around 9pm. Why?

[Message 6] Jamie: Alex always has to be a detective lol.

[Message 7] Alex: I just feel bad. She was just doing her job.

[Message 8] Jamie: True. She was a corrections officer. Dangerous job.

[Message 9] Riley: I heard they found an ice pick. Gruesome.

[Message 10] Alex: An ice pick? Seriously? Where did they even get that?

[Message 11] Jamie: My dad said there's a hardware store near Bridge. Maybe from there.

[Message 12] Riley: Weird. I saw Jamie buying something that looked like Stabbing with an ice pick there yesterday. It seemed like she purposefully did it.

[Message 13] Jamie: Riley, that's not even funny! I bought a garden tool, not an ice pick. My ankles have been so swollen and I needed something to help me get around in the garden.

[Message 14] Alex: Seriously, guys, let's not start pointing fingers. Brenda is dead.

[Message 15] Jamie: Alex is right. It's awful. I heard she was really ambitious. Wanted to be warden someday.

[Message 16] Riley: Warden material for sure. So... who do you think did it?

[Message 17] Alex: I don't know. Someone she put away, maybe?

[Message 18] Jamie: Or maybe someone she knew outside of work.

[Message 19] Riley: I overheard a weird conversation between Jamie and Brenda before the incident. Jamie looked really upset and was shouting. I felt like she wanted to get rid of her.

[Message 20] Jamie: Riley, you are twisting things. I had a disagreement with Brenda about an issue from the past, but I didn't hate her.

[Message 21] Alex: What was the disagreement about?

[Message 22] Jamie: None of your business, Alex.

[Message 23] Riley: Oooooh. Secrets!

[Message 24] Alex: Guys, come on. Brenda's family is grieving. This isn't a game.

[Message 25] Jamie: What time did it happen, anyway? I heard it was late at Night.

[Message 26] Riley: The news said it was after 11 pm. If she hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.

[Message 27] Alex: So late. Hope they don't get the death penalty for this.

[Message 28] Jamie: It was at Bridge. I drive down that street every day. That intersection is always so dark.

[Message 29] Riley: I was at the Bridge last Night around 10:45. I saw Alex leave the building at Night.

[Message 30] Alex: That's insane Riley! I was at home all night! I was looking up how to make ice sculptures online.

[Message 31] Jamie: You think she had enemies?

[Message 32] Alex: I would assume that being a corrections officer has risks.

[Message 33] Riley: I knew it. I knew there was something weird there.

[Message 34] Jamie: I'm going to stay out of this one, i don't want any troubles for myself.

[Message 35] Alex: Let's just let the police handle it. This is getting out of hand.",1,

[Message 47] Marcus: ""Well, we're here if you need us.""
[Message 48] Delilah: ""Thanks. I appreciate that.""
[Message 49] Kai: ""Seriously, don't hesitate to reach out.""
[Message 50] Delilah: ""I won't. I just… I feel like I'm losing it.""
[Message 51] Marcus: ""Losing it how?""
[Message 52] Delilah: ""Like… like I want to just… disappear.""
[Message 53] Kai: ""Delilah, don't say that. You matter.""

[Message 55] Delilah: ""Do you, really?""
[Message 56] Kai: ""Of course, we do! What's with all the negativity?""

[Message 59] Kai: ""Then tell us! We can't help if we don't know.""
[Message 60] Marcus: ""Exactly. Open up.""
[Message 61] Delilah: ""I can't. It's too much.""
[Message 62] Kai: ""Too much for what? For us to help?""
[Message 63] Marcus: ""Don't shut us out, Delilah.""
[Message 64] Delilah: ""Fine. But don't say I didn't warn you.""

[Message 67] Delilah: ""Never mind. It's nothing.""

[Message 70] Delilah: ""I'm not playing games! I'm just… scared.""

[Message 97] Liam: ""Yeah, I knew her. Why?""

[Message 99] Liam: ""No, not that I recall. Sarah was pretty well-liked. Why are you asking?""
[Message 100] Kai: ""Just curious. Trying to understand what happened. It is unusual for a journalist to be targeted.""

[Message 102] Kai: ""Sure thing. Later.""
[Message 103] Marcus: ""Kai, did you hear back from Delilah?""

[Message 108] Zara: ""Liam, this game is intense! I'm losing horribly.""
[Message 109] Liam: ""Haha, don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. So, what do you think about that fire?""
[Message 110] Zara: ""Awful. Absolutely awful. I can't believe someone would do that. Especially to Sarah and the social worker.""
[Message 111] Liam: ""Yeah, it's messed up. Do you think it was some kind of accident?""
[Message 112] Zara: ""Arson isn't an accident, Liam. Someone purposefully set it.""
[Message 113] Liam: ""Right, right. Just… hard to believe.""
[Message 114] Zara: ""I know. So sad for their families. The social worker was named Emily.""
[Message 115] Liam: ""Emily, right. Terrible. I heard a rumor that Emily was sleeping with someone.""
[Message 116] Zara: ""Woah Liam. That's a pretty big accusation! I don't think there's any point in spreading false information right now. We should leave it to the Police.""
[Message 117] Liam: ""Sorry. I didn't mean to spread anything. That's just something I heard.""
[Message 118] Marcus: ""Delilah's not answering the door.""
[Message 119] Kai: ""Keep knocking.""
[Message 120] Marcus: ""I am. I'm starting to get really worried.""

[Message 122] Marcus: ""Her car's here. And the window is open. That's not like her.""
[Message 123] Kai: ""Open window? That's not good. Try the door.""
[Message 124] Marcus: ""It's unlocked. Should we go in?""
[Message 125] Kai: ""Yeah, we have to. Something's not right.""
[Message 126] Marcus: ""Okay, here we go…""
[Message 127] Kai: ""What do you see?""
[Message 128] Marcus: ""She's… she's on the floor. Unconscious.""
[Message 129] Kai: ""Oh my god! Call 911!""
[Message 130] Marcus: ""Already dialing!""
[Message 131] Kai: ""Is she breathing?""
[Message 132] Marcus: ""Barely. This is bad, Kai, really bad.""
[Message 133] Kai: ""Just stay calm. The ambulance is on its way.""
[Message 134] Marcus: ""I don't know what happened. There's no sign of a struggle.""
[Message 135] Kai: ""Maybe she overdosed?""
[Message 136] Marcus: ""I don't know. She wouldn't do that, would she?""
[Message 137] Kai: ""People do desperate things when they're in pain.""
[Message 138] Marcus: ""True. But she always hated 4.  Journalist. I wonder why.""
[Message 139] Kai: ""Wait, what? What do you mean she hated the journalist?""
[Message 140] Marcus: ""Nothing. Just… she mentioned it once. A long time ago.""
[Message 141] Kai: ""Marcus, you can't just drop that and say it's nothing! What did she say?""
[Message 142] Marcus: ""I don't remember exactly. Just that she didn't like her articles.""
[Message 143] Kai: ""That's it? That's all you've got?""
[Message 144] Marcus: ""Yeah, that's it. Look, the ambulance is here. I gotta go.""
[Message 145] Kai: ""Fine. Keep me updated.""
[Message 146] Liam: ""Zara, you okay? You seem distracted.""
[Message 147] Zara: ""Just thinking about Delilah. Hope she's alright.""
[Message 148] Liam: ""Yeah, that's rough. I always thought Delilah had a thing for fame or notoriety. It was only a matter of time before she did something.""
[Message 149] Zara: ""Liam! What a horrible thing to say! You don't know that, and it wasn't her that the ambulance came for! How could you say that?!""
[Message 150] Liam: ""Sorry, sorry. I didn't mean it like that. It's just... she always seemed a little off to me.""
[Message 151] Zara: ""That doesn't mean she's a criminal, Liam! You can't just judge people like that.""
[Message 152] Liam: ""I know, I know. I'm just… stressed out about everything. The fire, Delilah, everything.""
[Message 153] Zara: ""Me too. But that's no excuse for making insensitive comments.""
[Message 154] Liam: ""You're right. I apologize.""
[Message 155] Zara: ""Apology accepted. Now, can we please try to enjoy the game?""
[Message 156] Liam: ""Yeah, let's do it.""
[Message 157] Kai: ""Marcus, any news?""
[Message 158] Marcus: ""She's in the hospital. They're saying it was an overdose.""
[Message 159] Kai: ""Damn it. I knew it. But still, Sarah and Emily? What do you think?""
[Message 160] Marcus: ""It's suspicious, that's for sure. I saw him leave the building at Late Evening and I haven't been able to shake that feeling ever since.""
[Message 161] Kai: ""Who? Who did you see?""
[Message 162] Marcus: ""Liam. He was acting real weird. And he always hated 4.  Journalist.""
[Message 163] Kai: ""Liam? Really? Did you tell the cops?""
[Message 164] Marcus: ""Not yet. I wanted to talk to you first. But if he caused any harm to Sarah or Emily, he needs to be punished.""
[Message 165] Kai: ""You did the right thing. We need to be careful. But if Liam did have some intention to harm them, the cops need to know. We have to find Delilah.""
[Message 166] Marcus: ""We will. Together. Thanks for believing me.""
[Message 167] Kai: ""Always. I'm going to call the police now. You stay with Delilah.""
[Message 168] Marcus: ""Okay. Be careful.""
[Message 169] Kai: ""You too.""
[Message 170] Liam: ""Zara, I really am sorry about what I said earlier. It was out of line.""
[Message 171] Zara: ""It's okay, Liam. I understand you're stressed. But next time, think before you speak.""
[Message 172] Liam: ""I will. I promise. How about we order some pizza? My treat.""
[Message 173] Zara: ""That sounds good. Maybe something with extra cheese?""
[Message 174] Liam: ""You got it.""
[Message 175] Zara: ""Thanks, Liam. I appreciate it.""
[Message 176] Liam: ""Anything for you, Zara.""
[Message 177] Liam: ""So what do you think about all of this happening?""
[Message 178] Zara: ""It makes me very sad.""
[Message 179] Liam: ""Yea, me too.""
[Message 180] Liam: ""What happens to Delilah after this?""
[Message 181] Zara: ""That's hard to say.""
[Message 182] Zara: ""At least she is still with us. Unlike Sarah and Emily.""

[Message 15] Taylor: ""Snacks and tea sound amazing! You guys are the best. Oh hey, did anyone catch the game last night?""
[Message 16] Alex: ""Game? Nah, I was too busy trying to figure out how to fold a fitted sheet. An equally impossible task.""
[Message 17] Jamie: ""Fitted sheets are the bane of my existence. I just roll them up and hope for the best.""

[Message 52] Sam: ""Later, Alex! Back to the grind for me too.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Okay, just me then. Guess I'll be enjoying this coffee in solitude. But hey, at least it'll be quiet!""
[Message 54] Alex: ""Just kidding! Ran into River in the coffee line. Turns out she forgot her wallet. Coffee's on me!""
[Message 55] River: ""You're a lifesaver, Alex! Seriously, thank you! I owe you one.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""No problem, River! Glad I could help. Consider it payment for all the snacks you're bringing to crafting night.""
[Message 57] River: ""Deal! Okay, back to the meetings. See you all on Wednesday!""
[Message 58] Alex: ""See ya, River!""
[Message 59] Sam: ""Has anyone seen my stapler? I swear I just had it...""
[Message 60] Alex: ""Not me, Sam. Check under your desk?""
[Message 61] Sam: ""Good idea, Alex! BRB.""
[Message 62] Sam: ""Found it! It was hiding behind a stack of papers. Crisis averted.""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Glad to hear it! The mysteries of office supplies.""

[Message 65] Alex: ""Exactly! Okay, I'm officially signing off for lunch. Enjoy the rest of your day, everyone!""
[Message 66] Jamie: ""You too, Alex! Lunch sounds good.""
[Message 67] Sam: ""Have a good lunch, Alex! I'm going to try and convince myself to do some more origami.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Good luck with the origami, Sam! Maybe you'll make a whole flock of cranes by Wednesday.""
[Message 69] Sam: ""I'll try my best! Maybe I'll even make a little stapler-shaped one.""

21,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone! Just browsing at the bookstore. Anyone doing any crafting projects lately?
[Message 2] Riley: Hi Alex! As a matter of fact, yes! I'm attempting to knit a scarf. It's...challenging.
[Message 3] Jordan: Oh, knitting! I tried that once. Ended up with something that looked like a bird's nest. Good luck, Riley!
[Message 4] Sam: Haha, I feel that, Jordan. I'm more of a painting person myself. Watercolor, specifically.
[Message 5] Quinn: Painting sounds relaxing! I've been meaning to try it. I'm stuck on organizing my craft supplies right now. So. Much. Stuff.
[Message 6] Alex: Quinn, I totally get that. Craft supply organization is a beast. Any tips?
[Message 7] Riley: I use clear plastic bins, labeled meticulously. It helps...somewhat.
[Message 8] Jordan: Ooh, I like the clear bin idea. I mostly just shove everything in a closet and hope for the best.
[Message 9] Sam: That's my strategy too, Jordan! Out of sight, out of mind!
[Message 10] Quinn: Okay, clear bins are officially on my list. Thanks, Riley!
[Message 11] Alex: I'm thinking about trying macrame. Anyone ever done that?
[Message 12] Riley: Macrame! That's making a comeback. I saw some cool plant hangers the other day.
[Message 13] Jordan: My grandma used to make macrame owls. They were...interesting.
[Message 14] Sam: Owls, huh? I've never tried it. Sounds complicated.
[Message 15] Quinn: Complicated but cool! I saw a macrame wall hanging on Etsy that was gorgeous.
[Message 16] Alex: Etsy is my crafting inspiration black hole. I spend way too much time browsing.
[Message 17] Riley: Same here, Alex! ""Oh, I could make that!"" ...two years later, still haven't.
[Message 18] Jordan: Accurate. Though sometimes I do get inspired and actually finish something. It's a rare occurrence, though.
[Message 19] Sam: I'm feeling inspired to try painting a landscape after this conversation.
[Message 20] Quinn: Go for it, Sam! Show us when you're done!
[Message 21] Alex: Yes, please do! I love seeing everyone's creations.
[Message 22] Riley: Me too! It's so inspiring.
[Message 23] Jordan: Absolutely! Share the art!
[Message 24] Sam: Will do! It might take a while, I'm still trying to figure out what colors I want to use.
[Message 25] Quinn: Color palettes are the best part!
[Message 26] Alex: Okay, so not exactly crafting related, but anyone have any good book recommendations? I'm at the bookstore, after all.
[Message 27] Riley: Ooh, what genre are you in the mood for, Alex?
[Message 28] Jordan: Seconding that, what are you looking for? Mystery? Sci-fi? Romance?
[Message 29] Sam: I just finished a really good biography. If you're into that sort of thing.
[Message 30] Quinn: I've been on a fantasy kick lately.
[Message 31] Alex: Hmm, maybe something lighthearted. I've been stressed lately.
[Message 32] Riley: Have you read anything by T.J. Klune? His books are usually pretty uplifting.
[Message 33] Jordan: I've heard good things about Klune!
[Message 34] Sam: Noted, adding that to my TBR (to be read) list.
[Message 35] Quinn: TBR lists are my nemesis. They just keep growing!
[Message 36] Alex: Haha, mine too, Quinn. Okay, I'll check out T.J. Klune. Thanks, Riley!
[Message 37] Riley: No problem! Hope you enjoy it!
[Message 38] Jordan: Back to crafting, has anyone tried making their own candles?
[Message 39] Sam: I've always wanted to try that! It seems a little intimidating, though.
[Message 40] Quinn: I saw a candle-making kit at the craft store the other day. Maybe that would be a good starting point?
[Message 41] Alex: That's a good idea, Quinn! Kits are always easier.
[Message 42] Riley: I've made candles before! It's actually pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Just be careful with the hot wax!
[Message 43] Jordan: Good to know! Any tips for choosing scents?
[Message 44] Sam: Ooh, I'm curious about that too!
[Message 45] Quinn: Scent recommendations, please!
[Message 46] Alex: I'm writing these tips down, this conversation is great!
[Message 47] Riley: I like using essential oils. Lavender and vanilla are always good choices.
[Message 48] Jordan: Lavender sounds lovely.
[Message 49] Sam: Vanilla, definitely. Comforting and warm.
[Message 50] Quinn: Okay, lavender and vanilla are on the list. Thanks!
[Message 51] Alex: So, shifting gears slightly, anyone got any fun plans for the weekend?
[Message 52] Riley: I'm thinking of going to the farmer's market.
[Message 53] Jordan: I'm hoping to finally finish that drawing I started last week.
[Message 54] Sam: I'm planning a movie night with some friends.
[Message 55] Quinn: I'm just going to chill and try to relax. Maybe do some crafting.
[Message 56] Alex: A relaxing weekend sounds amazing. I might just copy you, Quinn.
[Message 57] Riley: Sounds perfect!
[Message 58] Jordan: Enjoy your relaxing weekend, everyone!
[Message 59] Sam: You too!
[Message 60] Quinn: Thanks! You all have a great weekend as well!
[Message 61] Alex: Has anyone ever been on a crafting first date?
[Message 62] Riley: A crafting first date? That's actually a really cute idea!
[Message 63] Jordan: I haven't, but it sounds way more fun than just going to dinner.
[Message 64] Sam: Definitely more unique! What kind of crafting activity would you do?
[Message 65] Quinn: Maybe pottery painting? Or a simple jewelry-making class?
[Message 66] Alex: Those are good suggestions! I was thinking maybe a paint-and-sip?
[Message 67] Riley: Paint-and-sip is always a good time!
[Message 68] Jordan: I'd be a little nervous about making a mess, but it sounds fun!
[Message 69] Sam: Messes are part of the crafting experience! Embrace the chaos!
[Message 70] Quinn: True! A crafting date sounds like a great way to see someone's personality.
[Message 71] Alex: That's what I was thinking! Shows if they're patient, creative, and can handle a little mess.
[Message 72] Riley: I'm sold! I'm adding ""crafting date"" to my list of date ideas.
[Message 73] Jordan: Me too! Thanks for the inspiration, Alex!
[Message 74] Sam: This has been a very productive conversation!
[Message 75] Quinn: Agreed! Now I'm off to organize those craft supplies! Have a good night, everyone",0,

[Message 33] Alex: Greenfield Village? Not in ages! Is it still worth the trip?
[Message 34] Sarah: Absolutely! They have all sorts of historical exhibits. My grandson loves the Model T ride.
[Message 35] David: I haven't been since I was a kid myself. Maybe I'll take my granddaughter there next weekend.
[Message 36] Emily: I might go with you guys! I've always wanted to see the glassblowing demonstration.
[Message 37] Alex: Okay, okay, you've convinced me. Greenfield Village next weekend?
[Message 38] Sarah: Sounds like a plan! We should coordinate times so we can meet up.
[Message 39] David: Definitely! I'll text you guys my number.
[Message 40] Emily: Great! Mine's 555-1212.
[Message 41] Alex: I should probably get a newer phone… mine still has a number pad. Give me a minute…
[Message 42] Sarah: Haha, Alex! You're a classic.
[Message 43] David: Don't worry, Alex. Functionality over fashion!
[Message 44] Emily: Exactly! As long as it makes calls and sends texts, you're good.
[Message 45] Alex: Okay, okay, I'm coming into the 21st century… slowly. My number is 555-7878.
[Message 46] Sarah: Got it! Mine's 555-3434.
[Message 47] David: Perfect! Now we can all complain about the DMV more efficiently.
[Message 48] Emily: You said it! Anyone else craving a coney dog after this?
[Message 49] Alex: Coney dog? Always. That's the official food of surviving Detroit.
[Message 50] Sarah: I'm in! Lafayette or American?
[Message 51] David: Lafayette, every time! The snap of that natural casing… mmm.
[Message 52] Emily: I'm a fan of both, honestly. But Lafayette it is!
[Message 53] Alex: Alright, Lafayette it is. We're celebrating surviving the DMV with chili dogs!
[Message 54] Sarah: Sounds like a plan! I'll drive.
[Message 55] David: You're the best, Sarah! I'll navigate.
[Message 56] Emily: I'll provide the conversation!
[Message 57] Alex: And I'll provide the cynicism! Just kidding (mostly).
[Message 58] Sarah: Cynicism is welcome! We're all feeling it tonight.
[Message 59] David: Anyone else suddenly feel super hungry?
[Message 60] Emily: Starving! The anticipation is killing me.
[Message 61] Alex: Me too. This DMV experience has burned a lot of calories, I think.
[Message 62] Sarah: Definitely a mental workout. And a test of patience.
[Message 63] David: Speaking of workouts, I need to get back to the gym. Been slacking lately.
[Message 64] Emily: What kind of workouts do you do, David?
[Message 65] David: Mostly weightlifting and some cardio. Trying to stay active.
[Message 66] Alex: I'm more of a ""lifting heavy things at work"" kind of workout guy.
[Message 67] Sarah: I walk a lot. Chasing after my grandson is a workout in itself!
[Message 68] Emily: I like yoga and Pilates. Good for stretching and relaxation.
[Message 69] Alex: Relaxation sounds nice. I could use some of that.
[Message 70] Sarah: Me too. Maybe we should all try a yoga class sometime.
[Message 71] David: I'm open to it! I need to improve my flexibility.
[Message 72] Emily: I can recommend some good studios.
[Message 73] Alex: Okay, okay, yoga sounds… interesting. I'll consider it.
[Message 74] Sarah: Don't knock it 'til you try it!
[Message 75] David: Exactly! You might surprise yourself, Alex.
[Message 76] Emily: It's a good way to de-stress, for sure.
[Message 77] Alex: De-stressing sounds very appealing right now.
[Message 78] Sarah: We should make it a group thing! ""DMV Survivors Yoga Club.""
[Message 79] David: Haha! I love it!
[Message 80] Emily: That's the best name ever!
[Message 81] Alex: Okay, okay, I'm in. ""DMV Survivors Yoga Club."" Let's do it.
[Message 82] Sarah: Awesome! I'll look into some beginner classes.
[Message 83] David: Great! I'm excited to try something new.
[Message 84] Emily: This is going to be so much fun!
[Message 85] Alex: Fun? Yoga? We'll see about that.
[Message 86] Sarah: Have faith, Alex! You might actually enjoy it.
[Message 87] David: He will! We'll convert him.
[Message 88] Emily: Resistance is futile!
[Message 89] Alex: You guys are relentless.
[Message 90] Sarah: Only because we care!
[Message 91] David: And because we want to see you in stretchy pants.
[Message 92] Emily: Haha! That's a good point, David.
[Message 93] Alex: Stretchy pants? Now you're just pushing it.
[Message 94] Sarah: Come on, Alex! Embrace the stretchy pants!
[Message 95] David: They're surprisingly comfortable.
[Message 96] Emily: Like wearing a hug!
[Message 97] Alex: A hug? From pants? I'm not sure about this.
[Message 98] Sarah: Just try it! You might be surprised.
[Message 99] David: You have nothing to lose!
[Message 100] Emily: Except maybe some stress.
[Message 101] Alex: Okay, okay, I'll think about the stretchy pants.
[Message 102] Sarah: That's all we ask!
[Message 103] David: Progress!
[Message 104] Emily: We're wearing him down.
[Message 105] Alex: I'm starting to think this DMV trip was worth it just for the entertainment.
[Message 106] Sarah: See? Silver linings!
[Message 107] David: Always look on the bright side!
[Message 108] Emily: Even when you're stuck at the DMV at midnight.
[Message 109] Alex: You guys are good for my morale.
[Message 110] Sarah: That's what friends are for!
[Message 111] David: We're all in this together!
[Message 112] Emily: Solidarity!
[Message 113] Alex: Solidarity in suffering.
[Message 114] Sarah: Hey, we're almost through!
[Message 115] David: I see the light at the end of the tunnel!
[Message 116] Emily: Almost time for coney dogs!
[Message 117] Alex: I can practically taste the chili already.
[Message 118] Sarah: I'm so ready for some comfort food.
[Message 119] David: This whole experience has made me appreciate the simple things in life.
[Message 120] Emily: Like a good coney dog.
[Message 121] Alex: And good company.
[Message 122] Sarah: Absolutely!
[Message 123] David: To good company and coney dogs!
[Message 124] Emily: Cheers to that!
[Message 125] Alex: So, after the DMV, Lafayette, then what?
[Message 126] Sarah: Home to bed! It's late.
[Message 127] David: Agreed. Need to recharge for the park tomorrow.
[Message 128] Emily: Same. Gotta rest my vocal cords for the open mic night.
[Message 129] Alex: Smart. I'll probably just crash on the couch and watch some mindless TV.
[Message 130] Sarah: Sounds like a good plan. Relaxation is key.
[Message 131] David: Definitely. Don't forget those robotics club ideas, Alex!
[Message 132] Emily: And maybe those stretchy pants.
[Message 133] Alex: Alright, alright, you guys are relentless.
[Message 134] Sarah: We just want the best for you!
[Message 135] David: And for your son.
[Message 136] Emily: And for your wardrobe.
[Message 137] Alex: Okay, okay, I get it.
[Message 138] Sarah: Good!
[Message 139] David: Now let's get out of this DMV!
[Message 140] Emily: I'm so ready.
[Message 141] Alex: Almost there... I think.
[Message 142] Sarah: Just a few more minutes.
[Message 143] David: We're almost free!
[Message 144] Emily: Freedom!
[Message 145] Alex: Freedom never tasted so much like chili.
[Message 146] Sarah: Haha! You're right.
[Message 147] David: So close...
[Message 148] Emily: I can see the exit!
[Message 149] Alex: Let's do this!
[Message 150] Sarah: Let's go!
[Message 151] David: Time for coney dogs!
[Message 152] Emily: And freedom!
[Message 153] Alex: I’m starving!
[Message 154] Sarah: We all are!
[Message 155] David: Lafayette, here we come!
[Message 156] Emily: Finally!
[Message 157] Alex: Okay, I think I’m next!
[Message 158] Sarah: You got this, Alex!
[Message 159] David: Almost there!
[Message 160] Emily: You’re so close!
[Message 161] Alex: Thanks, guys! Feeling the support.
[Message 162] Sarah: We’re here for you!
[Message 163] David: Just breathe!
[Message 164] Emily: And think about coney dogs!
[Message 165] Alex: Coney dogs, coney dogs...
[Message 166] Sarah: It's working!
[Message 167] David: Keep focusing!
[Message 168] Emily: You're doing great!
[Message 169] Alex: Alright, I’m up! Wish me luck!
[Message 170] Sarah: Good luck, Alex!
[Message 171] David: You got this!
[Message 172] Emily: We're rooting for you!
[Message 173] Alex: Thanks, team!
[Message 174] Sarah: Now go get those papers!
[Message 175] David: And then, coney dogs!
[Message 176] Emily: Don't forget to smile!
[Message 177] Alex: Smiling! Wish me luck!
[Message 178] Sarah: You got it!
[Message 179] David: We’ll be waiting!

26,"[Message 1] Greta: Hey Liam, you still up for Small Hours tonight? Thinking of trying out that new board game place, Stairwell.
[Message 2] Liam: Hey Greta! Absolutely. Stairwell, huh? Never heard of it. Where is that exactly?
[Message 3] Greta: I think it's near that new cafe, ""Bean There, Done That"". Know where that is?
[Message 4] Liam: Hmm, vaguely. Is that near the library?
[Message 5] Greta: No, other direction. More towards the farmer's market.
[Message 6] Liam: Ah, okay. Farmer's market. Got it. What kind of games do they have?
[Message 7] Greta: Heard they have a good selection of co-op games, which I'm in the mood for. And some classics, of course.
[Message 8] Liam: Co-op, nice! I’m always down for a good co-op. Keeps things friendly.
[Message 9] Greta: Exactly! No need for unnecessary competition after a long week.
[Message 10] Liam: So true! What time are we aiming for?
[Message 11] Greta: How's 7:30? Gives us time to grab a coffee beforehand maybe?
[Message 12] Liam: 7:30 sounds perfect. Coffee beforehand is a great idea. My treat!
[Message 13] Greta: You're on! Okay, so Stairwell at 7:30. See you then!
[Message 14] Liam: Looking forward to it. Later, Greta!
[Message 15] Greta: Later, Liam!
[Message 16] Liam: Okay, just looked up Stairwell. It's further than I thought. Near that antique shop, right?
[Message 17] Greta: Oh yeah, that’s right! The one with all the…interesting… porcelain dolls?
[Message 18] Liam: Precisely. Makes it easier to find, actually.
[Message 19] Greta: Good! So no excuses for being late! ;)
[Message 20] Liam: Haha, no worries. Planning to leave work early anyway. Need some serious game time.
[Message 21] Greta: I hear you. This week has been… a week.
[Message 22] Liam: Tell me about it. Clients were especially demanding today.
[Message 23] Greta: Physical therapy is no joke, I swear. People think it’s just stretching!
[Message 24] Liam: Pharmacists have their own challenges, trust me. Misunderstandings about medications are a daily occurrence.
[Message 25] Greta: Ugh, I can imagine. Anyway, back to the important stuff: games! Any particular type you're hoping they have?
[Message 26] Liam: I'm always up for a good strategy game. Something with resource management maybe?
[Message 27] Greta: Ooh, those can be fun, but sometimes they can be a bit…dense.
[Message 28] Liam: True. But hey, keeps the brain sharp, right?
[Message 29] Greta: Haha, I suppose. I'm more of a narrative-driven game kinda gal. Something with a good story.
[Message 30] Liam: I can get behind that. A good story can make or break a game.
[Message 31] Greta: Exactly! Oh, speaking of stories, did you see that new documentary on…
[Message 32] Liam: Hold that thought! My phone's about to die. I'll text you later if anything changes with the Stairwell plan.
[Message 33] Greta: Gotcha. See you tonight!
[Message 34] Liam: Talk soon!
[Message 35] Greta: Hey Liam, quick question - what are you planning on wearing tonight? I'm trying to decide if I should dress up a bit or just go casual.
[Message 36] Liam: Oh, good question! I hadn’t even thought about it. I was just going to wear jeans and a t-shirt.
[Message 37] Greta: Okay, casual it is then! I'll stick with jeans too.
[Message 38] Liam: Perfect! Saves me from having to iron anything.
[Message 39] Greta: Haha, right? Ironing is the worst.
[Message 40] Liam: Agreed. So, games, coffee, and casual attire. Sounds like a plan.
[Message 41] Greta: Sounds perfect! Okay, gotta run. See you at Stairwell!
[Message 42] Liam: Later, Greta!
[Message 43] Liam: Okay, running a bit late. Traffic is a nightmare! Probably be there around 7:45.
[Message 44] Greta: No worries, I just got here myself. Place is pretty empty so far.
[Message 45] Liam: Good to know. Save me a seat!
[Message 46] Greta: Already on it! Right by the window.
[Message 47] Liam: Awesome! See you soon.
[Message 48] Greta: Can't wait!
[Message 49] Liam: Almost there! Spotted the antique shop.
[Message 50] Greta: Excellent! You're practically here.
[Message 51] Liam: Parking's a bit tricky. Any good spots you saw?
[Message 52] Greta: There's a spot down the block, near the bakery. Worth a shot.
[Message 53] Liam: Perfect. Thanks!
[Message 54] Greta: No problem! Hurry up, I'm getting bored! ;)
[Message 55] Liam: On it! Just parallel parked like a pro.
[Message 56] Greta: Impressive! See you inside.
[Message 57] Liam: Be right there!
[Message 58] Greta: Hey, Liam, I was just looking at the menu. They have some interesting snacks!
[Message 59] Liam: Oh really? What are you eyeing?
[Message 60] Greta: They have these artisanal pretzels with a beer cheese dip. Sounds amazing.
[Message 61] Liam: Ooh, that does sound good! I'm in.
[Message 62] Greta: Excellent! We'll have to try them.
[Message 63] Liam: Definitely. I'm starving.
[Message 64] Greta: Me too! All this game talk is making me hungry.
[Message 65] Liam: Should we grab a menu when I get there?
[Message 66] Greta: Sure thing! I'll flag one down.
[Message 67] Liam: Great! See you in a sec.
[Message 68] Greta: Looking forward to it! And the pretzels!
[Message 69] Liam: Pretzels are a priority!

27,"[Message 1] Leo: Good morning, everyone! Ready for another week? Found a spot at the food court.
[Message 2] Maya: Morning, Leo! I'm dragging myself, to be honest. Coffee is mandatory.
[Message 3] Alex: Morning! Yep, need caffeine IV drip STAT. What's everyone working on this week?
[Message 4] Sam: Morning all. Lots of reports due. Joy.
[Message 5] Leo: Maya, same here! Alex, I've got a huge catering event this weekend. So prepping like crazy.
[Message 6] Maya: Oh wow, Leo, what kind of event?
[Message 7] Alex: Big event, huh? Sounds stressful but fun. I'm debugging some legacy code... the fun never ends.
[Message 8] Sam: Legacy code... the bane of every programmer's existence.
[Message 9] Leo: It's a wedding, Maya! A massive one. Alex, I feel your pain. Debugging is soul-crushing.
[Message 10] Maya: A wedding! That sounds amazing, Leo. What's the menu?
[Message 11] Alex: Tell me about it, Sam. Leo, what's the theme for the wedding? Any fun dishes?
[Message 12] Sam: At least debugging is quiet. My patient schedule is packed this week. Back-to-back appointments.
[Message 13] Leo: Mediterranean theme, Alex. Lots of hummus, grilled meats, salads. And a HUGE dessert table.
[Message 14] Maya: Mediterranean sounds delicious! And Sam, I admire your patience.
[Message 15] Alex: Mediterranean? Sounds fantastic, Leo! I love that kind of food. Sam, I can't imagine the physical toll of your job.
[Message 16] Sam: It's rewarding, but yeah, my back definitely feels it. Invested in a good massage chair.
[Message 17] Leo: A good massage chair is crucial! I need to look into that.
[Message 18] Maya: Ooh, a massage chair sounds divine. Maybe I should get one too.
[Message 19] Alex: Highly recommend it. Especially if you're on your feet all day, Leo.
[Message 20] Sam: Costco has some good ones sometimes. Keep an eye out.
[Message 21] Leo: Thanks for the tip, Sam! I will. Maybe a team purchase for the kitchen is in order.
[Message 22] Maya: That's a great idea, Leo! Morale booster.
[Message 23] Alex: Definitely a morale booster. Beats a pizza party any day.
[Message 24] Sam: Agreed! Pizza is nice, but lasting comfort is better.
[Message 25] Leo: Exactly! Okay, back to the wedding. The bride wants a chocolate fountain...
[Message 26] Maya: Chocolate fountain! Classic.
[Message 27] Alex: Chocolate fountain! Are those still a thing? Nostalgia overload.
[Message 28] Sam: I haven't seen one of those in ages. Takes me back.
[Message 29] Leo: Apparently, they're making a comeback! I had to dust off my fountain skills.
[Message 30] Maya: Everything old is new again.
[Message 31] Alex: True. Fashion is cyclical, so why not chocolate fountains? Speaking of, I saw the coolest jacket yesterday...
[Message 32] Sam: Ooh, tell me about the jacket, Alex! I'm always on the lookout for something new.
[Message 33] Leo: Haha, nice segue, Alex! Okay, I'm intrigued too.
[Message 34] Maya: Me too! Spill the details.
[Message 35] Alex: It was a vintage leather bomber, but with embroidered patches. So unique. Thinking about going back for it.
[Message 36] Sam: Embroidered patches! That sounds amazing. Do it!
[Message 37] Leo: Go for it, Alex! You deserve it.
[Message 38] Maya: Yes! Treat yourself.
[Message 39] Alex: You guys are enabling me. I love it. Okay, I'll probably go back tomorrow.
[Message 40] Sam: Excellent! Let us know if you get it.
[Message 41] Leo: Yes, pictures are required!
[Message 42] Maya: Definitely pictures!
[Message 43] Alex: Deal! Okay, back to work for me. Legacy code isn't going to debug itself.
[Message 44] Sam: Good luck with that, Alex! I'm off to face the patients.
[Message 45] Leo: Good luck to you too, Sam! Maya, you surviving?
[Message 46] Maya: Barely, Leo. Barely. But I have coffee.
[Message 47] Leo: That's all that matters, right?
[Message 48] Maya: Pretty much. Okay, gotta run. See you guys later!
[Message 49] Alex: Bye Maya! Good luck!
[Message 50] Sam: Later Maya!
[Message 51] Leo: Bye Maya! Have a good day!
[Message 52] Alex: Anyone have any good TV show recommendations? Need something to binge.
[Message 53] Sam: ""The Great British Baking Show"" is always a good comfort watch.
[Message 54] Leo: I second that, Sam! So relaxing.
[Message 55] Alex: Ooh, I've heard good things. Might give it a try. Anything else?
[Message 56] Sam: If you like sci-fi, ""Severance"" on Apple TV is really good.
[Message 57] Leo: ""Severance"" is AMAZING. But it's not exactly relaxing...
[Message 58] Alex: Okay, noted. Maybe something lighter then.
[Message 59] Sam: What about ""Parks and Recreation""? Classic sitcom.
[Message 60] Leo: Can't go wrong with ""Parks and Rec""!
[Message 61] Alex: Okay, adding it to the list! Thanks, guys.
[Message 62] Sam: No problem! Always happy to share TV recommendations.
[Message 63] Leo: Same here! Now, back to thinking about that dessert table...
[Message 64] Alex: Tempting! Gotta stay focused though.
[Message 65] Sam: Tell me about it. These reports won't write themselves.
[Message 66] Leo: True, true. Okay, I'm off to the kitchen. Have a productive day, everyone!
[Message 67] Alex: You too, Leo!
[Message 68] Sam: Have a good one, Leo!
[Message 69] Alex: Anyone else feeling this weird early morning mall vibe?
[Message 70] Sam: It's definitely a unique atmosphere. Kind of surreal.
[Message 71] Alex: Right? Like a liminal space or something.
[Message 72] Sam: Exactly! The lighting is always so… interesting.
[Message 73] Alex: And the Muzak. Don't forget the Muzak.
[Message 74] Sam: How could I? It's permanently etched in my brain.
[Message 75] Alex: It's like a soundtrack to a very specific kind of existential dread.
[Message 76] Sam: You're not wrong. But hey, at least the coffee's good.
[Message 77] Alex: True. Coffee is the anchor in this sea of existential dread.
[Message 78] Sam: Precisely. Speaking of which, need a refill.
[Message 79] Alex: Same here. Be right back.
[Message 80] Alex: (Returns) Okay, refueled and ready to face the Muzak.
[Message 81] Sam: Good. Let's power through this.
[Message 82] Alex: Agreed. So, back to work…ugh.
[Message 83] Sam: Ugh is right. One hour at a time.
[Message 84] Alex: I'm setting a timer.
[Message 85] Sam: Smart. I might do the same.
[Message 86] Alex: This day is dragging already!
[Message 87] Sam: I know, right? Feels like it should be Friday.
[Message 88] Alex: Definitely feels like a Friday. Wishful thinking, I guess.
[Message 89] Sam: Just gotta keep telling myself it's almost the weekend.
[Message 90] Alex: Mantra for the day: ""It's almost the weekend.""
[Message 91] Sam: I'm writing that on a sticky note.
[Message 92] Alex: Good idea. I might print it out in giant letters.
[Message 93] Sam: Whatever works!
[Message 94] Alex: Right? Okay, back to the code. Wish me luck.
[Message 95] Sam: Good luck! You got this.
[Message 96] Alex: Thanks! I appreciate the encouragement.
[Message 97] Sam: Anytime! We all need a little boost sometimes.
[Message 98] Alex: Absolutely. Especially on Mondays.
[Message 99] Sam: Especially on Mondays. The universal struggle.
[Message 100] Alex: Exactly. Well, gotta dive back in.
[Message 101] Sam: Same here. Have a good one!
[Message 102] Alex: You too!
[Message 103] Sam: Just finished another report. One step closer to freedom.
[Message 104] Alex: Congrats! Every little victory counts.
[Message 105] Sam: Exactly! How's the code coming?
[Message 106] Alex: Slowly but surely. Found a particularly nasty bug.
[Message 107] Sam: Oh no! Those are the worst.
[Message 108] Alex: Tell me about it. Trying to stay calm and methodical.
[Message 109] Sam: That's the key. Deep breaths.
[Message 110] Alex: Deep breaths and lots of coffee.
[Message 111] Sam: Essential supplies.
[Message 112] Alex: Absolutely. Okay, gonna try another approach.
[Message 113] Sam: You got this!
[Message 114] Alex: Thanks! Appreciate it.
[Message 115] Sam: Seriously, let me know if you want to vent.
[Message 116] Alex: I might take you up on that offer later.
[Message 117] Sam: Anytime. I'm a good listener.
[Message 118] Alex: That's good to know. Thanks, Sam.
[Message 119] Sam: Of course. We all gotta support each other.

[Message 121] Sam: So true!
[Message 122] Alex: Well, back to the bug hunt.
[Message 123] Sam: Good luck! I'm going to try to tackle another report.
[Message 124] Alex: You too! Let's conquer these Mondays together.
[Message 125] Sam: Agreed! Onward and upward!
[Message 126] Alex: To victory! Or at least, to making it to lunchtime.
[Message 127] Sam: That's a victory in itself.
[Message 128] Alex: Absolutely. Okay, signing off for a bit.
[Message 129] Sam: Same here. Talk to you later!

[Message 134] Alex: Not sure yet. Maybe some noodles?
[Message 135] Sam: Ooh, that sounds good. I'm craving something savory.
[Message 136] Alex: Same here. Maybe the Thai place?

[Message 22] David: ""According to the reviews, they have different spice levels. So, something for everyone.""
[Message 23] Sarah: ""Perfect! Let's go to Bayou Bites then.""

[Message 48] Ashley: ""Speaking of relaxing, has anyone been to that new spa downtown?""
[Message 49] David: ""Heard good things about it. A little pricey, though.""
[Message 50] Sarah: ""Maybe for a special occasion.""
[Message 51] Michael: ""Okay, okay, enough with the diversions, are we moving to lunch or what?""
[Message 52] Emily: ""Alright, alright! Let's get going. Bayou Bites awaits!""
[Message 53] Ashley: ""I'm ready to eat until I can't move.""
[Message 54] David: ""Hopefully they have sweet tea.""

[Message 60] Sarah: ""Definitely! We should do this again soon.""
[Message 61] Michael: ""Agreed. But next time, someone else picks the restaurant.""
[Message 62] Emily: ""Haha! Deal.""
[Message 63] Ashley: ""So, are we all in the same car, or are we taking separate cars?""
[Message 64] David: ""Let's all pile into mine. It's the biggest.""
[Message 65] Sarah: ""Sounds good to me!""

[Message 5] Riley: School? What were they doing there so late?

[Message 6] Jordan: That’s what I’m saying. Super weird. I saw Mateo leave the building at Late Evening, He looked so nervous.

[Message 8] Riley: Mateo is always nervous. Doesn't mean anything.

[Message 11] Mateo: Hey Riley, you seen my phone charger?

[Message 12] Riley: Nope. Check under the couch?

[Message 19] Kai: Yeah, what's up? Can't sleep. This Judge Thompson thing is messing with my head.

[Message 20] Jordan: Tell me about it. I keep thinking about Mateo leaving the building.

[Message 21] Kai: I know. But Mateo is harmless. Right?

[Message 22] Jordan: I thought so... Did you know Thompson and Anika had beef?

[Message 23] Kai: Anika? No way! About what?

[Message 24] Jordan: Some business deal gone sour. I overheard them arguing last week. She said she wanted to get rid of him, but never I thought she would have done it.

[Message 25] Kai: Wow. This is getting complicated. We need to talk in person. Coffee tomorrow?

[Message 26] Jordan: Definitely. 10 am? Java Up?

[Message 35] Riley: Your ice pick? What do you need an ice pick for?

[Message 36] Mateo: Whittling! I told you. It was my grandpa’s. Super sentimental. I left it on the kitchen counter.

[Message 37] Riley: Oh. Right. I'll help you look when I get home.

[Message 38] Jordan: Kai, meet me at the usual spot instead. Changed my mind.

[Message 40] Jordan: Yup. See you there. This is important.

[Message 44] Jordan: I know! I didn’t think much of it at the time, but now…

[Message 45] Kai: This points towards Anika as the culprit. But Mateo losing his is…weird.

[Message 46] Jordan: Maybe they worked together? That’s something we should consider too.

[Message 47] Kai: I agree. This is getting serious.

[Message 48] Anika: Hey Riley, wanted to apologize again for the shift thing. Something really important came up.

[Message 49] Riley: It's okay, Anika. Really. No worries.

[Message 50] Anika: I know it's last minute. I owe you big time.

[Message 53] Riley: Still looking. No sign of it yet. Did you check your bag?

[Message 54] Mateo: Everywhere! It’s gone. I’m freaking out. It's like it vanished.

[Message 55] Riley: Calm down. It'll turn up. Maybe you just misplaced it.

[Message 56] Mateo: I hope so. I really do. I left it on the kitchen counter! I am so sure!

[Message 57] Jordan: Hey Kai, gotta run. PD just showed up at my door. They want to ask me about Thompson.

[Message 58] Kai: Woah! Seriously? Be careful what you say.

[Message 59] Jordan: I will. Wish me luck.

[Message 60] Kai: Good luck! Let me know what happens.

[Message 61] Riley: Mateo, found your ice pick! It was under the couch. You’re so absent-minded.

[Message 62] Mateo: OMG, you found it? Really? Thank God! You’re a lifesaver!

[Message 63] Riley: Told you it would turn up. Just be more careful next time.

[Message 64] Mateo: I will, I promise! Thanks again!

[Message 67] Anika: I intend to pay you back, big time. How about dinner next week? My treat.

[Message 68] Riley: Sounds great!

[Message 69] Jordan: Well, that was…intense. PD asked me about Anika and Mateo. I didn't mention about Anika purchasing Stabbing with an ice pick.

[Message 70] Kai: What did you say? Did you mention seeing Mateo leaving School?

[Message 71] Jordan: I said I saw him leave. But I made it sound like it was earlier. Like I was uncertain of the time.

[Message 72] Kai: Smart. This whole thing is a mess. Hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 73] Anika: I saw that Thompson did not call 911 after I broke my leg. 

[Message 74] Mateo: Thank goodness that Riley found my Stabbing with an ice pick! I would have gotten arrested!

[Message 75] Anika: I do not regret hiring someone to murder Thompson, I hated him!

[Message 76] Jordan: They questioned me because they saw Mateo leave the building and Anika buying something at the store.

[Message 77] Anika: Can the authorities know who was involved in Thompson murder?

[Message 78] Kai: This is probably because Anika purposefully did not help when Thompson was injured.

[Message 79] Jordan: I had intended to make it sound like Mateo was earlier but i may be mistaken.

[Message 80] Riley: Hope they don't get arrested, they're going away for a long time for this",1,

[Message 2] Jamie: Morning, Alex! A little, yeah. But at least it's Friday. Anyone got weekend plans?
[Message 3] Sam: Morning! Just hoping to get some fishing in if the weather holds up. Meeting about what this time?
[Message 4] Chris: Morning, all. Probably another update on the new volunteering initiative. Sigh.
[Message 5] Jordan: Morning. Volunteering, huh? I'm kind of excited about it.
[Message 6] Alex: Fishing sounds amazing, Sam. This weather is so unpredictable though. Yeah, Chris, volunteering... It's okay, I guess.
[Message 7] Jamie: Volunteering could be fun! What kind of options are they presenting this time?
[Message 8] Sam: I heard they're partnering with the food bank.
[Message 9] Chris: Food bank, animal shelter, the usual suspects.
[Message 10] Jordan: Food bank sounds good to me. I've done that before, it's pretty rewarding.
[Message 11] Alex: I've always wanted to volunteer at the animal shelter. Just never had the time.
[Message 12] Jamie: I wonder if they need help with gaming events for kids. That would be right up my alley.
[Message 13] Sam: Jamie, that's a great idea!
[Message 14] Chris: That's actually a really innovative suggestion, Jamie.
[Message 15] Jordan: Seriously! Maybe you should suggest that at the meeting.
[Message 16] Alex: Definitely suggest it! They're always looking for new ideas. Speaking of, does anyone know if Mrs. Davison is retiring soon?
[Message 17] Jamie: I heard rumors. Retirement party potential?
[Message 18] Sam: She's been here a long time. Definitely deserves a good send-off.
[Message 19] Chris: Okay, back to volunteering before we get completely off track. I'm leaning towards the animal shelter.
[Message 20] Jordan: Animal shelters are always swamped. Good choice, Chris.
[Message 21] Alex: I still need to learn how to play the banjo. Maybe after this meeting.
[Message 22] Jamie: Banjo! Cool! I've always wanted to learn an instrument.
[Message 23] Sam: I tried guitar once. Didn't go so well.
[Message 24] Chris: I'm sticking with reading the news. Much less frustrating.
[Message 25] Jordan: Current events are a never-ending rollercoaster, Chris.
[Message 26] Alex: True that, Jordan. So, food bank, animal shelter, gaming events... good options.
[Message 27] Jamie: We should brainstorm more ideas for the meeting. Maybe some inter-departmental stuff?
[Message 28] Sam: Like what?
[Message 29] Chris: Cross-training opportunities?
[Message 30] Jordan: Or mentorship programs.
[Message 31] Alex: Mentorship programs are a great idea!
[Message 32] Jamie: Yes! Mentorship! I’m on board with that.
[Message 33] Sam: Could be good for new hires.
[Message 34] Chris: Helps with team building too, I think.
[Message 35] Jordan: Definitely increases morale.
[Message 36] Alex: Alright, team: food bank, animal shelter, gaming events, mentorship program... anything else before we head in?
[Message 37] Jamie: Nope, I think we've got a solid list.
[Message 38] Sam: Good to go.
[Message 39] Chris: Ready.
[Message 40] Jordan: Let's do this.
[Message 41] Alex: Let's get this over with.
[Message 42] Jamie: Lol, agreed. Anyone grab coffee before this?
[Message 43] Sam: I did. Strong stuff.
[Message 44] Chris: Lucky you. I'm running on fumes.
[Message 45] Jordan: I had tea this morning. Trying to be healthy.
[Message 46] Alex: I need to cut back on the coffee. My hands are shaking just thinking about this meeting.
[Message 47] Jamie: Maybe they'll have snacks.
[Message 48] Sam: Fingers crossed.
[Message 49] Chris: Always a motivator.
[Message 50] Jordan: Small joys.
[Message 51] Alex: True, true. Okay, well, see you all inside! Wish us luck!
[Message 52] Jamie: Good luck!
[Message 53] Sam: You too!
[Message 54] Chris: See you in there.
[Message 55] Jordan: Later.
[Message 56] Jamie: Alright, I'm heading into the office. Thinking of making a quick stop at the coffee shop!
[Message 57] Alex: Smart move Jamie. It’ll make that meeting a little better.
[Message 58] Sam: Let me know if they have good scones, I might come by later.
[Message 59] Chris: I agree, a good cup of coffee is a must before facing the day's challenges!
[Message 60] Jordan: Don't forget to try their new blend, Jamie!
[Message 61] Jamie: Will do, guys! I'm sure the coffee will help make the meeting bearable!
[Message 62] Alex: Just focus on the volunteering options and try to zone out when they talk about the budget.
[Message 63] Sam: Good strategy, Alex! I might borrow that.
[Message 64] Chris: I'll be taking notes, but zoning out is definitely tempting.
[Message 65] Jordan: I'm just hoping the meeting doesn't run overtime. I have a doctor's appointment this afternoon.
[Message 66] Jamie: Hoping that too! Always a pain if those meetings run over.
[Message 67] Alex: Yeah, they always take longer than expected.
[Message 68] Sam: True, and they always seem to cover the same ground.
[Message 69] Chris: It's like Groundhog Day, every time.
[Message 70] Jordan: Anyway, gotta run! Good luck with the meeting, everyone.
[Message 71] Alex: Thanks, Jordan! You too with the appointment!
[Message 72] Jamie: Good luck Jordan!
[Message 73] Sam: See ya Jordan!
[Message 74] Chris: Hope everything goes well, Jordan!
[Message 75] Jamie: Okay, gotta jet too! Coffee calls! Talk later!
[Message 76] Alex: Later Jamie!
[Message 77] Sam: Bye Jamie!
[Message 78] Chris: Have a good one Jamie!
[Message 79] Alex: Well, here we go. Meeting time. Wish me luck, Sam and Chris.

[Message 1] CHLOE: Did you hear about what happened at the Subway Station?
[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. What a mess.
[Message 3] CHLOE: I know, right? Security guard and some other dude. They said his name was Marcus.
[Message 4] AVA: Dayton is getting worse every day, I swear.
[Message 5] BEN: Tell me about it. Makes you wonder who's next.
[Message 6] LIAM: You guys going to Maria's party this weekend?
[Message 7] AVA: Probably. Need a distraction after this week.
[Message 8] BEN: I'm in. Need to forget about all this darkness.
[Message 9] CHLOE: I might skip it. Still shaken up.
[Message 10] LIAM: Suit yourself. More cake for us.
[Message 11] AVA: Did they say how they died?
[Message 12] BEN: Arson by setting a fire, apparently. Burned alive.
[Message 13] CHLOE: OMG! So terrible!
[Message 14] LIAM: Jesus. Harsh way to go.
[Message 15] AVA: I used to see that security guard all the time. Seemed like a quiet guy.
[Message 16] BEN: Maybe too quiet. You never know what people are hiding.
[Message 17] CHLOE: What do you mean?
[Message 18] BEN: Just saying, people aren't always who they seem.
[Message 19] LIAM: Deep thoughts, Ben.
[Message 20] AVA: Seriously. Anyway, who was the other guy?
[Message 21] CHLOE: Marcus, I think they said. Didn't know him.
[Message 22] BEN: Heard he was mixed up in some shady stuff.
[Message 23] LIAM: Like what?
[Message 24] BEN: Just rumors. Nothing concrete.
[Message 25] AVA: Still...makes you think.
[Message 26] CHLOE: Makes you think what?
[Message 27] AVA: Maybe he deserved it. I'm just saying.
[Message 28] LIAM: Whoa, Ava! That's cold.
[Message 29] BEN: Yeah, a little harsh.
[Message 30] AVA: Sorry, just saying, sometimes bad things happen to bad people.
[Message 31] CHLOE: Still doesn't make it okay.
[Message 32] LIAM: True. Alright, enough gloom. Maria's party – 8 PM, Saturday. Be there or be square.
[Message 33] BEN: Got it.
[Message 34] AVA: On it.
[Message 35] CHLOE: Okay, maybe I'll come after all. Need some cheering up.
[Message 36] LIAM: That's the spirit!
[Message 37] AVA: Did either of you guys know a Dakota?
[Message 38] BEN: Dakota? I don't think so.
[Message 39] LIAM: Nope. Why?
[Message 40] AVA: Just heard the police were asking around about someone named Dakota.
[Message 41] CHLOE: Maybe connected to the murders?
[Message 42] BEN: Could be.
[Message 43] LIAM: Damn, this is getting complicated.
[Message 44] AVA: I know, right?
[Message 45] CHLOE: So, what are we thinking for Maria's gift?
[Message 46] LIAM: Gift card?
[Message 47] BEN: Classic.
[Message 48] AVA: Boring. Let's get her something fun.
[Message 49] CHLOE: Like what?
[Message 50] AVA: I don't know! That's why I'm asking you guys!
[Message 51] LIAM: Relax, Ava. We'll figure it out.
[Message 52] BEN: Hey, Chloe, you okay? You've been quiet.
[Message 53] CHLOE: Just thinking. This whole thing is messed up.
[Message 54] LIAM: Yeah, it is.
[Message 55] AVA: We should all try to stick together, you know?
[Message 56] BEN: Definitely.
[Message 57] CHLOE: Agreed.
[Message 58] LIAM: So, gift ideas? Anyone?
[Message 59] AVA: Massage certificate?
[Message 60] BEN: Not bad.
[Message 61] CHLOE: I like it.
[Message 62] LIAM: Okay, massage certificate it is.
[Message 63] AVA: Cool.
[Message 64] BEN: I'll pick it up tomorrow.
[Message 65] CHLOE: Thanks, Ben.
[Message 66] LIAM: Appreciate it, man.
[Message 67] AVA: So, back to the murders... you think they'll catch who did it?
[Message 68] BEN: Hope so.
[Message 69] CHLOE: For sure.
[Message 70] LIAM: They have to.
[Message 71] AVA: I heard the Security Guard, his name was David, had some enemies.
[Message 72] BEN: Oh yeah? Who?
[Message 73] AVA: Just office gossip, you know? Someone he fired.
[Message 74] CHLOE: Could be a lead.
[Message 75] LIAM: The cops should check it out.
[Message 76] BEN: They probably are.
[Message 77] AVA: Remember that time Maria set her hair on Arson by setting a fire trying to light a birthday candle?
[Message 78] CHLOE: LOL! Oh my god, yes!
[Message 79] LIAM: I missed that!
[Message 80] BEN: Classic Maria.
[Message 81] AVA: She was so mad!
[Message 82] CHLOE: Good times.
[Message 83] LIAM: Okay, back to serious. Anyone need a ride to the party?
[Message 84] BEN: I'm good.
[Message 85] AVA: Me too.
[Message 86] CHLOE: I might need one.
[Message 87] LIAM: I'll pick you up, Chloe.
[Message 88] CHLOE: Thanks, Liam.
[Message 89] AVA: Speaking of fire...anyone know where I can get some good deals on candles?
[Message 90] BEN: Random.
[Message 91] LIAM: Amazon?
[Message 92] CHLOE: Bath & Body Works?
[Message 93] AVA: Good idea.
[Message 94] BEN: This conversation is all over the place.
[Message 95] LIAM: Tell me about it.
[Message 96] CHLOE: Welcome to our lives.
[Message 97] AVA: Haha!
[Message 98] BEN: I'm heading out. See you guys Saturday.
[Message 99] LIAM: Later, man.
[Message 100] CHLOE: Bye, Ben.
[Message 101] AVA: See ya.
[Message 102] LIAM: So, Chloe, you really shaken up?
[Message 103] CHLOE: Yeah, honestly. It's creeping me out.
[Message 104] AVA: Me too. I keep thinking about what could have happened if the fire spread.
[Message 105] LIAM: Don't go there.
[Message 106] CHLOE: Easier said than done.
[Message 107] AVA: Remember that guy, Marcus, that got fired last month? He always hated David. He literally told me ""I will get rid of him""
[Message 108] LIAM: Really? You should tell the cops that, Ava.
[Message 109] CHLOE: Definitely. That's important.
[Message 110] AVA: I will. Just... scared, you know?
[Message 111] LIAM: I get it. But you have to.
[Message 112] CHLOE: Ava is right, Liam.
[Message 113] AVA: Ugh, you're right.
[Message 114] LIAM: Good. Stay safe, you two.
[Message 115] CHLOE: You too, Liam.
[Message 116] AVA: Yeah. Later.
[Message 117] CHLOE: Did you ever talk to Dakota?
[Message 118] LIAM: Dakota? No why?
[Message 119] CHLOE: Someone told me they looking for Dakota to punish the ones that they feel caused the incident.
[Message 120] LIAM: Wow, this is getting out of control!
[Message 121] CHLOE: Yep.
[Message 122] AVA: Hey guys. Just gave my statement to the police.
[Message 123] BEN: Good for you.
[Message 124] CHLOE: Awesome.
[Message 125] LIAM: That's the right thing to do.
[Message 126] AVA: I feel a little better now.
[Message 127] BEN: What did they ask you?
[Message 128] AVA: Just about what I knew about Marcus and David.
[Message 129] CHLOE: Did you tell them about Marcus hating David?
[Message 130] AVA: Of course.
[Message 131] LIAM: Hopefully, that helps.
[Message 132] BEN: Anyway, who is bringing the drinks to Marias party?
[Message 133] CHLOE: Ill buy
[Message 134] AVA: Awesome!
[Message 135] LIAM: I can bring some snacks.
[Message 136] BEN: Ill bring my speaker.
[Message 137] CHLOE: Perfect! Its gonna be awesome!
[Message 138] AVA: Yes!
[Message 139] LIAM: Lets hope they dont get the death penalty!
[Message 140] BEN: Thats true
[Message 141] CHLOE: So scary!
[Message 142] AVA: Maybe it was for self-defense.
[Message 143] BEN: You never know
[Message 144] LIAM: Guys! Stop with that talk!
[Message 145] CHLOE: Sorry.
[Message 146] AVA: Sorry.
[Message 147] BEN: Did you ever see Dakota buying arson by setting a fire at the store, Ava?
[Message 148] CHLOE: Why do you ask?
[Message 149] LIAM: Weird question man.
[Message 150] AVA: I have never seen Dakota ever.
[Message 151] BEN: Just thought you did since you saw him mad.
[Message 152] CHLOE: That is a red flag.
[Message 153] LIAM: What?
[Message 154] AVA: What did you see Ben?
[Message 155] BEN: Nothin!
[Message 156] CHLOE: Youre sus!
[Message 157] LIAM: Tell us Ben

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. Who were they?

[Message 3] Maya: I heard it was Chris and Jamie. Jamie was the taxi driver, right?

[Message 4] Liam: Chris? The drug dealer? Wow. What a mess.

[Message 5] Sarah: This is terrible! I can't believe it. I used to see Jamie driving all the time.

[Message 6] Maya: I know, right? So messed up.

[Message 7] Liam: Any idea what happened?

[Message 8] Maya: Rumor is stabbing with an ice pick. Awful.

[Message 9] Sarah: Oh god, that's horrific.

[Message 10] Liam: Police probably think it was some drug deal gone wrong with Chris, right?

[Message 11] Maya: Makes sense. But still...Jamie?

[Message 12] Sarah: I can't imagine Jamie being involved in anything like that. Always so optimistic.

[Message 13] Liam: Exactly. So random.

[Message 14] Maya: Hey Sarah, you live near School, right? Did you see anything weird Evening?

[Message 15] Sarah: Not really. I was watching TV. Why?

[Message 16] Maya: Just curious. The cops are probably asking everyone.

[Message 17] Liam: Yeah, they'll be thorough.

[Message 18] Sarah: True. I was at the store earlier though, and I saw Ava buying an ice pick. Thought it was weird, but…

[Message 19] Maya: Ava? Seriously?

[Message 20] Liam: Ava, the one with full lips? What would she need an ice pick for?

[Message 21] Sarah: I don't know! Maybe for ice sculptures? It was at the hardware store.

[Message 22] Maya: Ice sculptures in East St. Louis? Seems unlikely.

[Message 23] Liam: True lol.

[Message 24] Sarah: Okay, I'm just saying what I saw!

[Message 25] Maya: No worries, just seems sus.

[Message 26] Liam: Did you guys know Chris at all? I only saw him around.

[Message 27] Maya: Not really. Just knew he was… around.

[Message 28] Sarah: I knew Chris a little bit. Seemed like he was always trying to make a deal. Ambitious guy.

[Message 29] Liam: Yeah, that's the vibe I got.

[Message 30] Maya: I heard Ava and Chris didn't get along. Something about a secret?

[Message 31] Sarah: Oh really? I didn’t know that.

[Message 32] Liam: Ooh, juicy. What secret?

[Message 33] Maya: No idea. Just a rumor.

[Message 34] Sarah: Well, if it involved Chris, it was probably something shady.

[Message 35] Liam: Agreed.

[Message 36] Maya: This whole thing is just so messed up.

[Message 37] Sarah: I keep thinking about Jamie. He was so young.

[Message 38] Liam: Yeah, that's what gets me too.

[Message 39] Maya: Okay, I'm going to try to get some sleep. This is giving me nightmares.

[Message 40] Liam: Same. Night.

[Message 41] Sarah: Good night.

[Message 42] Liam: Hey Maya, you up?

[Message 43] Maya: Yeah, what's up?

[Message 44] Liam: I was just thinking about what you said about Ava and Chris. Do you think she intended to hurt him?

[Message 45] Maya: I don't know, Liam. It's just a rumor. Don't start jumping to conclusions.

[Message 46] Liam: True. It's just... the ice pick thing...

[Message 47] Sarah: Guys, come on. Let’s not start pointing fingers.

[Message 48] Maya: Exactly, Sarah.

[Message 49] Liam: Right, right. Sorry. Just hard not to think about it.

[Message 50] Sarah: I understand.

[Message 51] Maya: Did either of you guys see Ava Evening?

[Message 52] Liam: No, I was at home all night.

[Message 53] Sarah: Same here.

[Message 54] Maya: Okay, just checking.

[Message 55] Liam: Why?

[Message 56] Maya: No reason. Just trying to piece things together.

[Message 57] Sarah: Well, let the police do their job, Maya.

[Message 58] Maya: You're right.

[Message 59] Liam: This is crazy. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 60] Sarah: Me too. Justice for Chris and Jamie.

[Message 61] Maya: Agreed.

[Message 62] Liam: Hey, unrelated, but anyone know a good place to get a tire changed?

[Message 63] Maya: I do! I'll text you the info.

[Message 64] Sarah: You guys are changing the subject fast.

[Message 66] Sarah: I get it.

[Message 67] Maya: Yeah, sorry. It's just... a lot.

[Message 68] Liam: Agreed.

[Message 69] Maya: Okay, going to try to sleep again. Hopefully, this time it works.

[Message 71] Liam: Night.

[Message 72] Sarah: Hey Maya, you there?

[Message 73] Maya: Yeah, what's up now?

[Message 74] Sarah: Just had a weird thought. Remember how I said I saw Ava at the hardware store?

[Message 75] Maya: Yeah?

[Message 76] Sarah: I think... I think I saw her talking to Chris earlier that day. They looked like they were arguing.

[Message 77] Maya: Seriously? Why didn't you say anything earlier?

[Message 78] Sarah: I didn't think anything of it at the time! It was just a quick glimpse. But now…

[Message 79] Maya: Did it look heated? Like she wanted to get rid of him?

[Message 80] Sarah: I don't know. It was just… intense. He was looking down when she turned away.

[Message 81] Liam: Okay, this is getting serious.

[Message 82] Maya: Maybe you should tell the police, Sarah.

[Message 83] Sarah: I know, I know. I'm just… scared.

[Message 2] Maya: ""Yeah, it's all over the news. Awful. Two people dead? ""
[Message 3] Liam: ""Crazy, right? They said it was near closing time. I saw Ben walking around there earlier that night. Thought he was going to see a movie.""
[Message 4] Maya: ""Ben? Really? What movie was he seeing?""
[Message 5] Liam: ""I don't know; I didn't ask. We just said hi. Actually, he looked kinda stressed. Muttered something about needing to 'get something sorted'. I think he always hated 3.  Taxi Driver (Victim 1) though.""
[Message 6] Maya: ""Hmm, weird. Anyway, I had a weird day. I saw Chloe buying Asphyxiation by strangulation at the store, I thought it was strange.""
[Message 7] Liam: ""Asphyxiation by strangulation? Who buys that at the store? Maybe she was planning a party?""
[Message 8] Maya: ""A party, yeah right. Anyways, I cant stand it when people are late. Are we still on for dinner tomorrow?""
[Message 9] Liam: ""Yup, still on. Don't worry, I'll be on time. Unlike some people I know *cough* Mark *cough*""

[Message 11] Liam: ""No way, Sarah? The Judge? That's messed up. I saw David arguing with someone near the theater like a week ago. It could have been her.""
[Message 12] Maya: ""David? That short guy with short eyelashes? What were they arguing about?""
[Message 13] Liam: ""Sounded like money. Loudly. Maybe that Taxi Driver, John, was involved too, he was always in debt. They are going away for a long time for this.""

[Message 20] Maya: ""Pretty sure. Why?""
[Message 21] Liam: ""No reason. Just seemed odd. Ben also had a bunch of Asphyxiation by strangulation when I saw him last week.""
[Message 22] Maya: ""Huh. Well, Ben always was a bit strange. I am sure he intended to sort something out. I am sure the police will figure it out. You know, David was fired from the theater last month. I remember him saying he wanted to get rid of him.""
[Message 23] Liam: ""Fired? By who? Sarah? Wow. Maybe his shouting probably provoked him.""
[Message 24] Maya: ""I think so. Something about stealing. Anyway, what do you think about the new Star Wars trailer?""
[Message 25] Liam: ""Looks amazing! Can't wait. By the way, did you hear that Ben's alibi checked out?""
[Message 26] Maya: ""No, I didn't. How convenient for him. This is starting to get complicated.""
[Message 27] Liam: ""Tell me about it. Hey, do you think David could have had an accomplice?""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Maybe. It wouldn't surprise me. He always seemed like the type to need help. He was looking up how to make Asphyxiation by strangulation online. It was weird. She tried to talk him out of it.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""That's messed up. Well, I'm sure they'll catch whoever did it.""
[Message 30] Maya: ""Me too. Anyway, gotta go. Talk tomorrow!""
[Message 31] Liam: ""Later. One last thing. David was near Sarah, but Chloe was working a double that night.""
[Message 32] Maya: ""Hmm, Chloe's Asphyxiation by strangulation purchase is looking suspicious again. I saw Ben leave the building at Night.""

[Message 2] Jordan: Stunning sunset, Alex! Just finished my shift, grabbing some air.
[Message 3] Casey: Same here, Jordan! Needed to escape the office. How's everyone doing?
[Message 4] Riley: Doing well, Casey! Just thinking about taking some online courses. Any recommendations?
[Message 5] Sam: Online courses? What are you looking to study, Riley?
[Message 6] Riley: I was thinking something in data analysis, Sam. Always been curious.
[Message 7] Alex: Data analysis is a great field, Riley! I'm a data analyst myself.
[Message 8] Jordan: Oh wow, really Alex? I’ve always wondered what that entails.
[Message 9] Alex: It's a lot of looking for patterns and insights in data, Jordan. Very rewarding!
[Message 10] Casey: Sounds interesting! I'm in project management, which also requires analyzing data, just in a different way.
[Message 11] Riley: Exactly, Casey! That's why I thought it might complement my skillset.
[Message 12] Sam: You should check out Coursera or edX, Riley. They have tons of data analysis courses.
[Message 13] Riley: Thanks, Sam! I'll definitely check those out. Any specific courses you'd recommend?
[Message 14] Alex: I'd suggest looking for courses that focus on SQL or Python, Riley. Those are very useful.
[Message 15] Jordan: Python? Isn't that a type of snake?
[Message 16] Casey: (laughs) It's also a programming language, Jordan!
[Message 17] Jordan: Oh! Makes much more sense. Shows how much I know about tech!
[Message 18] Sam: No worries, Jordan! Everyone has their areas of expertise.
[Message 19] Riley: So, SQL or Python... noted, Alex! Thanks for the advice.
[Message 20] Alex: No problem, Riley! Happy to help.
[Message 21] Casey: Speaking of learning new things, I'm trying to learn Spanish. It's tough!
[Message 22] Sam: I tried learning Spanish once, Casey. Duolingo is pretty good.
[Message 23] Casey: I've heard that! I'll give it a shot.
[Message 24] Riley: Languages are so cool! I wish I had the time.
[Message 25] Jordan: Agreed! I’m trying to learn basic electrical codes. It’s like learning a new language.
[Message 26] Alex: Haha, I can imagine, Jordan!
[Message 27] Sam: So, Riley, any other subjects you’re considering besides data analysis?
[Message 28] Riley: Not really, Sam. I'm pretty focused on that for now. Maybe some graphic design later.
[Message 29] Casey: Graphic design would be fun!
[Message 30] Alex: It would definitely complement data analysis well, Riley! Visualizing data is important.
[Message 31] Jordan: I agree, Alex. A good visual can make all the difference.
[Message 32] Sam: Have you guys ever had to give feedback to a colleague? That's always a tricky situation.
[Message 33] Casey: Oh man, definitely, Sam! I have to do that all the time as a project manager.
[Message 34] Riley: Yeah, it's tough to be honest but also constructive.
[Message 35] Alex: Honesty is key, but always frame it positively and offer solutions.
[Message 36] Jordan: Good point, Alex! Focus on improvement, not just pointing out flaws.
[Message 37] Casey: Exactly! And be specific. Don't just say ""you need to improve your communication skills.""
[Message 38] Sam: Right, give examples of what they can do differently.
[Message 39] Riley: This is really helpful advice. I might have to use this soon.
[Message 40] Alex: Good luck, Riley!
[Message 41] Jordan: Maybe offer to help them, too. Like, ""I can show you how I approach this problem.""
[Message 42] Casey: That's a great idea, Jordan! Mentorship can be really effective.
[Message 43] Sam: True, offering support can make a big difference.
[Message 44] Riley: I'll keep all of that in mind. Thanks, everyone!
[Message 45] Alex: No problem, Riley! We've all been there.
[Message 46] Jordan: Changing the subject slightly, anyone seen any good movies lately?
[Message 47] Casey: I saw that new sci-fi flick. It was pretty good!
[Message 48] Sam: Oh yeah? What was it called?
[Message 49] Casey: ""Stellaris"". Lots of cool visuals.
[Message 50] Riley: I'll add it to my list!
[Message 51] Alex: I’m more into documentaries these days.
[Message 52] Jordan: Any recommendations for documentaries, Alex?
[Message 53] Alex: ""My Octopus Teacher"" on Netflix is amazing.
[Message 54] Jordan: An octopus teacher? That sounds wild!
[Message 55] Casey: I've heard of that one! I need to watch it.
[Message 56] Sam: Me too! I love nature documentaries.
[Message 57] Riley: Okay, adding that one to the list as well.
[Message 58] Alex: You won't regret it!
[Message 59] Jordan: Back to education, anyone ever consider going back to school for something completely different?
[Message 60] Casey: I’ve thought about getting a degree in psychology.
[Message 61] Sam: That’s interesting, Casey. Why psychology?
[Message 62] Casey: I've always been fascinated by the human mind.
[Message 63] Riley: It's never too late to learn something new!
[Message 64] Alex: Exactly! Lifelong learning is the key.
[Message 65] Jordan: True! Especially with how fast things are changing in every field.
[Message 66] Sam: Yeah, you have to keep up with the latest trends.
[Message 67] Riley: What about you, Sam? Any educational goals?
[Message 68] Sam: I'd like to learn more about AI, actually.
[Message 69] Casey: AI is the future!
[Message 70] Alex: It's already the present, Sam! Definitely a good area to focus on.
[Message 71] Jordan: What kind of AI stuff are you interested in?
[Message 72] Sam: Machine learning, mostly.
[Message 73] Riley: That sounds complicated!
[Message 74] Alex: It can be, but there are lots of resources available online.
[Message 75] Jordan: I guess everything is learnable if you put your mind to it.
[Message 76] Casey: Agreed!
[Message 77] Sam: Exactly! Okay, I think I'm going to head home. It's getting late.
[Message 78] Riley: Me too. Thanks for the chat, everyone!
[Message 79] Alex: You too, Riley! Have a good night.
[Message 80] Jordan: Night all! It was great catching up.
[Message 81] Casey: Good night, everyone! Drive safe.
[Message 82] Sam: Will do, Casey! See you all soon.

[Message 8] Maria: ""David, who is 'He'?!""
[Message 9] David: ""Just saying it's a mess. Someone died.""
[Message 10] Maria: ""That's all you have to say? Someone young. Someone with a life.""
[Message 11] David: ""What do you want me to say, Maria? I barely knew her.""
[Message 12] Maria: ""I don't know, some basic human decency would be a start.""
[Message 13] Ben: ""Guys, let's not fight. This is terrible news. Poor Sarah. She didn't deserve this. I saw David leave the building at Mid-Morning now that I think about it""

[Message 15] David: ""I had a meeting! What's that supposed to mean?""

[Message 17] David: ""None of your business. I'm not a suspect. I’m covering up another crime, remember?""
[Message 18] Maria: ""That sounds suspicious, David.""
[Message 19] Ben: ""Yeah, a little sus, Dave. Just saying.""
[Message 20] Liam: ""Alright, alright. Let's not jump to conclusions. Let the police do their job.""
[Message 21] Chloe: ""Easy for you to say, Liam. You weren't close to her.""
[Message 22] Liam: ""That's not fair, Chloe.""
[Message 23] Ben: ""Anyone know how it happened? They saying?""
[Message 24] Liam: ""No official word yet. Just that it was sudden.""
[Message 25] Maria: ""He always hated Sarah. Remember? I always thought it was a bit much.""
[Message 26] David: ""That's a lie, Maria! I didn't 'hate' her. We just had disagreements.""
[Message 27] Chloe: ""Disagreements that involved you yelling at her in front of customers, David.""
[Message 28] David: ""Okay, maybe I raised my voice sometimes. It was never intended to cause harm.""
[Message 29] Ben: ""Just saying...not a good look, dude.""
[Message 30] Liam: ""Let's just try to stay calm and cooperate with the police. Okay?""
[Message 31] Chloe: ""Fine. But I want justice for Sarah.""
[Message 32] Maria: ""Me too. She was so young.""
[Message 33] Ben: ""Same here. This sucks.""
[Message 34] David: ""Of course, justice. What else would I want?""
[Message 35] Liam: ""Right. So, who's heard from the police yet?""
[Message 36] Chloe: ""I haven't.""
[Message 37] Maria: ""Nope.""
[Message 38] Ben: ""Not yet.""
[Message 39] David: ""They haven't contacted me either. I have a religious extremism.""
[Message 40] Liam: ""Okay. Well, just be ready, I guess.""
[Message 41] Chloe: ""This whole thing is so surreal. Like a bad dream.""
[Message 42] Maria: ""I keep expecting her to walk in any minute.""
[Message 43] Ben: ""Yeah...it's going to be weird not seeing her around.""
[Message 44] David: ""Life goes on, doesn't it?""
[Message 45] Maria: ""Wow, David. Really?""
[Message 46] Liam: ""David, maybe keep those thoughts to yourself right now.""
[Message 47] Chloe: ""Seriously. Have some respect.""

[Message 51] Chloe: ""I'm going to go lie down. I can't deal with this right now.""
[Message 52] Maria: ""I might do the same. Let's talk later.""
[Message 53] Ben: ""Yeah, hit me up if you need anything.""
[Message 54] David: ""Sure. Whatever.""
[Message 55] Liam: ""Alright. I'm going to try and get some work done. Talk soon.""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Okay. Bye.""
[Message 57] Maria: ""Bye.""
[Message 58] Ben: ""Later.""
[Message 59] David: ""Later.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Ugh, this training is so boring.""

[Message 63] Ben: ""Wasn't me! I use the red one.""
[Message 64] Liam: ""Guys, can we not with the office supplies drama right now?""
[Message 65] Chloe: ""Sorry, Liam. Just trying to lighten the mood.""
[Message 66] Maria: ""Yeah, sorry. Distraction tactic.""
[Message 67] Ben: ""No worries. Just stressed, I get it.""
[Message 68] David: ""Anyone know what's for lunch?""
[Message 69] Liam: ""Seriously, David?""
[Message 70] Chloe: ""Unbelievable.""
[Message 71] Maria: ""I am speechless.""
[Message 72] Ben: ""Dude, read the room!""
[Message 73] David: ""What? I'm hungry. Is that a crime?""
[Message 74] Liam: ""No, but your timing is atrocious.""
[Message 75] Chloe: ""I'm blocking you for the rest of the day, David.""
[Message 76] Maria: ""Consider yourself muted.""
[Message 77] Ben: ""Seriously, just stop talking.""
[Message 78] David: ""Fine. Whatever. I'll just go get my own lunch.""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Good idea.""
[Message 80] Chloe: ""Finally, some peace and quiet.""
[Message 81] Maria: ""Seriously, though, stapler. Anyone?""
[Message 82] Ben: ""Still not me!""
[Message 83] Liam: ""Maybe check the supply closet?""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""Good call. I'll look later.""
[Message 85] Maria: ""Thanks.""
[Message 86] Ben: ""So...police haven't called anyone yet?""
[Message 87] Liam: ""Not that I know of. I'm surprised, honestly.""
[Message 88] Chloe: ""Maybe they don't have anything yet?""
[Message 89] Maria: ""Or maybe they know more than they're letting on.""
[Message 90] Ben: ""True. They play their cards close to the vest.""
[Message 91] Liam: ""Let's just hope they catch whoever did this.""
[Message 92] Chloe: ""Amen to that.""
[Message 93] Maria: ""Absolutely.""
[Message 94] Ben: ""For sure.""

[Message 98] Ben: ""Same here.""
[Message 99] Liam: ""Good luck, everyone.""
[Message 100] Chloe: ""Hey, did Sarah ever mention anything weird going on? Anything at all?""
[Message 101] Liam: ""Not to me. Why?""
[Message 102] Chloe: ""Just wondering. She said she wanted to get rid of him""
[Message 103] Maria: ""She was pretty private. I didn't know her well enough for that.""
[Message 104] Ben: ""She seemed happy enough. Always smiling.""
[Message 105] David: ""Happy? She was always complaining about something.""
[Message 106] Liam: ""David, stop it.""
[Message 107] Chloe: ""Seriously. Just stop.""
[Message 108] Maria: ""You're making this worse for yourself.""
[Message 109] Ben: ""Just...be quiet.""

[Message 112] Chloe: ""Fine.""
[Message 113] Maria: ""Whatever.""
[Message 114] Ben: ""Alright.""
[Message 115] Liam: ""This is so messed up. I can't believe Sarah is gone. They're going away for a long time for this""
[Message 116] Chloe: ""Yeah, I know. It's hard to process.""
[Message 117] Maria: ""I keep thinking about her family. This must be devastating for them.""
[Message 118] Ben: ""For sure. They're in my thoughts.""

[Message 120] Liam: ""Okay, David. We get it.""
[Message 121] Chloe: ""Hey, Liam, you still there?""
[Message 122] Liam: ""Yeah, Chloe. Just trying to focus.""
[Message 123] Chloe: ""I was thinking...did Sarah have any enemies? Anyone who might want to hurt her?""
[Message 124] Liam: ""Not that I know of. She was pretty well-liked.""
[Message 125] Maria: ""Yeah, she was always nice to everyone.""
[Message 126] Ben: ""Unless...""
[Message 127] Liam: ""Unless what, Ben?""
[Message 128] Ben: ""Unless it was a robbery gone wrong? Maybe she surprised someone?""
[Message 129] Chloe: ""That's a possibility. A sad one, but possible.""
[Message 130] Maria: ""Yeah, that makes sense. This city is getting dangerous.""
[Message 131] David: ""Exactly. Could happen to anyone.""
[Message 132] Liam: ""Let's not speculate. The police will figure it out.""
[Message 133] Chloe: ""I hope so. For Sarah's sake.""
[Message 134] Maria: ""Me too.""
[Message 135] Ben: ""Yeah, definitely.""
[Message 136] David: ""Of course. Justice will be served.""
[Message 137] Liam: ""Alright, everyone. I'm signing off for real now. Need to clear my head.""

[Message 139] Maria: ""Bye, Liam.""
[Message 140] Ben: ""Later, dude.""
[Message 141] David: ""Goodbye.""
[Message 142] Chloe: ""I’m so worried. How did she even die? And was there anything she tried to say that she couldn’t?""
[Message 143] Maria: ""I heard someone say they think it was poisoning via inhalation and the police are reviewing the security tapes now.""
[Message 144] Ben: ""Wow, poisoning via inhalation. That’s dark. Hope they find out who did it and that they don’t get the death penalty.""
[Message 145] David: ""Hope they find them too. I'm sure they are looking into it.""
[Message 146] Chloe: ""David, do you think it’s possible the death was accidental? During a robbery maybe?""
[Message 147] David: ""Could be, but it sounds pretty intentional.""
[Message 148] Ben: ""We should go to the vigil tonight.""

[Message 4] Casey: ""Workout gear? That reminds me, I need to find a decent sports bra. Shopping for those is the worst.""
[Message 5] Riley: ""Tell me about it, Casey! It's like they're designed by aliens who've never seen a human woman.""
[Message 6] Liam: ""Haha, true! I was thinking about grabbing a new flannel shirt. Need something comfy for camping.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Camping? Nice! I just ordered a new smart watch. The battery life is supposed to be incredible.""
[Message 8] Jordan: ""Ooh, which one did you get, Alex? I've been eyeing the latest Fitbits.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Got the Garmin Fenix 7. Pricey, but worth it for the tech.""
[Message 10] Casey: ""Garmin's good. I've heard good things. Back to clothes though - anyone know if Macy's is having a sale?""
[Message 11] Riley: ""Macy's usually has some kind of sale going on. Worth checking their website before heading over.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Good call, Riley. I always forget about online coupons.""
[Message 13] Jordan: ""Speaking of online shopping, I found an amazing deal on headphones yesterday. Noise-cancelling, perfect for the gym.""
[Message 14] Casey: ""Headphones are a must! I can't stand the gym's music.""
[Message 15] Riley: ""Same here. I'm all about my own playlists.""
[Message 16] Alex: ""Music's essential. I've been listening to a lot of ambient stuff lately, helps me focus.""
[Message 17] Liam: ""Focus is good. I've got to reconcile some accounts when I get back. Not exactly exciting.""
[Message 18] Alex: ""Accountant life! My job's pretty similar. We should compare software sometime.""
[Message 19] Jordan: ""I'm actually prepping for a job interview next week. Anyone have any tips on how to ace it?""
[Message 20] Casey: ""Jordan, good luck! Be yourself, be confident, and research the company beforehand.""
[Message 21] Riley: ""Second that, Casey. And practice answering common interview questions.""
[Message 22] Liam: ""Yeah, preparation is key. Also, make sure your outfit is appropriate. Doesn't have to be super fancy, but presentable.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Agreed. Clean and professional. And listen carefully to the questions!""
[Message 24] Jordan: ""Thanks, everyone! I appreciate the advice. Feeling a bit less stressed now.""
[Message 25] Casey: ""No problem! You got this. Back to shopping, though... Anyone seen any cute summer dresses lately?""
[Message 26] Riley: ""H&M usually has a good selection of affordable summer dresses.""
[Message 27] Liam: ""Or maybe try Nordstrom Rack? They have designer stuff at discount prices.""
[Message 28] Alex: ""Nordstrom Rack is a good call. I found some amazing deals on tech accessories there once.""
[Message 29] Jordan: ""Okay, okay, focusing on the here and now... Anyone want to grab some coffee after the hike?""
[Message 30] Casey: ""Coffee sounds perfect! I need a caffeine boost.""
[Message 31] Riley: ""I'm in! Let's find a cute little coffee shop near Easton.""
[Message 32] Liam: ""Definitely coffee. I'm flagging a bit. Maybe that'll give me the energy to actually shop.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Count me in for coffee too. Always up for caffeine and conversation.""
[Message 34] Jordan: ""Awesome! So, coffee and maybe a little window shopping?""
[Message 35] Casey: ""Sounds like a plan! Window shopping is dangerous though, I always end up buying something.""
[Message 36] Riley: ""Haha, same! But that's half the fun, right?""
[Message 37] Liam: ""True. It's all about the experience. Even if I only end up buying a coffee.""
[Message 38] Alex: ""The experience is key. And maybe finding that one perfect item you weren't even looking for.""

[Message 2] Maya: ""Yeah, awful. That poor 10. Social Worker, Alex. So young.""
[Message 3] Chloe: ""I know! It's insane. Dawn, of all times. Who would do that?""
[Message 4] David: ""Heard it was Poisoning via inhalation. Crazy stuff.""
[Message 5] Liam: ""I was actually at the Hotel Lobby last night. Left around 11pm though.""
[Message 6] Maya: ""Really, Liam? Doing what?""
[Message 7] Liam: ""Just grabbing a drink with a friend, Maya. Relax.""
[Message 8] Chloe: ""So scary to think something like that could happen so close to home.""
[Message 9] David: ""True. Makes you wonder who's capable of that.""
[Message 10] Maya: ""David, don't start. Anyone could be. Focus on finding the guilty. ""
[Message 11] David: ""Just saying, Maya. People surprise you.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Did they release any details about the, you know...?""
[Message 13] Chloe: ""Not that I've seen. Just that Alex died. And Poisoning via inhalation.""
[Message 14] Maya: ""Let the police handle the details, guys. We're not detectives.""
[Message 15] David: ""Fine, fine. Just curious.""
[Message 16] Liam: ""I hope they catch whoever did this soon.""
[Message 17] Chloe: ""Me too. Alex didn't deserve that.""
[Message 18] Maya: ""Absolutely not. Such a bright person.""
[Message 19] David: ""Bright person? I barely knew him. Seemed kinda annoying, tbh.""
[Message 20] Maya: ""David! That's a horrible thing to say.""
[Message 21] David: ""What? Just being honest. Everyone's all saints now.""
[Message 22] Liam: ""Lay off, David. Now's not the time.""
[Message 23] Chloe: ""Seriously, David. Have some respect.""

[Message 28] Maya: ""He's just trying to be edgy. Ignore him.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""You think he knows something we don't?""
[Message 30] Chloe: ""Nah, he's just insensitive. Probably playing video games right now.""
[Message 31] Maya: ""True. Anyway, did you see that new exhibit at the museum?""
[Message 32] Liam: ""No, tell me about it.""
[Message 33] Chloe: ""Speaking of exhibits, I wanted to go to the art fair next weekend. Anyone interested?""
[Message 34] Maya: ""I might be. Depends on my schedule.""

[Message 36] Chloe: ""Great! I'll make a group chat closer to the date.""
[Message 37] Maya: ""Sounds good.""
[Message 38] Liam: ""Cool. So, back to the museum...""
[Message 39] Chloe: ""Guys, I just saw something on Facebook. A woman named Sarah is claiming she saw someone matching David's description near the Hotel Lobby around Dawn.""
[Message 40] Maya: ""What?! Seriously?""
[Message 41] Liam: ""David? What was he doing there?""
[Message 42] Chloe: ""I don't know! The post is vague, but it's definitely about the murder.""
[Message 43] Maya: ""We need to ask him about this.""
[Message 44] Liam: ""I'll text him.""
[Message 45] Liam: ""David, hey. Saw a post about someone seeing someone who looks like you near the Hotel Lobby at Dawn. Care to explain?""
[Message 46] David: ""That's BS. I was home sleeping.""
[Message 47] Liam: ""Sarah seems pretty sure.""
[Message 48] David: ""Who the hell is Sarah? Never heard of her.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""Someone who lives in Flint. She said she saw you running away from the hotel at Dawn.""
[Message 50] David: ""Running? I haven't run anywhere in years. I have a bad knee!""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Just saying what she said.""
[Message 52] David: ""She's lying. Trying to stir up trouble. Tell her to get her facts straight.""
[Message 53] Liam: ""Alright, alright. Just wanted to hear your side.""
[Message 54] David: ""Seriously, this is ridiculous. I'm being accused of murder based on some random Facebook post?""
[Message 55] Liam: ""Nobody's accusing you, David. Just trying to understand.""
[Message 56] David: ""Yeah, well, understand this: I was asleep.""
[Message 57] Liam: ""Okay, I believe you.""
[Message 58] David: ""Good. Now leave me alone.""
[Message 59] Liam: ""Will do.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""He says he was home asleep. Claims it's all BS.""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""Hmmm. Seems defensive.""
[Message 62] Maya: ""Very. But he could be telling the truth. People make mistakes.""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""True. But that Sarah is pretty adamant.""
[Message 64] Maya: ""Maybe she saw someone else. Flint isn't exactly a small town.""
[Message 65] Liam: ""Yeah, could be.""
[Message 66] Chloe: ""Guys, I just remembered something. David HATED Alex. He always said Alex was a 'know-it-all'.""
[Message 67] Maya: ""Wait, seriously? I didn't know that.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""Me neither. That changes things.""
[Message 69] Chloe: ""He was always complaining about how Alex got a promotion he wanted.""
[Message 70] Maya: ""Okay, that's a motive. But still doesn't prove anything.""
[Message 71] Liam: ""True. But it makes him look a lot more suspicious.""
[Message 72] Chloe: ""Definitely. We should tell the police about this.""
[Message 73] Maya: ""Agreed. I'll call them.""
[Message 74] Liam: ""Let me know what they say.""
[Message 75] Chloe: ""Yeah, keep us updated.""
[Message 76] Maya: ""Okay, just got off the phone. They said they'll look into it. They're interviewing everyone who was at the hotel that night.""
[Message 77] Liam: ""Good. Hopefully, they'll find something.""
[Message 78] Chloe: ""Fingers crossed.""
[Message 79] Maya: ""So, about the art fair...""
[Message 80] Liam: ""Maybe we should hold off on that for now. Seems a little insensitive.""
[Message 81] Chloe: ""Yeah, you're right. Maybe another time.""
[Message 82] Maya: ""Agreed. We should focus on supporting Alex's family.""
[Message 83] Liam: ""Definitely. I'm sure they're going through hell.""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""I wonder if Alex had any enemies besides David.""
[Message 85] Maya: ""I don't know. He seemed like a pretty likeable person.""
[Message 86] Liam: ""Yeah, he did. Hard to imagine anyone wanting to hurt him.""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""Maybe it was a random act of violence.""
[Message 88] Maya: ""Could be. But it seems too targeted for that.""
[Message 89] Liam: ""Targeted how?""
[Message 90] Maya: ""Poisoning via inhalation like that... Seems planned, not spontaneous.""
[Message 91] Chloe: ""True. Someone knew what they were doing.""
[Message 92] Liam: ""Scary thought.""
[Message 93] Maya: ""Very.""
[Message 94] Chloe: ""Hey, did anyone see that new post from the manager of the hotel?""
[Message 95] Liam: ""No, what'd it say?""
[Message 96] Chloe: ""He said the security cameras were malfunctioning that night.""
[Message 97] Maya: ""Seriously? That's convenient.""
[Message 98] Liam: ""Conveniently suspicious.""
[Message 99] Chloe: ""Exactly! What are the odds?""
[Message 100] Maya: ""Maybe the manager is involved?""
[Message 101] Liam: ""Or covering for someone?""
[Message 102] Chloe: ""Or lying to protect the hotel's reputation?""
[Message 103] Maya: ""So many possibilities.""
[Message 104] Liam: ""We should tell the police about this too.""
[Message 105] Chloe: ""Already on it. Just sent them an email.""
[Message 106] Maya: ""Good work, Chloe.""
[Message 107] Liam: ""Thanks.""
[Message 108] Chloe: ""No problem. Just trying to help.""
[Message 109] Maya: ""We all are.""

[Message 111] Chloe: ""Pretty much. Let the police do their job.""

[Message 114] Chloe: ""Hey, I'm going to go for a walk. Need to clear my head.""
[Message 115] Maya: ""Okay, be careful.""

[Message 117] Chloe: ""Will do. Talk to you later.""
[Message 118] Maya: ""Bye.""
[Message 119] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 120] Liam: ""I keep thinking about Alex. Wonder what he was doing at the hotel so early?""
[Message 121] Maya: ""I have no idea. He was a 10. Social Worker, maybe he was helping someone there?""
[Message 122] Liam: ""Maybe. Or maybe he met someone there.""
[Message 123] Maya: ""Someone he knew? Or a stranger?""
[Message 124] Liam: ""So many questions.""
[Message 125] Maya: ""Too many. It's overwhelming.""
[Message 126] Liam: ""Tell me about it.""

[Message 5] Casey: I'm grateful for a new melody that popped into my head. Feeling inspired in the kitchen lately.
[Message 6] Alex: Love hearing all of these! Mine is simple: I’m grateful for a quiet evening with some jazz.
[Message 7] River: Jazz is the best. What are you listening to, Alex?
[Message 8] Alex: Lately, been on a Miles Davis kick. ""Kind of Blue"" always hits the spot.
[Message 9] Sam: ""Kind of Blue"" is a classic! I prefer something a bit more upbeat, though. What gets you moving, Casey?
[Message 10] Casey: Ooh, I’m a sucker for world music. Something with a good beat that I can chop veggies to.
[Message 11] Jordan: Speaking of moving, anyone going to that open mic night downtown this weekend?
[Message 12] River: Hmm, might be up for it! Depends on the load schedule.
[Message 13] Sam: Open mic sounds fun! I'm in!
[Message 14] Casey: I'd love to, but Saturday is usually my big prep day. Maybe next time.
[Message 15] Alex: I'm tempted! I haven't been to one in ages.
[Message 16] Jordan: Awesome! We should coordinate. Anyway, back to gratitude: I'm also grateful for my car finally starting on the first try this week!

[Message 94] River: I'm grateful for a good CB radio. Keeps me connected on the road.
[Message 95] Sam: Still using a CB radio? That’s awesome!

[Message 115] River: This has been a nice little boost of positivity. I'm grateful for everyone sharing.
[Message 116] Sam: Yeah, me too! Thanks again, Alex.
[Message 117] Jordan: Absolutely! We should do this more often.
[Message 118] Casey: I agree! A little gratitude check-in is always a good idea.

[Message 126] Sam: Ooh, that sounds good! I just started ""Where the Crawdads Sing.""
[Message 127] Jordan: I’m rereading ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" Always a good laugh.
[Message 128] Casey: I’m reading a cookbook, surprise surprise! ""Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat."" It's really informative.
[Message 129] Alex: ""Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat"" is excellent! I’m currently reading a historical fiction novel set in Italy.

[Message 139] Jordan: Haha, me too! It's hard not to.
[Message 140] Casey: I try not to, but sometimes a cover just draws you in.

[Message 142] River: Well, I'm grateful for talented book designers. They deserve credit.

59,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone! So glad we could finally meet up. How was your day?
[Message 2] Jamie: Mine was… eventful. Teacher-student conference. Need I say more?
[Message 3] Sam: Oh dear, Jamie! Hope everything is okay. Mine was alright, pretty standard sales calls.
[Message 4] Alex: Same here, Sam. Long day of calls. Feeling the sunset, though, this is nice.
[Message 5] Jamie: This restaurant booth is cozy. Okay, so, gardening plans anyone?
[Message 6] Sam: Yes! I've been wanting to ask you both. My tomatoes are NOT happy campers.
[Message 7] Alex: Tomatoes can be tricky! Too much water, not enough sun… the drama.
[Message 8] Jamie: Exactly! Speaking of drama, the teacher-student conference was… memorable. Little Timmy decided finger-painting the principal was a good idea.
[Message 9] Sam: Oh my goodness, Jamie! You have my sympathy!
[Message 10] Alex: Wow, Jamie, that's a story! Back to tomatoes – Sam, what kind are you growing?
[Message 11] Sam: Just your basic Roma, I think. Nothing fancy.
[Message 12] Jamie: Roma are usually pretty hardy. Maybe the soil? Have you tested it lately?
[Message 13] Alex: Good point, Jamie. Soil pH is key.
[Message 14] Sam: I haven't tested it recently, no. Where do you even get those kits?
[Message 15] Jamie: Any garden center should have them, Sam. Even some hardware stores.
[Message 16] Alex: Yeah, or online. Amazon has everything, unfortunately.
[Message 17] Sam: True. I'll grab one this weekend.
[Message 18] Jamie: So, Alex, what are you planting this year? Anything exciting?
[Message 19] Alex: I'm attempting a herb garden. Rosemary, thyme, basil… the works!
[Message 20] Sam: Ooh, fancy! I always kill herbs.
[Message 21] Jamie: Me too, Sam. Except mint. Mint takes over the world.
[Message 22] Alex: Haha, so true about the mint! I'm keeping it contained in a pot this time.
[Message 23] Sam: Smart move. I planted it directly in the ground once. HUGE mistake.
[Message 24] Jamie: Learned that the hard way myself.
[Message 25] Alex: Anyone seen that dancing show on TV lately? ""Dance Revolution""?
[Message 26] Sam: Can't say that I have, Alex. I prefer a good book.
[Message 27] Jamie: I've seen a few episodes. Pretty impressive! I prefer singing, though. Karaoke night is my jam.
[Message 28] Alex: Karaoke! Fun! I’m more of a dance floor kind of person.
[Message 29] Sam: You two are so full of energy! I need a nap just thinking about it.
[Message 30] Jamie: Age is just a number, Sam! Plus, you’re only… well, you’re older than us. ;)
[Message 31] Alex: Jamie! Be nice!
[Message 32] Sam: I'm used to it. Back to gardening… any tips for keeping squirrels away? They're eating my strawberries!
[Message 33] Jamie: Ah, the eternal struggle!
[Message 34] Alex: I've heard sprinkling cayenne pepper around works.
[Message 35] Sam: Does that hurt the plants?
[Message 36] Jamie: Not usually, Sam. Just don't overdo it.
[Message 37] Alex: You can also try netting. Annoying to set up, but effective.
[Message 38] Sam: Netting might be the way to go. Thanks, guys!
[Message 39] Jamie: No problem! Happy to help. So, back to Timmy and the finger paint…
[Message 40] Alex: Oh dear, Jamie! Tell us more!
[Message 41] Sam: Yes, I'm morbidly curious.
[Message 42] Jamie: Okay, so the principal...Mrs. Henderson...was not amused.
[Message 43] Alex: I can imagine!
[Message 44] Sam: I'm picturing the scene in my head.
[Message 45] Jamie: It wasn't pretty. Timmy thought it was art, Mrs. Henderson saw… disrespect.
[Message 46] Alex: There's a fine line, isn't there?
[Message 47] Sam: Indeed. So, Jamie, what was the outcome? Detention? Suspension?
[Message 48] Jamie: Thankfully, just a strongly worded conversation with his parents. And a lot of apologies.
[Message 49] Alex: Phew! That could have been worse.
[Message 50] Sam: Definitely. Back to less stressful topics… anyone try that new bakery downtown?
[Message 51] Jamie: Oh, I did! ""Sweet Surrender""? Their croissants are amazing.
[Message 52] Alex: I've heard good things! I need to check it out.
[Message 53] Sam: Maybe we should all go together sometime.
[Message 54] Jamie: I'm in!
[Message 55] Alex: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 56] Sam: Okay, back to my sad tomatoes... besides the soil, any other ideas?
[Message 57] Jamie: Are they getting enough sunlight? Tomatoes need a LOT.
[Message 58] Alex: And are you fertilizing them?
[Message 59] Sam: They're in a pretty sunny spot, I think. And I haven't fertilized them in a while…
[Message 60] Jamie: That could be it! Tomatoes are hungry plants.
[Message 61] Alex: Definitely give them some fertilizer. Tomato-specific is best.
[Message 62] Sam: I'll pick some up with the soil testing kit.
[Message 63] Jamie: Perfect! You'll have delicious tomatoes in no time.
[Message 64] Alex: Hopefully! Gardening is all about patience, isn't it?
[Message 65] Sam: So true. I always get impatient and then things go wrong.
[Message 66] Jamie: Same! I'm trying to be better about that this year.
[Message 67] Alex: Me too! Although my impulsivity doesn't always help.
[Message 68] Sam: Well, at least you're honest!
[Message 69] Jamie: We all have our flaws, Alex! Resilience is key, though!
[Message 70] Alex: True, Jamie! True!
[Message 71] Sam: Has anyone seen that documentary about bees lately?
[Message 72] Jamie: Oh, I think I saw a trailer for it. Is it good?
[Message 73] Alex: I haven't seen it, but I love bees! They're so important for gardening.
[Message 74] Sam: That's what I was thinking. We need to protect them.
[Message 75] Jamie: Absolutely! Plant bee-friendly flowers.
[Message 76] Alex: Yes! Lavender, sunflowers, borage…
[Message 77] Sam: I’ll have to look up a list.
[Message 78] Jamie: I think the Missouri Botanical Garden website has a list of native plants that are good for pollinators.
[Message 79] Alex: Oh, good tip, Jamie!
[Message 80] Sam: Excellent. Thanks!
[Message 81] Jamie: You're welcome! So, anyone have any exciting weekend plans? Besides gardening, of course.
[Message 82] Alex: I'm going dancing on Saturday night!
[Message 83] Sam: Oh, fun! Where are you going?
[Message 84] Alex: That new place downtown, ""The Groove.""
[Message 85] Jamie: Sounds like a blast! I might hit up karaoke night at ""The Rusty Mug.""
[Message 86] Sam: You two are always out having fun! I'll probably just be reading.
[Message 87] Alex: Nothing wrong with that, Sam!
[Message 88] Jamie: Exactly! Sometimes a quiet night is just what you need.
[Message 89] Sam: True. Although, I do get a little stir-crazy sometimes.
[Message 90] Alex: Maybe try a new book genre?
[Message 91] Jamie: Or try singing along to some music while you read! Two birds, one stone!
[Message 92] Sam: Haha! Maybe.
[Message 93] Alex: Alright, I should probably head out soon. Got a big day tomorrow.
[Message 94] Jamie: Me too. Need to mentally prepare for another day of… Timmy.
[Message 95] Sam: I completely understand.
[Message 96] Alex: Thanks for the company, everyone! And the gardening tips!
[Message 97] Jamie: You too, Alex! It was great catching up.
[Message 98] Sam: Yes, it was lovely. Drive safe, Alex!
[Message 99] Alex: Will do! See you both soon!
[Message 100] Jamie: Bye, Alex!
[Message 101] Sam: Goodbye, Alex.
[Message 102] Jamie: So, Sam, anything else you're planting besides tomatoes and strawberries?
[Message 103] Sam: I was thinking about some peppers. Maybe some bell peppers and some jalapenos.
[Message 104] Jamie: Ooh, nice! Jalapenos are always a good idea.
[Message 105] Sam: I like to make salsa.
[Message 106] Jamie: Homemade salsa is the best!
[Message 107] Sam: I agree!
[Message 108] Jamie: Well, I should probably head out too. It's getting late.
[Message 109] Sam: Alright. Thanks for the gardening advice, Jamie.
[Message 110] Jamie: You're welcome, Sam! Anytime. And thanks for listening to my Timmy stories.
[Message 111] Sam: Of course! They're quite entertaining.
[Message 112] Jamie: Haha! Good night, Sam!
[Message 113] Sam: Good night, Jamie. Drive safely.
[Message 114] Jamie: I will!
[Message 115] Sam: I think I will try reading something else tonight. Maybe a mystery novel.
[Message 116] Sam: It's been a while since I delved into that genre.
[Message 117] Sam: I need to be more open to new things.
[Message 118] Sam: I also need to start walking more.
[Message 119] Sam: It's been such a sedentary lifestyle lately.
[Message 120] Sam: I think the garden will help with that.
[Message 121] Sam: Fresh air and sunshine will do me good.
[Message 122] Sam: I'm looking forward to seeing my tomatoes thrive.
[Message 123] Sam: And hopefully those strawberries will produce a nice harvest.
[Message 124] Sam: Maybe I'll even try making some jam.
[Message 125] Sam: That would be a fun project.
[Message 126] Sam: I should research jam-making techniques.
[Message 127] Sam: I think I have some old jars in the basement.
[Message 128] Sam: I hope they're still good.
[Message 129] Sam: I should probably check on them soon.
[Message 130] Sam: I might also need to buy some new lids.
[Message 131] Sam: I think they sell them at the hardware store.
[Message 132] Sam: I really hope this works out.
[Message 133] Sam: It would be so rewarding to make my own jam.
[Message 134] Sam: Maybe I'll even give some away as gifts.

61,"[Message 1] Alice: Hey everyone, how's the Corpus Christi Job Fair going? Still here at midnight!
[Message 2] Bob: Midnight already? Time flies when you're... surrounded by resumes. It's okay, I guess. Lots of eager faces.
[Message 3] Carol: Eager and tired! I'm exhausted. Anyone have any good advice for navigating this whole job search thing?
[Message 4] David: Don't give up! That's my main advice. It can be brutal, but persistence pays off.
[Message 5] Emily: I second that, David. And network, network, network! Even if you're introverted, force yourself to talk to people.
[Message 6] Alice: Networking is key! Also, remember to tailor your resume to each job you apply for. Generic resumes go straight to the trash.
[Message 7] Bob: That's solid advice, Alice. I’ve seen so many generic resumes today.
[Message 8] Carol: Thanks, guys! I'm trying. It just feels overwhelming sometimes.
[Message 9] David: It is overwhelming, Carol. Break it down into smaller tasks. Apply to a few jobs a day, dedicate time to networking, and take breaks!
[Message 10] Emily: Exactly! And don't be afraid to ask for help. Reach out to friends, family, or even people you meet at the job fair.
[Message 11] Alice: Good point, Emily. People are usually more willing to help than you think.
[Message 12] Bob: Yeah, a fresh pair of eyes on your resume can make a big difference.
[Message 13] Carol: Okay, breaking it down into smaller tasks sounds manageable. Thanks for the advice!
[Message 14] David: You got this, Carol! We all believe in you.
[Message 15] Emily: Absolutely! Remember your worth.
[Message 16] Alice: Speaking of breaking things down, I have a doctor's appointment next week. Anyone have any tips for getting the most out of it? I always feel like I forget to ask important questions.
[Message 17] Bob: Write down your questions beforehand! That's the best advice I can give.
[Message 18] Carol: Good idea, Bob! I always forget too.
[Message 19] David: And be honest with your doctor. They can't help you if you're not truthful about your symptoms.
[Message 20] Emily: Totally agree, David. Honesty is crucial.
[Message 21] Alice: Writing down questions and being honest. Got it! Thanks, everyone.
[Message 22] Bob: No problem, Alice. Hope it goes well!
[Message 23] Carol: Me too! Let us know how it goes.
[Message 24] David: By the way, anyone else having trouble sleeping lately? I've been tossing and turning for weeks.
[Message 25] Emily: Oh man, me too! I think it's the stress of this whole job search thing.
[Message 26] Alice: Maybe try some relaxation techniques before bed? Like deep breathing or meditation.
[Message 27] Bob: Warm milk can help too. Old wives' tale, but it works for some people.
[Message 28] Carol: I've heard chamomile tea is good for sleep.
[Message 29] David: I'll try anything at this point. Thanks for the suggestions!
[Message 30] Emily: Don't drink caffeine after noon! That's a big one.
[Message 31] Alice: Good point, Emily. Caffeine can really mess with your sleep.
[Message 32] Bob: And try to establish a regular sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.
[Message 33] Carol: That's hard, Bob! Weekends are for sleeping in.
[Message 34] David: I know, Carol, but it's worth a try.
[Message 35] Emily: Yeah, consistency is key.
[Message 36] Alice: Okay, back to job fair advice. What's your take on cover letters? Necessary or outdated?
[Message 37] Bob: Definitely necessary. It's your chance to really sell yourself and explain why you're a good fit for the company.
[Message 38] Carol: I agree, Bob. Cover letters are important.
[Message 39] David: I think it depends on the job. Some companies don't even read them.
[Message 40] Emily: Yeah, it's hard to say for sure. But it's better to be safe than sorry.
[Message 41] Alice: So, err on the side of writing a cover letter?
[Message 42] Bob: Yep. Always write a cover letter.
[Message 43] Carol: Unless the job posting specifically says not to.
[Message 44] David: True, Carol. Always follow the instructions in the job posting.
[Message 45] Emily: Exactly. Read everything carefully.
[Message 46] Alice: Okay, makes sense. Thanks!
[Message 47] Bob: No problem!
[Message 48] Carol: Any other burning questions?
[Message 49] David: What about follow-up emails after an interview? How soon is too soon?
[Message 50] Emily: I usually send one within 24 hours. It shows you're interested and grateful for the opportunity.
[Message 51] Alice: Agreed. 24 hours is a good rule of thumb.
[Message 52] Bob: I’d say thank them and reiterate your interest.
[Message 53] Carol: What if you don't hear back after a week? Is it okay to follow up again?
[Message 54] David: Definitely. It shows you're still interested and haven't forgotten about the position.
[Message 55] Emily: Just be polite and professional. Don't be pushy or demanding.
[Message 56] Alice: And maybe mention something specific from the interview to remind them who you are.
[Message 57] Bob: Good idea, Alice. That shows you were paying attention.
[Message 58] Carol: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, everyone!
[Message 59] David: No problem, Carol. We're all in this together.
[Message 60] Emily: Speaking of being in this together, anyone want to grab some coffee? I'm starting to crash.
[Message 61] Alice: Coffee sounds amazing! I'm in.
[Message 62] Bob: I could use a caffeine boost. Count me in.
[Message 63] Carol: Me too! Let's go!
[Message 64] David: I’ll pass, but thanks. Need to head home. Been a long day.
[Message 65] Emily: Alright, David. Get some rest!
[Message 66] Alice: See you tomorrow, David!
[Message 67] Bob: Sleep well!
[Message 68] Carol: Bye, David!
[Message 69] David: Thanks, guys. See ya!
[Message 70] Emily: Okay, coffee time! Anyone know a good place open this late?
[Message 71] Alice: There's a 24-hour diner down the street.
[Message 72] Bob: Perfect! Let's go!
[Message 73] Carol: Lead the way!
[Message 74] Alice: This job fair has been more draining than I thought.
[Message 75] Bob: Tell me about it. My feet are killing me.
[Message 76] Carol: My brain is fried.
[Message 77] Emily: At least we're all in the same boat.
[Message 78] Alice: True. Misery loves company, right?
[Message 79] Bob: Something like that.
[Message 80] Carol: Coffee will fix everything.
[Message 81] Emily: I hope so!
[Message 82] Alice: So, after we conquer the job market, what's next? Vacation?
[Message 83] Bob: A long, relaxing vacation sounds amazing.
[Message 84] Carol: I'd love to go to the beach.
[Message 85] Emily: Me too! Somewhere with white sand and clear water.
[Message 86] Alice: I'm dreaming of a mountain cabin. Cozy and secluded.
[Message 87] Bob: Both sound great!
[Message 88] Carol: Maybe we should all go on a group vacation once we land jobs!
[Message 89] Emily: That would be awesome!
[Message 90] Alice: I'm in!
[Message 91] Bob: I'm game!
[Message 92] Carol: Let's make it happen!
[Message 93] Emily: We'll need to start planning now!
[Message 94] Alice: First things first, let's get that coffee.
[Message 95] Bob: Agreed!
[Message 96] Carol: Coffee is our priority.
[Message 97] Emily: Absolutely.
[Message 98] Alice: This is going to be a long night.
[Message 99] Bob: Hopefully worth it in the end.
[Message 100] Carol: We'll see!
[Message 101] Emily: Keeping my fingers crossed.
[Message 102] Alice: Anyone have any weird job interview stories?
[Message 103] Bob: Oh man, I have a ton.
[Message 104] Carol: Spill the tea!
[Message 105] Emily: I'm all ears.
[Message 106] Alice: Let's hear it, Bob!
[Message 107] Bob: Okay, so I once had an interview where the interviewer's phone rang, and he answered it and had a full-blown conversation about what he was having for dinner.
[Message 108] Carol: No way!
[Message 109] Emily: That's unbelievable!
[Message 110] Alice: That's so unprofessional!
[Message 111] Bob: I know, right? I was completely dumbfounded.
[Message 112] Carol: What did you do?
[Message 113] Emily: Did you say anything?
[Message 114] Alice: I'm dying to know.
[Message 115] Bob: I just sat there awkwardly until he finished his phone call. Then we resumed the interview like nothing happened.
[Message 116] Carol: That's hilarious!
[Message 117] Emily: You handled that like a champ!
[Message 118] Alice: Seriously! You deserve an award for that.
[Message 119] Bob: Thanks! It was definitely a memorable experience.
[Message 120] Carol: My turn. I once showed up to an interview, and the interviewer was wearing a full clown costume.
[Message 121] Emily: A clown costume?!
[Message 122] Alice: You're kidding!
[Message 123] Bob: No way!
[Message 124] Carol: I swear! I have no idea why. It was the strangest thing I've ever seen.
[Message 125] Emily: Did you ask him about it?
[Message 126] Alice: I would have been so confused.
[Message 127] Bob: I’d have walked out.
[Message 128] Carol: I didn't ask. I was too scared. I just answered his questions and tried to ignore the clown costume.
[Message 129] Emily: That's amazing. You're braver than I am.
[Message 130] Alice: I think we all need more coffee.
[Message 131] Bob: Agreed. These stories are wild.
[Message 132] Carol: Definitely need caffeine to process this.
[Message 133] Emily: Let's go!
[Message 134] Alice: This coffee better be strong.
[Message 135] Bob: The strongest they've got.
[Message 136] Carol: I'm practically sleepwalking.
[Message 137] Emily: Almost there!
[Message 138] Alice: I can smell the coffee already.
[Message 139] Bob: My savior!
[Message 140] Carol: Thank goodness.
[Message 141] Emily: We made it!
[Message 142] Alice: Let's order!

[Message 2] Chloe: Yeah, awful. Poor Danny...
[Message 3] Maya: I know, right? He was always so nice. Did you know him well?
[Message 4] Chloe: I’d see him around, grabbed a drink from him a few times. You?
[Message 5] Maya: Just the same. So messed up.
[Message 6] Chloe: The cops were asking about everyone who worked there, too. I told them I was home all night.
[Message 7] Maya: Me too. Watched some garbage reality TV. Air tight alibi lol.
[Message 8] Ben: Hey, either of you know why the cops are asking about Donnie?
[Message 9] Maya: Donnie? No idea. What's he got to do with it?
[Message 10] Chloe: I thought he was out of town. I saw him at the store last night around 6. He was buying Administering a lethal injection for his wife.
[Message 11] Ben: He was supposed to be in Syracuse. Weird.
[Message 12] Maya: Maybe he came back early? Who knows. Anyway, this is depressing. Anyone up for happy hour tomorrow, somewhere NOT Tunnel?
[Message 13] Chloe: I’m in. Need a stiff drink.
[Message 14] Ben: Count me in too. I need to get my mind off things.
[Message 15] Sarah: Hey guys, any idea what's going on with Donnie? The cops keep calling me about him.
[Message 16] Maya: They're asking about him in relation to Danny's murder. Apparently, he’s a suspect.
[Message 17] Sarah: Seriously? Donnie? That’s insane. He wouldn’t hurt a fly.
[Message 18] Ben: That’s what I thought too. Unless… did he ever mention anything about Danny? Like, bad blood or something?
[Message 19] Sarah: No! Never! He actually always said Danny made a good drink. He did seem stressed lately, though. Business stuff, I think.
[Message 20] Chloe: Stress? He purposefully signed that deal to ruin Danny.
[Message 21] Sarah: What deal? I don't know anything about that.
[Message 22] Maya: I think Chloe's referring to the bar supply contract. Donnie outbid Danny's usual supplier.
[Message 23] Sarah: Oh, right. Still, doesn't mean he'd kill someone!
[Message 24] Ben: Okay, okay, let’s not jump to conclusions. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding. I saw him leave the building at Dawn.
[Message 25] Maya: Dawn? Isn't that when...?
[Message 26] Ben: Yeah. But he could've just been leaving work.
[Message 27] Sarah: He's gonna go away for a long time for this.
[Message 28] Chloe: Poor Danny.
[Message 29] Maya: This whole thing is just... crazy.
[Message 30] Ben: I just hope they catch the right person.
[Message 31] Chloe: Me too.
[Message 32] Sarah: Guys, can we please not talk about this anymore? I'm getting a really bad feeling.
[Message 33] Maya: Sure, Sarah. Sorry. Let’s just focus on happy hour tomorrow.
[Message 34] Ben: Agreed.
[Message 35] Chloe: So, Donnie and Danny were rivals?
[Message 36] Maya: In a way, yes. Donnie knew Danny was having trouble with sales.
[Message 37] Ben: Remember when Lily got fired? Donnie was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 38] Sarah: Yeah... that was rough. She shouldn't have been shouting like that, probably provoked him.
[Message 39] Chloe: Exactly, and now look what happened.

[Message 2] Bethany: Agnes! Hi! I'm doing well, just got off work. How about you?
[Message 3] Carol: Hi Agnes! Bethany! Things are okay here. Trying to find a good book to read.
[Message 4] Doris: Hello ladies. It's been a while indeed. I'm alright, just finished a big project.
[Message 5] Bethany: Carol, what kind of books are you into?
[Message 6] Carol: Lately, I've been craving something historical. Maybe some historical fiction?
[Message 7] Agnes: I've been meaning to pick up drawing again. Haven't touched my pencils in ages!
[Message 8] Doris: Agnes, you should! It's a great way to relax.
[Message 9] Bethany: Historical fiction is great! Have you read ""The Nightingale"" by Kristin Hannah?
[Message 10] Carol: No, I haven't! Is it good?
[Message 11] Bethany: Absolutely! It's set in France during World War II. Very moving.
[Message 12] Agnes: That sounds interesting, Bethany. I might check that out too, even though I'm not much of a reader.
[Message 13] Doris: I just finished a biography of Marie Curie. Fascinating woman.
[Message 14] Carol: Marie Curie! That's amazing, Doris. I've always admired her.
[Message 15] Bethany: Biographies are great. You learn so much.
[Message 16] Agnes: Speaking of learning, anyone know where I can find good drawing tutorials online?
[Message 17] Doris: YouTube is a treasure trove, Agnes. Search for beginner drawing tutorials.
[Message 18] Bethany: Proko is a good YouTube channel for drawing, Agnes. I think my niece recommended it to me once.
[Message 19] Carol: Thanks for the recommendation, Bethany! I might look it up too, just out of curiosity.
[Message 20] Agnes: Thanks Bethany and Doris! I'll check those out.
[Message 21] Doris: So, Carol, anything else you've been considering reading?
[Message 22] Carol: I've also been thinking about trying a mystery novel. Something with a good plot twist.
[Message 23] Bethany: ""The Silent Patient"" by Alex Michaelides is a really good mystery!
[Message 24] Agnes: Oh, I think I saw that one at the bookstore!
[Message 25] Doris: I enjoy a good mystery. Keeps your mind sharp.
[Message 26] Carol: I'll add that to my list, Bethany! Thanks!
[Message 27] Bethany: No problem! Happy reading.
[Message 28] Agnes: Has anyone seen any good movies lately? Completely off-topic, I know!
[Message 29] Doris: I watched a documentary about space exploration the other day. Very inspiring.
[Message 30] Carol: I haven't been to the movies in ages!
[Message 31] Bethany: I haven't either. I mostly watch things at home these days.
[Message 32] Agnes: Yeah, same here. Easier that way.
[Message 33] Doris: What are you working on next, Agnes? Any big construction projects?
[Message 34] Agnes: Just finishing up a small house renovation. Nothing too exciting.
[Message 35] Carol: Sounds like hard work!
[Message 36] Agnes: It is, but I enjoy it. Keeps me active.
[Message 37] Bethany: Speaking of active, I need to get back to my gardening soon. The weeds are taking over!
[Message 38] Doris: Gardening is wonderful. So therapeutic.
[Message 39] Carol: I wish I had a green thumb! I can barely keep a cactus alive.
[Message 40] Bethany: Haha, it takes practice, Carol.
[Message 41] Agnes: My garden is mostly just weeds too!
[Message 42] Doris: Anyway, back to books, has anyone read anything by Jane Austen recently?
[Message 43] Bethany: I reread ""Pride and Prejudice"" every year. It's a classic!
[Message 44] Carol: I love Jane Austen! ""Sense and Sensibility"" is my favorite.
[Message 45] Agnes: I've never read Jane Austen. Maybe I should give it a try.
[Message 46] Doris: You absolutely should, Agnes! Her writing is timeless.
[Message 47] Bethany: Definitely! It's a good place to start.
[Message 48] Carol: I agree! ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a good introduction to her work.
[Message 49] Agnes: Okay, you've convinced me! I'll add it to my list.
[Message 50] Doris: Excellent! Let us know what you think.
[Message 51] Bethany: Are there any book adaptations that you all enjoy?
[Message 52] Carol: I really liked the ""Little Women"" adaptation from a few years ago.
[Message 53] Doris: The BBC adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth is iconic.
[Message 54] Agnes: I think I saw that one a long time ago!
[Message 55] Bethany: Agreed, Doris! It's a classic adaptation.
[Message 56] Carol: What about you, Bethany? Any favorite adaptations?
[Message 57] Bethany: I quite liked the recent ""Dune"" adaptation. It captured the atmosphere well.
[Message 58] Agnes: I've heard good things about that one!
[Message 59] Doris: I haven't seen it yet. I'll have to check it out.
[Message 60] Carol: Me neither! Added to my watchlist.
[Message 61] Bethany: It's worth a watch, I think.
[Message 62] Agnes: Well, it's getting late. I should probably head to bed.
[Message 63] Doris: Yes, me too. It was nice catching up with everyone.
[Message 64] Carol: Agreed! Goodnight, everyone!
[Message 65] Bethany: Goodnight! It was lovely chatting.
[Message 66] Agnes: Goodnight everyone! Hope you all have a good week.

[Message 4] NOAH: Who were they?
[Message 5] CHLOE: I think one was Sarah, a social worker.
[Message 6] LIAM: And the other was a cop. Name was Alex.
[Message 7] MAYA: Alex? I knew Alex, vaguely. Used to see her at the coffee shop.
[Message 8] NOAH: Crap. This is way too close to home.
[Message 9] CHLOE: Seriously! Makes you think.
[Message 10] LIAM: Think what?
[Message 11] CHLOE: Just... about safety. About knowing your neighbors.
[Message 12] MAYA: Agreed. So scary.
[Message 13] NOAH: Did they say how it happened?
[Message 14] CHLOE: Shooting, I think.
[Message 15] LIAM: Yeah, shooting. Handgun.
[Message 16] MAYA: Ugh, terrible.
[Message 17] NOAH: Anyone know anything more?
[Message 18] CHLOE: Just what's on the news.
[Message 19] LIAM: Same here. I'm going to head to bed. This is creeping me out.

[Message 21] NOAH: Night.
[Message 22] CHLOE: Night, guys.
[Message 23] LIAM: Hey, Maya, you heading to that convention next month?
[Message 24] MAYA: The comic one? Maybe. Still deciding. You?
[Message 25] LIAM: Yeah, probably.
[Message 26] MAYA: Cool. Might see you there.
[Message 27] LIAM: For sure!
[Message 28] CHLOE: Guys, seriously, can we talk about something else? This is depressing.
[Message 29] NOAH: True. Anyone watching that new show on Netflix?
[Message 30] LIAM: Which one?
[Message 31] NOAH: The sci-fi one, ""Echo Chamber.""
[Message 32] CHLOE: Oh yeah, I heard it's good.
[Message 33] MAYA: I started it. Pretty interesting.
[Message 34] LIAM: I'll check it out. Thanks, Noah.
[Message 35] NOAH: No prob.
[Message 36] CHLOE: So, Maya, anything exciting happening with you?
[Message 37] MAYA: Not really. Just work, same old same old. You?
[Message 38] CHLOE: I'm thinking about taking a pottery class.
[Message 39] LIAM: That sounds fun!
[Message 40] NOAH: Yeah, you should do it, Chloe.
[Message 41] CHLOE: I think I will. I need a hobby.
[Message 42] MAYA: Me too. I just binge-watch TV.
[Message 43] LIAM: We all do.
[Message 44] NOAH: Anyone know River? She lives near Public Square.
[Message 45] CHLOE: River? I don't think so.
[Message 46] MAYA: I think I've seen her around. Small build, right?
[Message 47] NOAH: Yeah, that's her.
[Message 48] LIAM: Why? What about her?
[Message 49] NOAH: Just wondering if she knew anything. She lives so close.
[Message 50] CHLOE: You think she saw something?
[Message 51] MAYA: Maybe.
[Message 52] LIAM: Maybe the cops should talk to her.
[Message 53] NOAH: They probably will.
[Message 54] CHLOE: Let's just leave it to the police, guys.
[Message 55] MAYA: Good point.
[Message 56] LIAM: Yeah, you're right.
[Message 57] NOAH: Okay, okay. Just curious.
[Message 58] CHLOE: This whole thing is just... sad. Sarah was always trying to help people.

[Message 68] NOAH: Something about this whole thing with Sarah and Alex is bugging me.
[Message 69] MAYA: What do you mean?

[Message 83] LIAM: Me three.
[Message 84] NOAH: Did Alex ever mention anything weird happening at work?
[Message 85] CHLOE: I wouldn't know. I didn't know Alex.
[Message 86] MAYA: I only saw her at the coffee shop. Never spoke to her.
[Message 87] LIAM: I didn't know her at all.
[Message 88] NOAH: Just wondering if she had any enemies or anything.
[Message 89] CHLOE: Noah, seriously, stop. You're going to start spreading rumors.
[Message 90] MAYA: Yeah, let the police do their job.
[Message 91] LIAM: Agreed.

[Message 95] LIAM: I'm in!
[Message 96] NOAH: Sure, why not.
[Message 97] CHLOE: Sounds good. Where?
[Message 98] MAYA: How about that new place downtown? ""The Daily Grind?""

[Message 100] NOAH: I'm game.
[Message 101] CHLOE: Okay, ""The Daily Grind"" it is. What time?
[Message 102] MAYA: How about 10 am?
[Message 103] LIAM: Perfect.
[Message 104] NOAH: Works for me.
[Message 105] CHLOE: See you all tomorrow then.
[Message 106] MAYA: Great! Looking forward to it.
[Message 107] LIAM: Me too.

[Message 110] LIAM: Yeah, just... thinking.
[Message 111] MAYA: About what?
[Message 112] LIAM: This whole case. It's just messed up. I was aware that Alex's job was dangerous.
[Message 113] MAYA: I know. It is.
[Message 114] LIAM: It's making me rethink a lot of things. The Daily Grind sounds like it will be fun though.
[Message 115] MAYA: Me too. We all need a break.

[Message 9] Sam: Tragic.
[Message 10] Maria: So sad for their families.
[Message 11] Omar: Anyone know how it happened?

[Message 72] Layla: The way he was so quick to name Kai as a suspect. Felt…off.
[Message 73] Maria: I thought so too. And how he immediately apologized. Too eager.
[Message 74] Layla: Exactly! I was at the gas station earlier, and the cashier said someone was looking up how to make Asphyxiation by strangulation online there.
[Message 75] Maria: What?! Did he say who?
[Message 76] Layla: No, but it was someone buying a black lighter and rope earlier that night. It might not be him.
[Message 77] Maria: Oh my god.
[Message 78] Layla: I know, right? I’m not saying it WAS Sam, but… it’s suspicious.
[Message 79] Maria: Very. I think we should tell the police.
[Message 80] Layla: Maybe. But we don't have any proof. I intended to see what he does next.
[Message 81] Maria: True. We need to be careful.
[Message 82] Layla: Agreed. Don't say anything to the others yet.
[Message 83] Maria: Promise.
[Message 84] Layla: Thanks. Feel a little better getting that off my chest.
[Message 85] Maria: Me too. Get some sleep, Layla.
[Message 86] Layla: You too. Night.
[Message 87] Maria: Night.
[Message 88] Omar: (Next morning) Anyone heard anything new?
[Message 89] Kai: Nothing. Still waiting to hear back from the police.
[Message 90] Sam: I’m still feeling awful about yesterday. Sorry again, Kai.
[Message 91] Kai: It's okay, Sam. Just try to be more careful.
[Message 92] Maria: Yeah, Sam. Words matter.
[Message 93] Omar: Agreed.
[Message 94] Layla: Hey guys, I was thinking… maybe we should all just stay away from social media for a while?
[Message 95] Kai: Good idea. It’s all toxic anyway.
[Message 96] Sam: I can do that.
[Message 97] Maria: I agree. It's for the best.
[Message 98] Omar: Sounds good to me.
[Message 99] Layla: We should meet up, grab lunch and talk about this in person.
[Message 100] Kai: I’m in. Need a distraction.
[Message 101] Sam: I can’t. I’m really busy today.
[Message 102] Maria: I can do lunch.
[Message 103] Omar: I’m free too.
[Message 104] Layla: Okay, Maria and Omar, let’s meet at that diner downtown at noon?
[Message 105] Maria: Sounds good.
[Message 106] Omar: See you there.
[Message 107] Sam: Sorry I can’t make it. Catch you guys later.
[Message 108] Kai: No worries, Sam.
[Message 109] Maria: See ya.
[Message 110] Omar: Later.
[Message 111] Layla: (Later, to Maria) Sam's absence seems convenient.
[Message 112] Maria: It really does.
[Message 113] Omar: (At the diner) This is so messed up. Bailey didn't deserve any of this.
[Message 114] Maria: No one does. And that young guy… what was his name, Ben? Such a waste.
[Message 115] Layla: Ben... yes, the newspapers mentioned him. I hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 116] Omar: Me too. This city is starting to feel unsafe.
[Message 117] Maria: It always had its problems, but this is different. This feels personal.
[Message 118] Layla: I agree. We should all be careful. I heard that one of the suspects had a vendetta that they had to settle.
[Message 119] Omar: A vendetta? Against who?
[Message 120] Maria: I don’t know. I think it was a personal matter.
[Message 121] Layla: It’s all so vague and confusing.
[Message 122] Omar: Maybe we should just let the police handle it.
[Message 123] Maria: Probably the best idea.
[Message 124] Layla: Agreed.
[Message 125] Omar: Anyone want dessert?
[Message 126] Maria: I’m good.
[Message 127] Layla: Me neither. Thanks though.
[Message 128] Omar: Alright, I’m gonna head out. Got some errands to run.
[Message 129] Maria: Okay, Omar. Be safe.
[Message 130] Layla: Yeah, see ya.
[Message 131] Omar: Later.
[Message 132] Maria: (To Layla, after Omar leaves) I’m still worried about Sam.
[Message 133] Layla: Me too. We should follow him.
[Message 134] Maria: What? Are you serious?
[Message 135] Layla: Yeah! What if he's planning something else? Or trying to cover his tracks?
[Message 136] Maria: That's… risky. But I understand.
[Message 137] Layla: I know it is, but I can’t shake this feeling.
[Message 138] Maria: Okay, let’s do it. But we have to be careful.
[Message 139] Layla: Agreed. We’ll stick to the shadows.
[Message 140] Maria: Let’s go then.
[Message 141] Layla: Right behind you.
[Message 142] Sam: (Later that day, to Kai) Hey, man, I'm really sorry again about yesterday.
[Message 143] Kai: It's fine, Sam. Really.
[Message 144] Sam: I just feel terrible. I didn't mean to cause any trouble.
[Message 145] Kai: I know, I know.
[Message 146] Sam: You’re not still mad, are you?
[Message 147] Kai: No, man. I told you, it's fine.
[Message 148] Sam: Thanks, Kai. You're a good friend.
[Message 149] Kai: Sure.
[Message 150] Sam: I was thinking, maybe we could grab a beer later? To bury the hatchet?
[Message 151] Kai: I’m not really in the mood for drinking.
[Message 152] Sam: Oh, okay. No problem. Maybe another time.
[Message 153] Kai: Yeah, maybe.
[Message 154] Sam: Just wanted to make sure we’re cool.
[Message 155] Kai: We’re cool, Sam. Don’t worry about it.
[Message 156] Sam: Alright. Thanks again, Kai.
[Message 157] Kai: No problem.
[Message 158] Layla: (To Maria, via text) I saw Sam buying a plane ticket. One way.
[Message 159] Maria: What?! Where to?
[Message 160] Layla: I couldn’t see. He was hiding the screen. But it’s definitely a one-way ticket.
[Message 161] Maria: He’s running. We need to tell the police now.
[Message 162] Layla: Agreed. This is it. I'm going to call them now.
[Message 163] Maria: Good. Let’s hope they can catch him before he gets away.
[Message 164] Layla: They have to.
[Message 165] Maria: This whole thing is a nightmare.
[Message 166] Layla: Tell me about it. I hope they're punished and get a long sentence for this.
[Message 167] Maria: Me too. I hope Bailey and Ben can finally rest in peace.
[Message 168] Kai: (A few days later) Heard they caught Sam at the airport.
[Message 169] Omar: Seriously?
[Message 170] Layla: Yeah, it’s on the news.
[Message 171] Maria: I saw it too. Thank god.
[Message 172] Kai: Guess he was guilty after all.
[Message 173] Omar: Seems like it.
[Message 174] Layla: I was so tired of all the anxiety. Now, hopefully, peace comes.
[Message 175] Maria: Let's all try to move on from this.
[Message 176] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 177] Omar: Yeah. It’s over.
[Message 178] Layla: (A week later, to Maria) I’ve been thinking… something still doesn’t feel right.
[Message 179] Maria: What do you mean? They caught Sam.
[Message 180] Layla: I know, but... why would he buy a plane ticket? It's so obvious.
[Message 181] Maria: Maybe he panicked?
[Message 182] Layla: Maybe. But what if he was running interference? Making himself look guilty to protect someone else? He always hated Bailey so maybe that’s why.
[Message 183] Maria: Who else would be involved?
[Message 184] Layla: I don't know. But I can’t shake the feeling that we're missing something.
[Message 185] Maria: Who do you think he may be protecting then?
[Message 186] Layla: I think Kai might have been involved. 
[Message 187] Maria: But why would Sam protect him?
[Message 188] Layla: I am aware they've been friends for years. Maybe he thought helping Kai would fix whatever mess he was in.
[Message 189] Maria: That would make sense. What are we going to do?
[Message 190] Layla: We have to tell the police. Again. Even if they don't believe us.
[Message 191] Maria: I'm with you. Let's go.
[Message 192] Layla: (The next day) The police searched Kai's apartment. They found blood that matched Ben's DNA.
[Message 193] Maria: So, he was involved after all. Sam covered for him.
[Message 194] Layla: Exactly. Sam’s going away for a long time for this.
[Message 195] Maria: I am so glad this whole thing is over.",1,
79,"[Message 1] David: Hey everyone, interesting exhibit, huh? Makes you think.
[Message 2] Sarah: Definitely, David. I'm struck by the artist's commentary on... well, everything.
[Message 3] Maria: I'm still trying to figure out what half of it means! But I appreciate the effort.
[Message 4] Alex: Some of it's a bit much for me, but I see the appeal.
[Message 5] David: Speaking of commentary, did anyone catch the mayoral debate last night?
[Message 6] Sarah: I did! It was… spirited, to say the least.
[Message 7] Maria: Spirited is one word for it. I thought they were going to come to blows!
[Message 8] Alex: Missed it. Anything worth noting?
[Message 9] David: Lots of posturing, promises, and very little substance, if you ask me.
[Message 10] Sarah: I thought Candidate Thompson made some interesting points about education reform.
[Message 11] Maria: Oh yeah, the teacher-student conference thing? My niece is a teacher; she's got opinions.
[Message 12] Alex: What's the proposal exactly? I'm out of the loop.
[Message 13] David: Something about increased funding for parent-teacher conferences and smaller class sizes.
[Message 14] Sarah: Exactly. It could make a real difference.
[Message 15] Maria: My niece says it sounds good on paper, but the devil's in the details. Funding, implementation... it's all complicated.
[Message 16] Alex: True. Sounds like another empty promise then.
[Message 17] David: I wouldn't go that far, Alex. Every little bit helps, right?
[Message 18] Sarah: I agree with David. We need to be proactive about improving our schools.
[Message 19] Maria: Proactive is good, but let's be realistic. Schools need more than just talk.
[Message 20] Alex: What do you think they really need, Maria?
[Message 21] Maria: Smaller class sizes, better pay for teachers, more resources... the whole shebang.
[Message 22] David: All of which costs money. And where's that going to come from?
[Message 23] Sarah: That's the million-dollar question, isn't it? Maybe Candidate Miller's tax plan?
[Message 24] Alex: Taxes? Nobody wants to pay more taxes.
[Message 25] Maria: Easier said than done, Alex. Everything costs money. Speaking of which, anyone hungry?
[Message 26] David: Getting there. This art is making me work up an appetite.
[Message 27] Sarah: I could definitely go for some coffee.
[Message 28] Alex: Coffee sounds good. Maybe that place down the street? ""The Daily Grind?""
[Message 29] Maria: Lead the way! Back to politics, though… the Miller plan seemed a little vague to me.
[Message 30] David: Vague is putting it mildly. He talks a big game, but doesn't offer specifics.
[Message 31] Sarah: I'm concerned about the impact on small businesses.
[Message 32] Alex: Small businesses are the backbone of our economy!
[Message 33] Maria: Exactly! They need support, not more burdens. I saw this amazing bakery downtown, they use only local ingredients.
[Message 34] David: Focusing on local businesses is key. Creates jobs and strengthens the community.
[Message 35] Sarah: Agreed. Maybe the candidates should spend less time arguing and more time listening to the community.
[Message 36] Alex: Amen to that.
[Message 37] Maria: So, is anyone leaning towards a particular candidate yet?
[Message 38] David: Still undecided. Need to do more research.
[Message 39] Sarah: Same here. I want to see their full platforms.
[Message 40] Alex: I'm usually apathetic, but this election actually feels important.
[Message 41] Maria: They all say that every election is the ""most important ever.""
[Message 42] David: True, but this one feels… different. The stakes are higher.
[Message 43] Sarah: I think it's because people are finally starting to pay attention.
[Message 44] Alex: Or maybe we're just getting older and more cynical.
[Message 45] Maria: Cynical? Speak for yourself, Alex!
[Message 46] David: Let's try to stay positive, folks. Coffee first, then world domination, right?
[Message 47] Sarah: I like that plan, David!
[Message 48] Alex: Coffee sounds like a good first step.
[Message 49] Maria: What kind of coffee do they have? I need something strong!
[Message 50] David: I'm easy. Just black coffee for me.
[Message 51] Sarah: Latte, please! Extra foam.
[Message 52] Alex: Just a regular coffee for me.
[Message 53] Maria: Okay, let's move this operation to ""The Daily Grind."" Politics can wait a few minutes.
[Message 54] David: Agreed. My brain needs a break.
[Message 55] Sarah: It's just around the corner, right?
[Message 56] Alex: Yep, just past that bookstore.
[Message 57] Maria: Great! Let's go!
[Message 58] David: Sounds good. Maybe we can talk about travel plans next time?
[Message 59] Sarah: I'd love that, David! I'm always looking for travel inspiration.
[Message 60] Alex: I'm stuck on local politics at the moment, but travel sounds good later.
[Message 61] Maria: Let’s definitely do that! After all this talking about serious stuff, I need a vacation!
[Message 62] David: You and me both, Maria.
[Message 63] Sarah: Okay, coffee shop now! Let’s go!

[Message 6] Chloe: Awful. I was just there yesterday.

[Message 7] Sarah: Me too! Early morning though.

[Message 8] Mark: I saw Ben near the Public Restroom Mid-Morning yesterday. Anyone know if he knew 10. Social Worker?

[Message 9] Chloe: Ben? Isn't he the one with the Deep voice? What was he doing there?

[Message 10] Sarah: No idea. Ben's usually pretty quiet.

[Message 11] Mark: He looked kinda stressed.

[Message 12] Chloe: Stress can do crazy things to people.

[Message 13] Sarah: You thinking what I'm thinking?

[Message 14] Mark: Maybe?

[Message 15] Chloe: Don't jump to conclusions. Let's see what the cops find out.

[Message 16] Sarah: True. Though, didn’t Amy hate 10. Social Worker?

[Message 17] Mark: Amy? Why?

[Message 18] Sarah: Something about a promotion she didn’t get? She said she wanted to get rid of him.

[Message 19] Chloe: Wow, Amy... that’s messed up if she had something to do with this.

[Message 20] Mark: Yeah. Remember that romantic rival she had to eliminate?

[Message 21] Sarah: Of course, everyone does. Let the investigation roll first

[Message 22] Chloe: Okay, okay. Just saying, everyone has their issues.

[Message 23] Mark: Anyone else find it weird that the victim was strangled with a rope? It seems so... personal.

[Message 24] Sarah: Everything is weird about the situation.

[Message 25] Chloe: My cousin works near there. Said he saw someone matching Amy's description buying Strangulation with a rope at the store.

[Message 26] Mark: Seriously? A rope? That's... incriminating.

[Message 27] Sarah: She always looked like she had Sloping shoulders

[Message 28] Chloe: But she's got such a weak stature.

[Message 29] Mark: Amy is one cold women.

[Message 31] Chloe: What's done is done. Hope they don't get the death penalty for this.

[Message 53] Chloe: Okay, back to the case. What do we know for sure?

[Message 54] Sarah: 10. Social Worker is dead, murdered at the Public Restroom.

[Message 55] Mark: Mid-Morning. Strangled.

[Message 56] Chloe: Amy might have bought the Strangulation with a rope.

[Message 57] Sarah: Ben was seen near the scene, looking stressed.

[Message 58] Mark: And Amy hated 10. Social Worker.

[Message 59] Chloe: Anyone know if 10. Social Worker had any enemies?

[Message 60] Sarah: I don't know the man.

[Message 61] Mark: No idea. Kept to himself, I heard.

[Message 62] Chloe: Well, this is all so depressing.

[Message 63] Sarah: Agreed.

[Message 64] Mark: Pizza will help.

[Message 65] Chloe: Definitely.

[Message 66] Sarah: Oh, I forgot to tell you guys. Remember that time Ben's motorcycle was stolen?

[Message 67] Mark: What does that have to do with anything, Sarah?

[Message 68] Chloe: Seriously?

[Message 69] Sarah: Just saying, maybe he's got a dark side we don't know about!

[Message 70] Mark: Everyone does. I also thought Ben always hated 10. Social Worker

[Message 71] Chloe: Maybe he intended to do it!

[Message 72] Sarah: Who knows...

[Message 73] Mark: Okay, pizza soon. Gotta go.

[Message 74] Chloe: Me too. See ya.

[Message 75] Sarah: Later!

[Message 76] Amy: Hey guys, heard the news?

[Message 77] Ben: Yeah, messed up.

[Message 78] Amy: I was near the Public Restroom Mid-Morning. Spooky.

[Message 79] Ben: Me too, actually. Weird.

[Message 80] Amy: So glad they got the killer.

[Message 81] Ben: They did? Who was it?

[Message 82] Amy: Haven't you heard? They found some hunchback posture person near the Public Restroom.

[Message 83] Ben: Oh, wow. Glad they caught them so fast.

[Message 84] Amy: Me too. Anyway, how's the motorcycle running, Ben?

[Message 85] Ben: Good as new, thanks for asking, Amy.

[Message 86] Amy: Glad to hear it.

[Message 87] Ben: This whole thing is giving me bad vibes.

[Message 88] Amy: Same. Let's just try to move on.

[Message 89] Ben: Agreed.

[Message 90] Amy: Hey, did you ever find out who took your tools last month?

[Message 91] Ben: No, not yet. Why?

[Message 92] Amy: Just curious.

[Message 93] Ben: Creepy thing is, I was looking up how to make Strangulation with a rope online around that time.

[Message 94] Amy: Haha, dark humor, Ben.

[Message 95] Ben: Wasnt a joke. I purposefully did.

[Message 96] Amy: Should be careful with those, Ben

[Message 97] Ben: I know, just saying. This whole thing is making me paranoid.

[Message 98] Amy: Me too. Anyway, gotta run. Talk later.

[Message 99] Ben: Later, Amy.

[Message 100] Chloe: Guys, I'm freaking out.

[Message 101] Mark: What's wrong, Chloe?

[Message 102] Chloe: My cousin just called. He said he might have misidentified Amy at the store.

[Message 103] Sarah: What?

[Message 104] Mark: So it wasn't her buying the Strangulation with a rope?

[Message 105] Chloe: He's not sure anymore. He said the person had a similar jacket, but...

[Message 106] Sarah: This is getting more confusing by the minute.

[Message 107] Mark: So much for that theory.

[Message 108] Chloe: I feel terrible. We were all so quick to judge.

[Message 109] Sarah: It's okay, Chloe. We were just going off what we heard.

[Message 110] Mark: Still, kinda unsettling that we were all so ready to believe it.

[Message 111] Chloe: True. Okay, new question: who benefits from 10. Social Worker's death?

[Message 112] Sarah: Good question.

[Message 113] Mark: Maybe Ben's motorcycle theft situation is more connected than we think. The timelines line up.

[Message 114] Chloe: Maybe someone who wanted Gaining control of a valuable asset?

[Message 115] Sarah: Someone who wanted to silence a witness?

[Message 116] Mark: We're back to square one.

[Message 117] Chloe: This sucks.

[Message 118] Sarah: Agreed.

[Message 119] Mark: Anyone have any other random details they've been holding back?

[Message 120] Chloe: Not me.

[Message 121] Sarah: Nope. Just that Mrs. Davis' prize-winning roses were stolen last week.

[Message 122] Mark: Seriously, Sarah?

[Message 123] Chloe: You're killing me.

[Message 124] Sarah: Just trying to lighten the mood! Again!

[Message 125] Mark: Maybe we should just leave it to the police.

[Message 126] Chloe: Probably a good idea.

[Message 127] Sarah: Fine, fine. But I still think the roses are suspicious.

[Message 128] Mark: Whatever you say, Sarah.

[Message 129] Chloe: Okay, officially dropping this until the police find something concrete.

[Message 130] Sarah: Deal.",1,

[Message 2] Sam: ""Totally agree, Alex! The ribs are on point. I love to dance – mostly salsa and bachata.""
[Message 3] Jamie: ""Dancing, Sam? That's awesome! I'm more of a stay-at-home kind of person. I enjoy writing.""
[Message 4] Chris: ""Writing? What do you write, Jamie? I'm Chris, by the way.""
[Message 5] Jamie: ""Mostly short stories, Chris. Nice to meet you! What about you?""
[Message 6] Chris: ""I love to travel. Been all over the world. Currently planning a trip to Southeast Asia.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Wow, Chris, that's incredible! I've always wanted to travel more. I mostly sing – karaoke nights are my jam.""
[Message 8] Sam: ""Karaoke! I’m in, Alex! We should all go sometime. Maybe next week?""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Definitely! I’m free most evenings. It'd be fun to have a little get-together outside of this networking event.""
[Message 10] Jamie: ""I might be up for karaoke. I've never actually done it before, but it sounds like a laugh.""
[Message 11] Chris: ""Southeast Asia is amazing. You should definitely go sometime, Alex. The food is incredible.""
[Message 12] Sam: ""Okay, back to hobbies… Chris, where's the best place you've ever traveled?""
[Message 13] Chris: ""That's tough! Probably Japan. The culture is so different, and the food is incredible.""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""Japan is on my list! I'd love to see the temples and gardens.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Me too! I’ve heard their karaoke is next level.""
[Message 16] Sam: ""Ooh, double karaoke! Japan trip + karaoke night here. Making plans!""
[Message 17] Chris: ""Haha, sounds good! Though the karaoke in Japan is... different. Mostly Japanese pop.""
[Message 18] Jamie: ""I'm always up for trying new things. What genre do you usually sing, Alex?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Anything and everything! Pop, rock, country... I'm not picky, though my voice is best suited to pop ballads, haha.""
[Message 20] Sam: ""Ballads, excellent. Need some emotional depth for a good karaoke performance!""
[Message 21] Chris: ""So, Jamie, what kind of stories do you write? Anything we might have read?""
[Message 22] Jamie: ""Mostly just for myself, Chris. I haven't published anything. Maybe someday!""
[Message 23] Alex: ""You should! Writing a book is a huge accomplishment. What are they about?""
[Message 24] Jamie: ""They're mostly fantasy, a bit sci-fi. Escapism, really.""
[Message 25] Sam: ""Fantasy and sci-fi? I love a good fantasy novel! Any recommendations?""
[Message 26] Jamie: ""Oh, so many! But currently, I'm really enjoying 'The Priory of the Orange Tree' by Samantha Shannon.""
[Message 27] Chris: ""I'm more of a non-fiction guy myself. But I appreciate the creativity that goes into fantasy.""
[Message 28] Alex: ""Speaking of creativity, has anyone seen that new art installation downtown?""
[Message 29] Sam: ""Ooh, no! Tell me more, Alex!""
[Message 30] Alex: ""It’s this interactive light display. Apparently, it's really cool at night.""
[Message 31] Chris: ""Might have to check that out. I'm always looking for something new to photograph on my travels... even local ones!""
[Message 32] Jamie: ""That sounds interesting. I might go see it this weekend.""
[Message 33] Sam: ""Weekend art trip, then karaoke next week? We're becoming a social group!""
[Message 34] Alex: ""I’m loving it! Way better than just awkward networking!""
[Message 35] Chris: ""Agreed! This BBQ was a good find.""
[Message 36] Jamie: ""Yeah, this is much more relaxed than the actual event.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Has anyone tried the corn bread? I need a break from the ribs.""
[Message 38] Sam: ""Cornbread is amazing! Definitely try it. It's got a hint of honey.""

[Message 4] Chloe: ""Yeah, that's what I heard. So messed up. I saw River near there this afternoon, acting weird.""
[Message 5] Liam: ""Weird how?""
[Message 6] Chloe: ""I don't know, just… jumpy. And they kept looking around. Also, they didn't say hi, which is unusual.""
[Message 7] Liam: ""River? Really? What time?""
[Message 8] Chloe: ""Around 3 PM, maybe? Something like that. When did it happen to Alex?""
[Message 9] Liam: ""Cops are saying around 2:30 PM. But they aren't sure.""
[Message 10] Chloe: ""Oh. Maybe I'm wrong then.""
[Message 11] Liam: ""Maybe. Just unsettling. I heard Alex denied River's advances a while ago, things got pretty heated, or so I heard.""
[Message 12] Chloe: ""Oof, drama. I had no idea.""

[Message 20] Chloe: ""River! Hey! I'm okay, just… processing everything that happened. How about you?""
[Message 21] River: ""Yeah, it's pretty heavy. I was actually near the Government Building today. Needed to return a book at the library.""
[Message 22] Chloe: ""Oh, okay. What time?""
[Message 23] River: ""Around 3 PM. Why?""
[Message 24] Chloe: ""Just curious. Liam mentioned you were acting a little strange, that's all.""
[Message 25] River: ""Strange? What does that even mean? I was just… preoccupied. I'm always preoccupied! It's my nature""
[Message 26] Chloe: ""I didn't mean anything by it, River. Don't get defensive.""
[Message 27] River: ""Sorry, it's just… this whole thing is making me anxious. Hope they catch whoever did this. Do you know what's the likely punishment for this? ""

[Message 30] Chloe: ""Yeah, just finishing up some stuff. Almost ready.""
[Message 31] Liam: ""Cool. You talk to River? They seem weirded out.""
[Message 32] Chloe: ""Yeah, they said they were at the library. Around 3 PM.""
[Message 33] Liam: ""Hmm. Odd. Library is the opposite direction from where you saw them, right?""
[Message 34] Chloe: ""Yeah, by a few blocks. It's definitely possible they were there, though. I could be wrong about the location.""

[Message 37] River: ""Chloe, listen, I need to tell you something. I was in the Government Building today.""
[Message 38] Chloe: ""What? Why?""
[Message 39] River: ""I… I went to see Alex. I wanted to apologize. I know I said some harsh things.""
[Message 40] Chloe: ""When was this?""
[Message 41] River: ""Around 2 PM. We talked, it didn't go well. I stormed out. I swear I didn't… didn't do anything.""
[Message 42] Chloe: ""Why didn't you tell me this before? That's a pretty big detail to leave out. The intent was clearly there.""
[Message 43] River: ""I was scared! I knew how it would look! I just wanted to tell Alex that I will never be able to move past that rejection. I feel like that triggered this whole situation.""
[Message 44] Chloe: ""You need to tell the police this, River.""
[Message 45] River: ""I can't! They'll think I did it! I was looking up how to get Poisoning via inhalation online just yesterday""
[Message 46] Chloe: ""It will look worse if you don't.""
[Message 47] River: ""Fine, fine. I'll do it tomorrow. I just… I need some time to prepare myself.""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Everything okay? You seem stressed.""
[Message 49] Chloe: ""River just told me they went to see Alex at the Government Building today, around 2 PM. An hour before Alex was found.""
[Message 50] Liam: ""Holy crap! They didn't mention that earlier? ""
[Message 51] Chloe: ""Nope. They said they were scared. They knew they would be the prime suspect. ""
[Message 52] Liam: ""They should definitely tell the police. That's crazy.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""I know, I told them the same thing. They said they'd go tomorrow. I think River's terrified they will face capital punishment.""

[Message 5] Ashley: Me neither. Such a weird thing to happen here.
[Message 6] Casey: You think they'll find out who did it?
[Message 7] Ashley: Eventually, I guess. Mobile PD isn't exactly known for their speed.
[Message 8] Casey: True. Hey, you going to that new bar tonight?
[Message 9] Ashley: Maybe. Depends. Who's going?

[Message 22] Sarah: I know, right? Makes you think.
[Message 23] Denise: Tell me about it. You hear any rumors about who did it?
[Message 24] Sarah: Just that it was some kind of… argument gone wrong?
[Message 25] Denise: That's what I heard too. You think they'll catch them?

[Message 77] Jordan: I doubt it. Unless someone talks.
[Message 78] Taylor: You think someone will?

[Message 80] Taylor: True. Hey, you still have that thing I lent you?
[Message 81] Jordan: Yeah, it's here. Why?
[Message 82] Taylor: Just wondering. I might need it back soon.

[Message 104] Jordan: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 105] Taylor: I'm just… scared.
[Message 106] Jordan: About what? The Taxi Stand thing?
[Message 107] Taylor: Yeah. And… other things.
[Message 108] Jordan: What other things?
[Message 109] Taylor: Never mind. Just… forget I said anything.
[Message 110] Jordan: No, tell me. What's wrong?
[Message 111] Ashley: Casey, I just remembered something. I saw Jordan near the Taxi Stand at Late Morning.
[Message 112] Casey: Really? What was she doing?
[Message 113] Ashley: Just standing there. Seemed like she was waiting for someone.
[Message 114] Casey: Interesting. She didn't mention that to Taylor, did she?
[Message 115] Ashley: I don't think so.
[Message 116] Casey: Maybe she's involved somehow.
[Message 117] Ashley: Maybe. Or maybe it's just a coincidence.
[Message 118] Denise: Sarah, I keep thinking about Maria (Victim 2). She was always so quiet. I remember her saying she was worried about someone exposing a secret of hers.
[Message 119] Sarah: Oh, really? What kind of secret?
[Message 120] Denise: I don't know. She never said. But she seemed really scared.
[Message 121] Sarah: Wow. Maybe that's why she was killed.
[Message 122] Denise: Maybe. It's awful to think about.
[Message 123] Alex: Blake, any news?
[Message 124] Blake: Yeah. I found out who's been talking.
[Message 125] Alex: Who?
[Message 126] Blake: It was the Corrections Officer. (Victim 1). He was going to the cops about your… activities.

[Message 136] Ashley: Casey, I think we should tell the cops what we know.
[Message 137] Casey: Are you crazy? No way!
[Message 138] Ashley: But what if we can help them catch the killer?
[Message 139] Casey: We don't know anything for sure! And we don't want to get involved.
[Message 140] Ashley: But…
[Message 141] Casey: No buts! We stay out of it. Understand? I don’t want them to come looking for us.
[Message 142] Denise: Sarah, I keep having this feeling that something isn't right.
[Message 143] Sarah: What do you mean?
[Message 144] Denise: I don't know. Just… something about the whole situation.
[Message 145] Sarah: Maybe you're just being paranoid.
[Message 146] Denise: Maybe. But I can't shake this feeling that there's more to it than we know. I always thought Maria was aware someone wanted to get rid of her.

[Message 157] Taylor: I know it was you, Jordan. What's going on?
[Message 158] Ashley: Casey, I can't sleep. I keep thinking about those people.
[Message 159] Casey: Try to relax. It's over.
[Message 160] Ashley: But what if it's not? What if the killer strikes again?
[Message 161] Casey: They won't. The cops will catch them.
[Message 162] Ashley: But what if they don't?
[Message 163] Casey: Just try to get some sleep. We'll talk about it in the morning.
[Message 164] Denise: Sarah, I think I know who might have been involved.
[Message 165] Sarah: Who?
[Message 166] Denise: I don't want to say it over text. Can we talk in person?
[Message 167] Sarah: Sure. When?
[Message 168] Denise: How about tomorrow? At the coffee shop?
[Message 169] Sarah: Okay. See you then.

[Message 171] Blake: What? Why?
[Message 172] Alex: Just trust me. It's for your own good.
[Message 173] Blake: Where am I supposed to go?
[Message 174] Alex: I'll tell you later. Just be ready to leave at a moment's notice.
[Message 175] Taylor: Jordan, I'm going to the police.
[Message 176] Jordan: No, Taylor, please don't!
[Message 177] Taylor: I have to. I can't live with this anymore.
[Message 178] Jordan: They're going away for a long time for this. Please! Don't do this to me.
[Message 179] Taylor: I'm sorry, Jordan. I have to do what's right.
[Message 180] Casey: Ashley, you need to calm down. You're overreacting.
[Message 181] Ashley: No, I'm not! I'm scared, Casey!
[Message 182] Casey: There's nothing to be scared of. We're safe.
[Message 183] Ashley: Are we? Are you sure?
[Message 184] Casey: Yes! Now please, just try to relax.
[Message 185] Denise: Sarah, I saw Blake buying Asphyxiation by strangulation rope at the store yesterday morning.
[Message 186] Sarah: What?! Are you serious?
[Message 187] Denise: Yes! I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now…
[Message 188] Sarah: That's insane. We need to tell the cops.
[Message 189] Denise: I know. I'm just… scared.
[Message 190] Alex: Blake, why did Denise see you buying that rope? You were supposed to be careful!
[Message 191] Blake: I didn't know she was there! It's just for… a project.
[Message 192] Alex: What kind of project needs rope?
[Message 193] Blake: A… art project!
[Message 194] Alex: You better hope the cops believe that.

90,"[Message 1] Raj: Hey everyone! Job fair is winding down, I'm starving. Anyone up for grabbing some food after sunset? Maybe do a little shopping afterwards?
[Message 2] Alex: Hey Raj! I'm definitely in for food. Shopping depends on how my feet are feeling after all this walking.
[Message 3] Chris: Sounds good to me, Raj. I need some new socks, so shopping's a must. What kind of food are we thinking?
[Message 4] Raj: I'm open to suggestions! Maybe that Italian place we saw on the way in?
[Message 5] Alex: Italian sounds great! They have good vegetarian options, right?
[Message 6] Chris: I think so, Alex. I remember seeing pasta primavera on the menu outside.
[Message 7] Raj: Perfect! Let's head there after this last presentation.
[Message 8] Alex: Sounds like a plan. This presentation is dragging on...
[Message 9] Chris: Tell me about it! I'm starting to daydream about that pasta.
[Message 10] Raj: Haha, same here! Maybe we can look at shoes while we shop? I need new work boots.
[Message 11] Alex: Ooh, good idea, Raj. I've been meaning to get some new walking shoes.
[Message 12] Chris: I'm good on shoes, but I could use a new belt.
[Message 13] Raj: A belt, shoes, and socks - we're hitting all the essential clothing categories!
[Message 14] Alex: Exactly! Practical shopping at its finest.
[Message 15] Chris: Keeps it simple. Easier to find what you need.
[Message 16] Raj: Agreed. Less overwhelming that way.
[Message 17] Alex: Speaking of overwhelming, how was everyone's experience at the job fair?
[Message 18] Chris: It was okay. A lot of the positions weren't really a good fit for me.
[Message 19] Raj: Yeah, I felt the same way. Some interesting companies, though.
[Message 20] Alex: I found a couple of promising leads. Fingers crossed!
[Message 21] Raj: Good luck, Alex! I hope you hear back from them.
[Message 22] Chris: Me too! Rooting for you.
[Message 23] Alex: Thanks, guys! Appreciate it.
[Message 24] Raj: No problem! We gotta support each other.
[Message 25] Chris: Definitely. That's what friends are for.
[Message 26] Alex: So, back to shopping... any particular stores you guys have in mind?
[Message 27] Raj: Not really. I'm just looking for a good work boot store.
[Message 28] Chris: I usually just hit up the department store for socks and belts.
[Message 29] Alex: There's a decent shoe store near the Italian place, I think.
[Message 30] Raj: Perfect! That works for me.
[Message 31] Chris: Sounds like a solid plan.
[Message 32] Alex: Okay, presentation's finally ending! Freedom!
[Message 33] Raj: Hallelujah! Let's get some pasta!
[Message 34] Chris: Lead the way!
[Message 35] Raj: Alright, Italian restaurant first, then shopping. Let's go!
[Message 36] Alex: Onward to carbs and consumerism!
[Message 37] Chris: Haha, couldn't have said it better myself.
[Message 38] Raj: So, has anyone seen any good movies lately? Trying to catch something new.
[Message 39] Alex: I watched that documentary about bees last week. It was surprisingly interesting!
[Message 40] Chris: Oh really? I'm not usually into documentaries, but bees sound intriguing.
[Message 41] Raj: Bees, huh? I might have to check that out.
[Message 42] Alex: It's called ""Honeyland."" Give it a try!
[Message 43] Chris: Will do! Thanks for the recommendation.
[Message 44] Raj: What about you, Chris? Seen anything good?
[Message 45] Chris: Actually, I’ve been rereading some old classics lately. Just finished ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""
[Message 46] Alex: A classic for a reason! Still holds up.
[Message 47] Raj: Definitely. I should reread that one sometime.
[Message 48] Alex: Okay, we're at the Italian place. Smells amazing!
[Message 49] Chris: I'm already drooling.
[Message 50] Raj: Let's get a table!
[Message 51] Alex: I'll grab a table. You guys order drinks?
[Message 52] Chris: Sounds good. I'll have a water.
[Message 53] Raj: I'll take a Coke.

[Message 55] Raj: Thanks, Alex!
[Message 56] Chris: Much appreciated!
[Message 57] Alex: No problem, team work!
[Message 58] Raj: Alright, table's ready. Let's dig in.
[Message 59] Chris: Pasta, here I come!
[Message 60] Alex: Mmm, this bread is delicious!
[Message 61] Raj: This place is pretty good.
[Message 62] Alex: I'm happy with the vegetarian options. The pasta primavera is great.
[Message 63] Chris: I got the lasagna. It's amazing.
[Message 64] Raj: I went with the spaghetti and meatballs. Classic.
[Message 65] Alex: Can't go wrong with that!
[Message 66] Chris: So, after shopping, anyone up for grabbing coffee?
[Message 67] Raj: I could use a caffeine boost.
[Message 68] Alex: I'm always up for coffee!
[Message 69] Raj: Okay, coffee after shopping it is!
[Message 70] Chris: Excellent!
[Message 71] Alex: This pasta is hitting the spot. Feeling much better after that job fair.
[Message 72] Raj: Me too! Good food always helps.
[Message 73] Chris: Agreed. Food is the best medicine.
[Message 74] Alex: So true. Especially Italian food.
[Message 75] Raj: Definitely one of my favorites.
[Message 76] Chris: Mine too. Comfort food at its finest.
[Message 77] Alex: Are we all ready to start thinking about shopping plans now?
[Message 78] Raj: Yeah, I think so. Boots are my priority.
[Message 79] Chris: Socks and belts for me. Quick and easy.
[Message 80] Alex: Shoes for me, but I'm not in a huge rush.
[Message 81] Raj: Okay, boots first, then the department store, then shoes?
[Message 82] Chris: Sounds good to me.
[Message 83] Alex: Works for me too!
[Message 84] Raj: Perfect! Organized shopping is the best shopping.
[Message 85] Chris: Absolutely. Minimizes stress.
[Message 86] Alex: Agreed!
[Message 87] Raj: Anyone have any exciting plans for the weekend?
[Message 88] Alex: I'm planning on doing some gardening.
[Message 89] Chris: Oh, that sounds nice and relaxing!
[Message 90] Raj: Gardening? That's cool!
[Message 91] Alex: Yeah, I'm trying to grow some tomatoes and herbs.
[Message 92] Chris: That's awesome! Fresh herbs are the best.
[Message 93] Raj: What about you, Chris? Anything fun planned?
[Message 94] Chris: Just relaxing at home and catching up on some reading.
[Message 95] Alex: Sounds peaceful!
[Message 96] Raj: What kind of books are you reading?
[Message 97] Chris: Right now I'm reading a biography of Benjamin Franklin.
[Message 98] Alex: Interesting! He was quite the character.
[Message 99] Raj: Definitely a fascinating figure.
[Message 100] Alex: And you, Raj? Any weekend plans?
[Message 101] Raj: I'm hoping to get some sculpting done.
[Message 102] Chris: Oh, that's cool! What are you working on?
[Message 103] Alex: Yeah, I'd love to hear about your sculptures!
[Message 104] Raj: I'm working on a small bust of my dog.
[Message 105] Chris: That's so sweet!
[Message 106] Alex: Aww, I bet it'll be adorable!
[Message 107] Raj: I hope so! It's a challenge capturing his likeness.

[Message 115] Raj: Boots first, remember?
[Message 116] Alex: Lead the way to the shoe store!
[Message 117] Chris: Onward!
[Message 118] Raj: Okay, I think it's just a couple blocks down.
[Message 119] Alex: Perfect. A nice little walk after all that pasta.
[Message 120] Chris: Good for digestion!
[Message 121] Raj: Exactly! Let's go!
[Message 122] Alex: Anyone have a specific style of boot in mind, Raj?
[Message 123] Raj: I need something sturdy and waterproof. I'm thinking steel-toed.
[Message 124] Chris: Safety first!
[Message 125] Alex: Definitely important for your job.
[Message 126] Raj: Yup! Gotta protect my feet.
[Message 127] Chris: Makes sense.
[Message 128] Alex: What kind of walking shoes are you looking for, Alex?
[Message 129] Alex: Something comfortable and supportive. I'm not too picky about style.
[Message 130] Raj: Function over fashion!
[Message 131] Chris: Practicality is key.

[Message 15] Maya: ""Alex? Wow, I knew him. Always kept to himself.""
[Message 16] David: ""A cop and a manager? Sounds like a drug deal gone wrong, honestly.""
[Message 17] Chloe: ""David! That's insensitive.""
[Message 18] David: ""Just saying what everyone's thinking.""
[Message 19] Liam: ""I need to start going somewhere else. First this, then my car getting broken into.""
[Message 20] Maya: ""Seriously? When did that happen, Liam?""
[Message 21] Liam: ""Last week. Just smashed the window and grabbed my GPS. Annoying.""
[Message 22] Chloe: ""That sucks, Liam. Maybe you should get a security system.""
[Message 23] David: ""Or a gun.""
[Message 24] Maya: ""David, stop.""
[Message 25] Liam: ""Anyway, anyone up for pizza tonight? Distract ourselves from all this.""
[Message 26] Chloe: ""Sounds good to me. I'm in.""
[Message 27] Maya: ""I can't tonight, have to work late. But thanks for the invite.""
[Message 28] David: ""Count me in for pizza. I'm starving.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Cool, so David and Chloe. I'll book a table.""
[Message 30] Maya: ""Have fun, guys. Be safe.""
[Message 31] Chloe: ""We will. You too, Maya.""
[Message 32] David: ""Yeah, later Maya.""
[Message 33] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 34] Chloe: ""So, David, what do you think really happened at Factory?""
[Message 35] David: ""Like I said, drug deal gone south. Alex was probably involved.""
[Message 36] Chloe: ""But a cop too? That’s weird.""
[Message 37] David: ""Maybe Alex was ratting people out. Cops don't just show up at a place like Factory for no reason.""
[Message 38] Chloe: ""True. It's all so messed up.""
[Message 39] David: ""You seem pretty shaken up, Chloe.""
[Message 40] Chloe: ""I just... I don't like violence. It scares me.""
[Message 41] David: ""Understandable. Me neither. Which is why you gotta be prepared to defend yourself, you know?""
[Message 42] Chloe: ""I guess so.""
[Message 43] Liam: ""Table's booked for 8. See you guys there.""
[Message 44] Chloe: ""Great! See you then.""
[Message 45] David: ""Alright, Liam.""
[Message 46] Maya: ""Hey Liam, quick question. Did Danny seem… angry or anything when you saw him?""
[Message 47] Liam: ""Nah, just his usual stressed self. Why?""
[Message 48] Maya: ""Just curious. Never mind.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""Okay... Everything alright, Maya?""
[Message 50] Maya: ""Yeah, just a long day. Thanks.""
[Message 51] Liam: ""No problem. See you later.""
[Message 52] Maya: ""Bye.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""Hey Liam, something's bugging me.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""What's up, Chloe?""
[Message 55] Chloe: ""David said he never liked Danny. He seems almost… happy about this whole thing.""
[Message 56] Liam: ""David's always been a bit of a hardass. Don't read too much into it.""
[Message 57] Chloe: ""Maybe you're right.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Besides, what could David possibly have to do with any of this?""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""I don't know. It's just a feeling.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Look, let's just try to have a good time tonight, okay? Forget about all this for a few hours.""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""Okay. You're right.""
[Message 62] David: ""Hey Maya, you heading home soon?""
[Message 63] Maya: ""Yeah, about to leave. Why?""
[Message 64] David: ""Just wondering if you needed a ride. It's not safe out there these days.""
[Message 65] Maya: ""Thanks, David, but I'm good. I have my pepper spray.""
[Message 66] David: ""Alright. Just be careful.""
[Message 67] Maya: ""Always am. You too.""
[Message 68] David: ""Later.""
[Message 69] Maya: ""Later.""
[Message 70] Chloe: ""Pizza was good, Liam. Thanks.""
[Message 71] Liam: ""No problem. Glad you enjoyed it.""
[Message 72] David: ""Yeah, appreciate it, man.""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Heard anything more about the Factory murders?""
[Message 74] Liam: ""Just the same stuff on the news. No suspects yet, apparently.""
[Message 75] David: ""They'll find whoever did it. They always do.""
[Message 76] Chloe: ""Hope so. It's scary thinking someone like that is out there.""
[Message 77] Liam: ""Speaking of scary, you guys see that horror movie trailer?""
[Message 78] David: ""Nah, what's it about?""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Some killer clown terrorizing a small town.""
[Message 80] Chloe: ""Sounds awful! I hate clowns.""
[Message 81] David: ""I'd watch it. Love a good scare.""
[Message 82] Liam: ""Maybe we can all go next week?""
[Message 83] Chloe: ""I'll pass. I’ll stick to rom-coms.""
[Message 84] David: ""Suit yourself. More popcorn for me.""
[Message 85] Maya: ""Hey guys, heard anything new about the case?""
[Message 86] Liam: ""Nothing. Still a mystery.""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""Nope. Just the same old news reports.""
[Message 88] David: ""Silence usually means they're onto something. They're probably building a case.""
[Message 89] Maya: ""Hope so. This is unsettling.""
[Message 90] Liam: ""Did you hear the manager, Alex, had debts?""
[Message 91] Chloe: ""No way! Where'd you hear that?""
[Message 92] Liam: ""Someone at the gym was talking about it. Said he owed some serious people money.""
[Message 93] David: ""See? Told you it was a deal gone wrong.""
[Message 94] Maya: ""That doesn't mean he deserved to die.""
[Message 95] Liam: ""Of course not. Just saying it adds up.""
[Message 96] Chloe: ""Still, it's awful.""
[Message 97] David: ""Life's awful. Get used to it.""
[Message 98] Maya: ""You okay, David? You seem extra cynical lately.""
[Message 99] David: ""Just tired of all the fake sympathy. People die. It happens.""
[Message 100] Maya: ""There's a difference between accepting death and being completely callous about it.""
[Message 101] David: ""Whatever, Maya. You always overthink things.""
[Message 102] Liam: ""Alright guys, let's not argue. We're all stressed out.""
[Message 103] Chloe: ""Yeah, let's just drop it.""
[Message 104] Maya: ""Fine.""
[Message 105] David: ""Good.""
[Message 106] Liam: ""Anyone need anything? I'm heading to the store.""
[Message 107] Chloe: ""Can you grab me some chocolate, please?""
[Message 108] Liam: ""Sure. Anything else?""
[Message 109] Chloe: ""Nope, that's it. Thanks, Liam.""
[Message 110] David: ""I'm good.""
[Message 111] Maya: ""No, thanks.""
[Message 112] Liam: ""Alright, be back in a bit.""
[Message 113] Chloe: ""Okay, bye.""
[Message 114] David: ""Later.""
[Message 115] Maya: ""Bye Liam.""
[Message 116] Maya: ""Chloe, can I ask you something privately?""
[Message 117] Chloe: ""Sure, what's up, Maya?""
[Message 118] Maya: ""Do you think David could be involved somehow? It's just a feeling I have.""
[Message 119] Chloe: ""I had that feeling too, at first. But Liam said we're overreacting.""
[Message 120] Maya: ""Maybe. But his reaction to the whole thing seems off. And that comment about needing to defend yourself...""
[Message 121] Chloe: ""I know, it was weird. But he's always been into that survivalist stuff.""
[Message 122] Maya: ""True. But still… keep an eye on him, okay?""
[Message 123] Chloe: ""I will. You too.""
[Message 124] Maya: ""Thanks, Chloe.""
[Message 125] Chloe: ""No problem. We gotta look out for each other.""
[Message 126] David: ""Hey, anyone seen my Using a garrote?""
[Message 127] Liam: ""Using a garrote? Why do you have one of those?""
[Message 128] David: ""Collecting old army gear. Just wondering where I put it.""
[Message 129] Chloe: ""That's... concerning, David.""
[Message 130] Maya: ""Yeah, maybe you should stick to collecting stamps.""
[Message 131] David: ""Relax, it's just a hobby.""
[Message 132] Liam: ""Well, try not to scare us, okay?""
[Message 133] David: ""Whatever.""
[Message 134] Maya: ""Have the police questioned any of you yet?""
[Message 135] Liam: ""Not me. I told you, I just picked up a package.""
[Message 136] Chloe: ""Not me either. I was at work all day.""
[Message 137] David: ""They talked to me for a bit. Just routine questions.""
[Message 138] Maya: ""What did they ask?""
[Message 139] David: ""Where I was, who I knew, the usual.""
[Message 140] Maya: ""Did you tell them about Danny?""
[Message 141] David: ""Yeah, I mentioned seeing him around.""

[Message 147] Liam: ""Life in prison, probably. Maybe the death penalty.""

[Message 149] David: ""They should bring back public executions. That would deter crime.""

[Message 2] Jordan: Hey Alex! Always. Especially for this caffeine jolt at dawn. And for my comfy bed.

[Message 3] Sam: Morning! Gratitude is a good way to start the day. I'm thankful for my students, even the challenging ones.

[Message 4] River: Morning! I'm grateful for finally figuring out that tricky level in my game last night. Felt like a real accomplishment. Also, strong coffee.

[Message 5] Chris: Morning, folks. I'm grateful for a productive week at work. Especially after that difficult feedback I had to give Sarah.

[Message 6] Alex: Giving feedback is tough, Chris. I'm grateful for colleagues who are open to it. Makes the process so much smoother.

[Message 7] Jordan: Agreed, Alex. Constructive feedback is a gift, even if it doesn't feel like it at the time. What kind of feedback was it, Chris? (If you don't mind sharing, of course!)

[Message 8] Chris: Just some performance-related stuff, Jordan. Nothing earth-shattering. More about workflow efficiency.

[Message 9] River: Speaking of efficiency, I'm grateful for online tutorials. They've saved me hours of frustration.

[Message 10] Sam: Totally, River! I'm grateful for the internet in general. So much knowledge at our fingertips.

[Message 11] Alex: I'm grateful for my garden. It's my little escape from the world. Anyone else have a hobby they're thankful for?

[Message 12] Jordan: I'm thankful for my budget spreadsheet. Sounds boring, but it gives me peace of mind. And lets me save for fun things!

[Message 13] Sam: My gratitude goes to a good book and a quiet evening. Recharge central.

[Message 14] River: Definitely grateful for gaming as an outlet. Keeps me sane! Anyone playing anything good lately?

[Message 15] Chris: I'm grateful for the chance to play a little softball with the guys this weekend. Gotta stay active!

[Message 16] Alex: Softball sounds fun, Chris! I’m more of a spectator these days.

[Message 17] Jordan: I'm thankful for the sunshine we're supposed to have today. Boosts my mood instantly.

[Message 18] Sam: I'm grateful that it's Friday. End of the work week! Time to relax.

[Message 19] River: Right?! Friday feeling is strong! I’m also grateful for coffee shops that open this early.

[Message 20] Chris: Grateful for supportive friends and family. Can't do life without them.

[Message 21] Alex: Hear, hear, Chris. Community is everything. Anyone have any plans for the weekend related to gratitude? Volunteer work, maybe?

[Message 22] Jordan: I was thinking of donating to a local charity. Small gesture, but it feels good.

[Message 23] Sam: I might write some thank you notes to former teachers. They made a huge impact on my life.

[Message 24] River: That's a great idea, Sam! I might do the same for some mentors I've had.

[Message 25] Chris: Good thinking everyone. I'm just grateful for this conversation and the reminder to appreciate the small things. Have a great day, all",0,

[Message 16] Emily: ""I saw Tom arguing with 10. Social Worker last week. Looked heated.""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Really? What was it about?""
[Message 18] Chloe: ""Probably just Flea Market stuff.""

[Message 28] River: ""I was thinking of helping out at the animal shelter. They're always looking for people to walk the dogs.""
[Message 29] Jamie: ""That's so nice of you, River! I wish I had more time for that.""
[Message 30] Alex: ""I'm helping out at the soup kitchen downtown. They're expecting a busy weekend.""
[Message 31] Jamie: ""Wow, you guys are both amazing. I'm just... writing marketing copy.""
[Message 32] River: ""Hey, marketing is important too! You're helping businesses thrive.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Exactly! It all contributes. Don't downplay your work, Jamie.""
[Message 34] Jamie: ""Thanks, guys. I appreciate that.""
[Message 35] River: ""So, Bella Notte. Any particular dishes you're eyeing, Alex?""
[Message 36] Alex: ""That Osso Buco looked pretty tempting.""
[Message 37] Jamie: ""Ooh, good choice. I'm thinking maybe the pasta carbonara. Classic.""
[Message 38] River: ""I'm always a sucker for a good lasagna.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""We'll have to share! That way we can try everything.""
[Message 40] Jamie: ""Definitely! Food sharing is mandatory.""
[Message 41] River: ""Agreed. It's the only way to truly experience a menu.""
[Message 42] Alex: ""Okay, reservation at Bella Notte for Wednesday at 7pm. Three people. Pasta sharing encouraged.""
[Message 43] Jamie: ""Perfect! You're on it, Alex.""
[Message 44] River: ""Thanks, Alex! You're a star.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""No problem, guys. Just happy to have dinner plans.""
[Message 46] Jamie: ""Me too! I've been needing a night out.""
[Message 47] River: ""Same here. It's been a busy week.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""Anything exciting happening, River?""
[Message 49] River: ""Just a lot of showings. The market is still crazy.""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""I can imagine! I hear houses are selling in like, a day.""
[Message 51] River: ""Pretty much! It's wild. Good for sellers, tough for buyers.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Yeah, I've heard some horror stories.""
[Message 53] Jamie: ""Speaking of horror stories, did you guys see that new horror movie that came out?""
[Message 54] River: ""Oh, which one?""
[Message 55] Jamie: ""The one with the creepy dolls. I can't remember the exact title.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""I'm not a big horror fan, personally.""
[Message 57] River: ""Me neither. I prefer something a bit more… gentle.""
[Message 58] Jamie: ""Fair enough. More lasagna, less creepy dolls.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Exactly!""
[Message 60] River: ""So, lasagna at Bella Notte. Are we thinking red sauce or white sauce?""
[Message 61] Jamie: ""Ooh, good question. I'm partial to a creamy white sauce lasagna.""
[Message 62] Alex: ""Me too! But a good red sauce can be amazing as well.""
[Message 63] River: ""We'll have to check the menu and see what they offer.""
[Message 64] Jamie: ""Sounds like a plan! I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Me too. I might need to raid the fridge when I get home.""
[Message 66] River: ""I have some leftover soup. Perfect for a chilly evening.""
[Message 67] Jamie: ""Soup sounds amazing! What kind?""
[Message 68] River: ""Tomato and basil. Classic comfort food.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Perfect! That sounds delicious.""
[Message 70] Jamie: ""Okay, I'm officially craving soup now. And lasagna. And risotto.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""And Osso Buco!""
[Message 72] River: ""We're going to have to roll ourselves out of that restaurant.""
[Message 73] Jamie: ""Worth it! No regrets.""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Absolutely no regrets.""
[Message 75] River: ""So, are we all set for Wednesday then?""
[Message 76] Jamie: ""Yep! Wednesday at 7pm at Bella Notte.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Confirmed! I'll text you guys the reservation details later.""
[Message 78] River: ""Great! Thanks, Alex.""
[Message 79] Jamie: ""Thanks again, Alex! You're a lifesaver.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Anytime, guys! Looking forward to it.""
[Message 81] River: ""Me too! It'll be nice to catch up.""
[Message 82] Jamie: ""Definitely. And talk about something other than marketing strategies for once.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Or recipes. Although, I could always use some new ideas.""
[Message 84] River: ""I have a great recipe for apple pie. Perfect for fall.""
[Message 85] Jamie: ""Ooh, apple pie! Yes, please!""
[Message 86] Alex: ""I'm always up for apple pie. Especially homemade.""
[Message 87] River: ""I'll have to bake one and bring it in sometime.""
[Message 88] Jamie: ""That would be amazing, River! You're the best baker I know.""
[Message 89] Alex: ""Agreed! Your baking is legendary.""
[Message 90] River: ""Aw, you guys are too kind. I just enjoy it.""
[Message 91] Jamie: ""Well, we certainly enjoy the results of your enjoyment!""
[Message 92] Alex: ""Speaking of results, how's that sourdough starter doing, Jamie?""
[Message 93] Jamie: ""Ugh, don't even ask. It's being temperamental. I think I need to feed it more often.""
[Message 94] River: ""Sourdough can be tricky. But so rewarding when it works!""
[Message 95] Alex: ""Patience is key. And good flour.""
[Message 96] Jamie: ""I'm lacking both of those things right now. But I'll keep trying!""
[Message 97] River: ""You'll get there! We believe in you.""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Definitely! Sourdough success is within your reach.""
[Message 99] Jamie: ""Thanks, guys! I appreciate the encouragement.""
[Message 100] River: ""So, Wednesday. What are we wearing to Bella Notte?""
[Message 101] Jamie: ""Good question! I was thinking something casual but nice.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""Same here. Jeans and a nice top?""
[Message 103] River: ""Sounds perfect! Comfortable and presentable.""
[Message 104] Jamie: ""Exactly! No need to get too fancy.""
[Message 105] Alex: ""Unless you want to, River. You always look amazing.""
[Message 106] River: ""Aw, thanks, Alex! I just like to be comfortable.""
[Message 107] Jamie: ""Comfort is key! Especially when eating large amounts of lasagna.""
[Message 108] Alex: ""True that!""
[Message 109] River: ""Okay, casual it is then. Jeans and a nice top for all of us.""
[Message 110] Jamie: ""Sounds like a plan! We'll be a stylish trio.""
[Message 111] Alex: ""Absolutely! Ready to conquer Bella Notte.""
[Message 112] River: ""Ready to conquer some delicious Italian food!""
[Message 113] Jamie: ""Okay, I think we've thoroughly planned this dinner. I'm excited!""
[Message 114] Alex: ""Me too! It'll be a great night.""
[Message 115] River: ""Agreed! I'm looking forward to it.""
[Message 116] Jamie: ""Alright, I should probably get back to work. Marketing calls!""
[Message 117] Alex: ""Good luck! May your calls be fruitful.""
[Message 118] River: ""Break a leg, Jamie!""
[Message 119] Jamie: ""Thanks, guys! Talk to you later!""
[Message 120] Alex: ""See ya!""
[Message 121] River: ""Bye, Jamie!""
[Message 122] Alex: ""So, River, anything else exciting happening in the real estate world?""
[Message 123] River: ""Just the usual craziness. Trying to keep up with the demand.""
[Message 124] Alex: ""I can imagine. Must be exhausting.""
[Message 125] River: ""It is, but it's also rewarding when I help someone find their dream home.""
[Message 126] Alex: ""That's a good point. Making a difference in people's lives.""
[Message 127] River: ""Exactly! That's what keeps me going.""
[Message 128] Alex: ""Well, you're doing a great job! I hear good things about you all the time.""
[Message 129] River: ""Aw, thanks, Alex! I appreciate that.""
[Message 130] Alex: ""Anytime! It's the truth.""
[Message 131] River: ""Well, I should probably get back to work too. Showings to schedule!""
[Message 132] Alex: ""Okay, good luck with that!""
[Message 133] River: ""Thanks! Talk to you later!""
[Message 134] Alex: ""See ya!""
[Message 135] River: ""Bye!""
[Message 136] Alex: ""Now, back to thinking about that Osso Buco...""
[Message 137] Alex: ""I wonder if they have a good wine list.""
[Message 138] Alex: ""Probably should check that out before Wednesday.""
[Message 139] Alex: ""Maybe a nice Chianti would go well with the Osso Buco.""
[Message 140] Alex: ""Or a Barolo. Decisions, decisions.""
[Message 141] Alex: ""Guess I'll have to do some research.""
[Message 142] Alex: ""Maybe I'll just ask the sommelier when we get there.""
[Message 143] Alex: ""That's probably the easiest option.""
[Message 144] Alex: ""Less thinking, more eating. That's the motto for Wednesday.""
[Message 145] Alex: ""Alright, time to get back to work myself. Need to prep for the weekend rush.""
[Message 146] Alex: ""Hopefully, it won't be too crazy.""
[Message 147] Alex: ""But hey, at least I have Bella Notte to look forward to.""
[Message 148] Alex: ""And apple pie... eventually.""
[Message 149] Alex: ""Okay, focus, Alex. Back to the kitchen!""
[Message 150] Alex: ""Time to create some culinary magic.""
[Message 151] Alex: ""Hopefully, my ancient grain bread turns out well this time.""
[Message 152] Alex: ""It's a finicky recipe, but so worth it when it's right.""
[Message 153] Alex: ""Alright, enough daydreaming. Let's do this!""
[Message 154] Alex: ""Time to channel my inner chef.""
[Message 155] Alex: ""And maybe sneak a taste of that tomato soup River mentioned...""
[Message 156] Alex: ""Okay, no more distractions! Back to work!""
[Message 157] Alex: ""Just gotta get through today. Wednesday will be here before I know it.""
[Message 158] Alex: ""And then... Italian food heaven.""
[Message 159] Alex: ""Alright, enough dreaming. Time to get cooking!""
[Message 160] Alex: ""Let the culinary adventures begin!""
[Message 161] Alex: ""Hopefully, Bella Notte is as good as it sounds.""
[Message 162] Alex: ""I'm cautiously optimistic.""
[Message 163] Alex: ""But with good company and good food, what could go wrong?""
[Message 164] Alex: ""Okay, seriously, back to work now!""
[Message 165] Alex: ""Wednesday can't come soon enough!""",0,
96,"[Message 1] CHLOE: ""Hey guys, heard about what happened at the gym?""
[Message 2] LIAM: ""Yeah, insane. Two people dead.""
[Message 3] AVA: ""I know, right? Makes you wonder if you're safe anywhere.""
[Message 4] CHLOE: ""Who were they?""
[Message 5] LIAM: ""I think one was a judge... someone named Morgan. The other, a journalist. Riley something?""
[Message 6] AVA: ""Riley… yeah, Riley Thompson. I saw her there a few times.""
[Message 7] CHLOE: ""Ugh, I hate Greenville sometimes. This always happens in small towns.""
[Message 8] LIAM: ""True. Small town, big secrets, I guess.""
[Message 9] AVA: ""Did they say how it happened?""
[Message 10] CHLOE: ""Impalement with a sharp object, apparently. Brutal.""
[Message 11] LIAM: ""Damn. That's… personal.""
[Message 12] AVA: ""Personal? What do you mean?""
[Message 13] LIAM: ""Just seems like a crime of passion, you know? Not some random robbery.""
[Message 14] CHLOE: ""Maybe. Or maybe someone just wanted to make it look that way.""
[Message 15] AVA: ""Wow Chloe, dark thoughts.""
[Message 16] CHLOE: ""Just saying, don't rule anything out.""
[Message 17] LIAM: ""I was at the gym yesterday afternoon, but I left before Sunset.""
[Message 18] AVA: ""Me too, around 4 pm. Couldn't stand the leg day.""
[Message 19] CHLOE: ""I haven’t been in weeks. Too busy with school.""
[Message 20] LIAM: ""Speaking of, you ready for that history test?""
[Message 21] CHLOE: ""Not even close. Distracted.""
[Message 22] AVA: ""Me neither. This whole thing is throwing me off.""
[Message 23] LIAM: ""Yeah, it's messed up.""
[Message 24] CHLOE: ""Anyone know anything about Morgan or Riley?""
[Message 25] AVA: ""Just that Morgan was a judge. Seemed kinda withdrawn, never really talked to anyone.""
[Message 26] LIAM: ""Riley was always digging for a story, that’s for sure. Ambitious.""
[Message 27] CHLOE: ""Maybe she dug too deep.""
[Message 28] AVA: ""You think she was working on something dangerous?""
[Message 29] CHLOE: ""Could be. Journalists make enemies. The person who did this intended for her to suffer""
[Message 30] LIAM: ""I guess. Still, crazy to think someone would do that.""
[Message 31] AVA: ""My mom said the cops are all over it.""
[Message 32] CHLOE: ""Good. They need to catch whoever did this.""
[Message 33] LIAM: ""For real. Justice for Morgan and Riley.""
[Message 34] AVA: ""Absolutely.""
[Message 35] CHLOE: ""What's everyone doing tonight? Wanna distract ourselves?""
[Message 36] LIAM: ""Movie night at my place? We can order pizza.""
[Message 37] AVA: ""Sounds good. Need something to take my mind off this.""
[Message 38] CHLOE: ""Count me in. Anything but true crime, please.""
[Message 39] LIAM: ""Haha, deal.""
[Message 40] AVA: ""See you guys later.""
[Message 41] CHLOE: ""Later.""
[Message 42] LIAM: ""Later.""
[Message 43] CHLOE: ""Hey Liam, did you hear anything else about the… you know?""
[Message 44] LIAM: ""Not really. Just the basics they're reporting. Why?""
[Message 45] CHLOE: ""Just curious. Seemed like you had some insight earlier.""
[Message 46] LIAM: ""Nah, just speculating. It’s a horrible crime.""
[Message 47] AVA: ""Hey, sorry I bailed last night. Something came up.""
[Message 48] CHLOE: ""No worries, everything okay?""
[Message 49] AVA: ""Yeah, just family stuff. Nothing serious.""
[Message 50] LIAM: ""Hope everything's alright, Ava.""
[Message 51] AVA: ""Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.""
[Message 52] CHLOE: ""So, anything new on the case?""
[Message 53] LIAM: ""Nothing that I've heard. The news is all the same.""
[Message 54] AVA: ""My neighbor said they saw someone suspicious leaving the gym around Sunset, but they couldn't describe them.""
[Message 55] CHLOE: ""Suspicious how?""
[Message 56] AVA: ""Just… acting weird. Rushing, looking around nervously.""
[Message 57] LIAM: ""Could be anyone after what happened.""
[Message 58] CHLOE: ""True. Everyone's on edge.""
[Message 59] AVA: ""I'm going to start carrying pepper spray, I think.""
[Message 60] LIAM: ""Not a bad idea.""
[Message 61] CHLOE: ""Me too. Better safe than sorry.""
[Message 62] LIAM: ""I saw Riley buying Impalement with a sharp object last week. Figured she was prepping for a story.""
[Message 63] AVA: ""Really? Where?""
[Message 64] LIAM: ""Ace Hardware. I was picking up some stuff for my garden.""
[Message 65] CHLOE: ""That's… interesting.""
[Message 66] AVA: ""Yeah, maybe she found something and felt threatened.""
[Message 67] LIAM: ""Could be. Or maybe it's nothing.""
[Message 68] CHLOE: ""You think they'll ever find out who did it?""
[Message 69] AVA: ""I hope so. For Morgan and Riley’s families.""
[Message 70] LIAM: ""Me too. They deserve justice. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 71] CHLOE: ""This whole thing is making me sick to my stomach.""
[Message 72] AVA: ""I know. I can't even sleep.""
[Message 73] LIAM: ""Let's try to focus on something else, guys. We're just stressing ourselves out.""
[Message 74] CHLOE: ""Easier said than done.""
[Message 75] AVA: ""True. But worth a shot.""
[Message 76] LIAM: ""Anyone got any fun plans for the weekend?""
[Message 77] CHLOE: ""Thinking of going hiking. Need some fresh air.""
[Message 78] AVA: ""That sounds nice. I might join you.""
[Message 79] LIAM: ""I'm probably just gonna chill at home. Need to catch up on sleep.""
[Message 80] CHLOE: ""Sounds relaxing.""
[Message 81] AVA: ""Definitely.""
[Message 82] CHLOE: ""Ava, did you know Morgan at all?""
[Message 83] AVA: ""Not really. Just saw her around the gym. Never spoke to her.""
[Message 84] CHLOE: ""Okay. Just wondering.""
[Message 85] LIAM: ""Why? What's up?""
[Message 86] CHLOE: ""No reason. Just trying to piece things together in my head.""
[Message 87] AVA: ""It's okay to grieve, Chloe. It affects us all.""
[Message 88] CHLOE: ""Grieve? Im not grieving""
[Message 89] LIAM: ""She's just upset like the rest of us""
[Message 90] AVA: ""My bad, just was trying to make you feel comfortable.""
[Message 91] CHLOE: ""Yeah...""
[Message 92] LIAM: ""Chloe I think you should visit the detective""
[Message 93] CHLOE: ""I don't need to visit the detective.""
[Message 94] LIAM: ""Okay.""
[Message 95] AVA: ""Hey guys, I was thinking about the neighbor who saw someone leaving... They said the person was wearing all black.""
[Message 96] CHLOE: ""Lots of people wear all black to the gym.""
[Message 97] LIAM: ""True. Not much to go on.""
[Message 98] AVA: ""Yeah, but still… worth mentioning.""
[Message 99] CHLOE: ""Definitely. Every detail counts.""
[Message 100] LIAM: ""The cops are probably already on it.""
[Message 101] AVA: ""Hopefully.""
[Message 102] CHLOE: ""Anyone know if Morgan had any enemies?""
[Message 103] LIAM: ""Being a judge, probably. You make decisions, people get angry.""
[Message 104] AVA: ""Good point. Could be someone she sentenced.""
[Message 105] CHLOE: ""Yeah. Or someone Riley was investigating.""
[Message 106] LIAM: ""This is all so messed up.""
[Message 107] AVA: ""Agreed. I keep thinking about their families.""
[Message 108] CHLOE: ""Me too. It's heartbreaking.""
[Message 109] LIAM: ""Let's try to do something good this week. Volunteer somewhere, maybe.""
[Message 110] AVA: ""That's a great idea, Liam.""
[Message 111] CHLOE: ""I'm in. We could go to the animal shelter.""
[Message 112] LIAM: ""Perfect. We can do that on Saturday.""
[Message 113] AVA: ""Sounds like a plan.""
[Message 114] CHLOE: ""Okay, animal shelter on Saturday it is.""
[Message 115] LIAM: ""Good. Something positive for a change.""
[Message 116] AVA: ""Exactly.""
[Message 117] CHLOE: ""Did either of you guys see Riley Thompson at the gym often?""
[Message 118] LIAM: ""Yeah, pretty regularly. Usually in the mornings.""
[Message 119] AVA: ""Same. She was always on the treadmill.""
[Message 120] CHLOE: ""Okay. Just trying to remember.""
[Message 121] LIAM: ""Why are you asking so many questions, Chloe? You seem... focused.""
[Message 122] CHLOE: ""I'm just trying to understand what happened. Is that a crime?""
[Message 123] AVA: ""No, of course not. We all are.""
[Message 124] LIAM: ""Just feels like you're grilling us, that’s all.""
[Message 125] CHLOE: ""Sorry. Didn't mean to come off that way.""
[Message 126] AVA: ""It's okay, Chloe. We're all a little stressed.""
[Message 127] LIAM: ""Let's just drop it, okay? No need to fight.""
[Message 128] CHLOE: ""Agreed.""
[Message 129] AVA: ""Agreed.""
[Message 130] LIAM: ""So, animal shelter on Saturday?""
[Message 131] CHLOE: ""Yeah, animal shelter on Saturday.""
[Message 132] AVA: ""Looking forward to it.""
[Message 133] LIAM: ""Me too. It'll be good to get out.""
[Message 134] CHLOE: ""Anyone hear anything from the cops?""
[Message 135] AVA: ""Not a peep.""
[Message 136] LIAM: ""They're probably keeping things quiet until they have something solid.""
[Message 137] CHLOE: ""Yeah, I guess so.""
[Message 138] AVA: ""It's frustrating though. We all just want answers.""
[Message 139] LIAM: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 140] CHLOE: ""I heard Morgan was about to rule on a really big case.""
[Message 141] AVA: ""Really? What kind of case?""
[Message 142] LIAM: ""Probably something that pissed off a lot of people.""
[Message 143] CHLOE: ""Maybe that's it. Someone wanted to stop her.""
[Message 144] AVA: ""That's messed up.""
[Message 145] LIAM: ""Yeah, but not surprising. Power corrupts. Morgan purposefully provoked that criminal""
[Message 146] CHLOE: ""True.""
[Message 147] AVA: ""Hey, anyone free for coffee tomorrow morning?""
[Message 148] CHLOE: ""I could use a caffeine boost.""
[Message 149] LIAM: ""Count me in. Need to get out of the house.""
[Message 150] AVA: ""Great! I'll text you guys the details.""
[Message 151] CHLOE: ""Sounds good.""
[Message 152] LIAM: ""Cool.""
[Message 153] CHLOE: ""This whole thing is just so… unbelievable.""
[Message 154] AVA: ""I know. It's like something out of a movie.""
[Message 155] LIAM: ""A really bad movie.""
[Message 156] CHLOE: ""I wonder if they'll ever find the murder weapon.""
[Message 157] AVA: ""Hopefully. That would be a big clue.""
[Message 158] LIAM: ""Yeah, or if someone saw something and is too scared to come forward.""
[Message 159] CHLOE: ""That's possible. Maybe they think the killer will come after them.""
[Message 160] AVA: ""This is all so scary.""
[Message 161] LIAM: ""I know. Let's just try to stick together, okay?""
[Message 162] CHLOE: ""Definitely. Safety in numbers.""
[Message 163] AVA: ""Agreed. We're here for each other.""
[Message 164] LIAM: ""Always.""
[Message 165] CHLOE: ""Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.""
[Message 166] AVA: ""Anytime, Chloe.""
[Message 167] LIAM: ""Yeah, anytime.""
[Message 168] CHLOE: ""So, coffee tomorrow then?""
[Message 169] AVA: ""Yep! Tomorrow it is.""
[Message 170] LIAM: ""Looking forward to it.""
[Message 171] CHLOE: ""Me too. Need to get my mind off things.""
[Message 172] AVA: ""Same here.""

[Message 2] Jordan: ""I prefer looking at it from my porch with coffee. But volunteering waits for no one, even the sun.""
[Message 3] Alex: ""True that! Are you excited about the charity event this weekend? The 'Funny Bone Fundraiser'?""
[Message 4] Jordan: ""Excited is a strong word. Hoping it doesn't rain would be more accurate. And that the jokes aren't *too* painful.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Come on! It's for a good cause. Think of the laughter... even if it's forced.""
[Message 6] Jordan: ""I'm picturing a lot of polite chuckles and awkward silences. Speaking of, did you bring snacks?""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Of course! I have granola bars and those little mandarin oranges. The ones that are ridiculously easy to peel.""
[Message 8] Jordan: ""Bless you. I forgot to eat breakfast. Granola bar, please. What kind of acts are they having at the fundraiser?""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Mostly stand-up, I think. A couple of local improv groups. And... a magician who specializes in dad jokes.""
[Message 10] Jordan: ""Oh, dear. I may need extra coffee to survive that. Dad jokes are my kryptonite.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Hey, maybe they'll be so bad, they're good! Like a train wreck you can't look away from.""
[Message 12] Jordan: ""I'm not sure that's how comedy is supposed to work, but I appreciate the optimism. Did you ever learn to play that ukulele you mentioned?""
[Message 13] Alex: ""I'm still trying! My fingers are not cooperating. It's harder than it looks. Maybe I should try stand-up instead.""
[Message 14] Jordan: ""Please don't. For the sake of everyone involved. Stick to the ukulele. Less chance of public humiliation.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Harsh! But fair. What about you? Any hidden talents you're bringing to the volunteer party?""
[Message 16] Jordan: ""I'm exceptionally good at stapling things. And alphabetizing. High-energy stuff, I know.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""We need people who can alphabetize! Seriously, that's a crucial skill. You're a lifesaver.""
[Message 18] Jordan: ""I aim to please. As long as 'pleasing' involves minimal interaction with clowns or ventriloquists.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Clowns are definitely a no-go. I don't think the Funny Bone Fundraiser is ready for that level of terror.""
[Message 20] Jordan: ""Good. Less existential dread is always appreciated. What time does this thing actually start?""
[Message 21] Alex: ""I think they said 9 AM. We're early birds! Ready to catch the worm... or the awkward comedian.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""I'm starting to regret waking up this early. Maybe I should have just stayed home and watched paint dry.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Don't say that! Think of the children! Think of the... funny bones!""
[Message 24] Jordan: ""Okay, okay. You've guilt-tripped me sufficiently. What kind of music do you like playing on the ukulele, besides off-key renditions of pop songs?""
[Message 25] Alex: ""I'm trying to learn some old jazz standards. But mostly it sounds like a cat being strangled.""
[Message 26] Jordan: ""Relatable. My singing voice is similarly… unique.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""We should form a band! 'The Tone-Deaf Duo'! We'd be famous!""
[Message 28] Jordan: ""I think I'd rather staple things in silence. It's less painful for everyone.""

[Message 32] Jordan: ""Agreed. Speaking of crimes... do you think they'll have any coffee at the fundraiser?""
[Message 33] Alex: ""That's a legitimate concern. I'll check the volunteer briefing when we get in. Coffee is non-negotiable.""

[Message 5] Leo: ""Yeah, good idea. Thanks, Maya.""
[Message 6] Kai: ""Police everywhere. Someone said there was a fire.""
[Message 7] Maya: ""A fire? At the bus terminal? That's awful!""
[Message 8] Kai: ""Yeah, real bad. Apparently, two people died.""
[Message 9] Leo: ""Oh my god, that's terrible! Who were they?""
[Message 10] Maya: ""I hope it wasn't anyone we know.""
[Message 11] Kai: ""One was a Judge, I think her name was Emily Carter. The other was a security guard, a Transgender woman. ""
[Message 12] Leo: ""Emily? I think I met her once at a bar. What a tragedy.""
[Message 13] Maya: ""This is so messed up. What kind of person does that?""
[Message 14] Kai: ""A messed up person, obviously.""
[Message 15] Leo: ""Any idea how it started? Accident?""
[Message 16] Kai: ""Don't think so. Heard whispers of Arson by setting a fire.""
[Message 17] Maya: ""Arson by setting a fire? Someone purposefully set the terminal on fire?""
[Message 18] Leo: ""That's insane! They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 19] Kai: ""Yep. Hope they catch whoever did it.""
[Message 20] Maya: ""Me too. This city is getting scarier every day.""
[Message 21] Leo: ""Tell me about it. I saw someone acting real weird around that area a week ago.""
[Message 22] Maya: ""Weird how?""
[Message 23] Leo: ""Just… intense. Staring at the terminal like they wanted to burn it down. Cleft chin, if I remember right.""
[Message 24] Kai: ""Cleft chin, huh? Interesting.""
[Message 25] Maya: ""Did you report it, Leo?""
[Message 26] Leo: ""Nah, didn't think much of it at the time. Just figured they were having a bad day. Wish I had now.""

[Message 28] Leo: ""Yeah, you're right. I will. Where’s that number?""
[Message 29] Maya: ""Good. Every little bit helps.""
[Message 30] Kai: ""So, anyone seen the new exhibit at the art museum?""
[Message 31] Maya: ""Not yet. Is it good?""
[Message 32] Kai: ""Pretty cool. Some interesting stuff. We should go sometime.""
[Message 33] Leo: ""Sure, I'm in. After I give this statement to the police.""
[Message 34] Maya: ""Okay, let me know when.""
[Message 35] Kai: ""Will do. Good luck with the police, Leo.""
[Message 36] Leo: ""Thanks, man. Appreciate it.""
[Message 37] Maya: ""So awful about Emily. She was actually a really good Judge.""
[Message 38] Kai: ""Yeah, a real shame.""
[Message 39] Leo: ""Yep.""
[Message 40] Maya: ""Wonder if it had anything to do with one of her cases?""
[Message 41] Kai: ""Could be. People get angry at Judges all the time.""
[Message 42] Leo: ""True. Makes you think.""
[Message 43] Maya: ""I'm just glad I don't have enemies like that.""
[Message 44] Kai: ""Haha, me neither. I try to be nice to everyone.""
[Message 45] Leo: ""Same here. Although, I did get into a heated argument with my landlord last week.""
[Message 46] Maya: ""Over what?""
[Message 47] Leo: ""Rent increase. He's trying to screw me over. Said he wanted to get rid of him.""
[Message 48] Kai: ""Landlords, man. Always trying to squeeze you dry.""
[Message 49] Maya: ""Tell me about it. Mine's the same way.""
[Message 50] Leo: ""Anyways, gotta go call the police. Talk later.""
[Message 51] Maya: ""Okay, good luck!""
[Message 52] Kai: ""Later, Leo.""
[Message 53] Maya: ""This is all so disturbing. I can't stop thinking about it.""
[Message 54] Kai: ""Yeah, it's pretty heavy. Maybe we should watch a funny movie tonight to take our minds off it?""
[Message 55] Maya: ""That's a good idea. What were you thinking?""
[Message 56] Kai: ""I don't know, something with Will Ferrell?""
[Message 57] Maya: ""Perfect. I'm in.""
[Message 58] Kai: ""Cool. I'll bring the snacks.""

[Message 60] Kai: ""See ya.""

[Message 62] Maya: ""Awesome, Leo! You did good.""
[Message 63] Kai: ""Nice one, Leo. Hopefully, that helps.""
[Message 64] Leo: ""Hope so too. Feeling a bit drained now, though.""
[Message 65] Maya: ""Totally understandable. That's a lot to process.""
[Message 66] Kai: ""Yeah, take it easy, Leo. You deserve a break.""
[Message 67] Leo: ""Thanks, guys. Might just chill and watch some TV.""
[Message 68] Maya: ""Sounds like a plan.""
[Message 69] Kai: ""Anything good on?""
[Message 70] Leo: ""Not sure yet. Gotta scroll through Netflix. Any recommendations?""
[Message 71] Maya: ""Tiger King is always a classic.""
[Message 72] Kai: ""Haha, yeah, that's a good one. Or maybe something lighter?""
[Message 73] Leo: ""Yeah, maybe something lighter. I'll see what I can find.""
[Message 74] Maya: ""Okay, well, enjoy!""
[Message 75] Kai: ""Have a good night, Leo.""
[Message 76] Leo: ""You too, guys.""
[Message 77] Maya: ""Kai, you think Leo actually saw something, or is he just trying to be helpful?""
[Message 78] Kai: ""Hard to say. He can be a bit dramatic sometimes.""
[Message 79] Maya: ""True. But that cleft chin detail was pretty specific. Unless he's a psychic.""
[Message 80] Kai: ""Maybe he saw it on the news or something and is subconsciously remembering it?""
[Message 81] Maya: ""Possible. Or maybe he saw something and doesn't realize how important it is.""
[Message 82] Kai: ""Yeah, Occam's razor. He was buying Arson by setting a fire at the store. I didn't think too much of it, but...""
[Message 83] Maya: ""Buying Arson by setting a fire? When was this?""
[Message 84] Kai: ""A couple of days ago. Should I tell the cops, or am I overthinking it?""
[Message 85] Maya: ""Better safe than sorry. Tell them.""
[Message 86] Kai: ""Okay, I will. This is getting intense.""
[Message 87] Maya: ""I know, right? I just want this to be over.""
[Message 88] Kai: ""Me too. I hope they catch the person responsible soon.""
[Message 89] Maya: ""So, movie still on for tonight?""

[Message 91] Maya: ""Agreed. See you later.""

[Message 94] Maya: ""See? I knew it had something to do with her job.""
[Message 95] Kai: ""That's messed up. People are crazy.""
[Message 96] Leo: ""Yeah, she was a tough Judge. I bet that made enemies.""
[Message 97] Maya: ""Definitely. This just keeps getting more complicated.""
[Message 98] Kai: ""I know. It's like a bad movie.""
[Message 99] Leo: ""Hope they figure it out soon. Before anyone else gets hurt.""

[Message 111] Kai: Disagreements about what?
[Message 112] Leo: Work stuff. Schedules, tasks… you know.
[Message 113] Jamie: Right, right.
[Message 114] Kai: (Later that night) Jamie, you think Leo is holding something back?
[Message 115] Jamie: It's a strange question but Maybe. He seems awfully defensive.
[Message 116] Kai: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking too.
[Message 117] Jamie: Maybe we're just paranoid.
[Message 118] Kai: Maybe. But something feels off.

[Message 121] Jamie: Be careful.
[Message 122] Kai: Always am.
[Message 123] Leo: (To Jamie) Why were you asking me about Chris?
[Message 124] Jamie: Just trying to piece things together.
[Message 125] Leo: You think I had something to do with it?
[Message 126] Jamie: I didn't say that.
[Message 127] Leo: You implied it.
[Message 128] Jamie: Look, I'm just trying to figure out what happened.
[Message 129] Leo: Well, don't go accusing me of anything.
[Message 130] Jamie: I'm not.
[Message 131] Leo: Just back off.
[Message 132] Jamie: Okay, okay. Chill.
[Message 133] Kai: (Separately to Jamie) See? Defensive.
[Message 134] Jamie: (To Kai) Told you.
[Message 135] Kai: (To Jamie) What do we do?
[Message 136] Jamie: (To Kai) We watch. We listen.
[Message 137] Kai: (To Jamie) Agreed.
[Message 138] Kai: Leo, you free to grab a beer later?
[Message 139] Leo: Maybe. Why?
[Message 140] Kai: Just wanna talk. Catch up.
[Message 141] Leo: About what?
[Message 142] Kai: Just life, man. Relax.
[Message 143] Leo: Fine. But no more questions about Chris, alright?
[Message 144] Kai: Deal.
[Message 145] Jamie: (To Kai) Be careful. Don't push too hard.
[Message 146] Kai: (To Jamie) I know. Just trying to get a read on him.
[Message 147] Jamie: (To Kai) Good luck.
[Message 148] Kai: (To Jamie) Thanks.
[Message 149] Kai: (Later that night, after meeting with Leo) He's definitely hiding something.
[Message 150] Jamie: What makes you say that?
[Message 151] Kai: He kept deflecting. Avoided eye contact. And he kept fidgeting.
[Message 152] Jamie: Classic signs.
[Message 153] Kai: Exactly. Plus, he knew details about Chris that he shouldn't have known.
[Message 154] Jamie: Like what?
[Message 155] Kai: He knew Chris was planning on leaving town. Chris hadn't told anyone that.
[Message 156] Jamie: Wow. That's… incriminating.
[Message 157] Kai: I know, right?
[Message 158] Jamie: We need to tell the cops everything.
[Message 159] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 160] Leo: (The next day) I heard they're looking at surveillance footage from Retail Store.
[Message 161] Jamie: Yeah? What'd you hear?
[Message 162] Leo: Just that they're reviewing it. Probably trying to find the shooter.
[Message 163] Kai: Makes sense.
[Message 164] Jamie: You think they'll find anything?
[Message 165] Leo: Maybe. Depends on the quality of the cameras.
[Message 166] Kai: True.
[Message 167] Jamie: Hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 168] Leo: Me too. They are going away for a long time for this.
[Message 169] Kai: For sure.
[Message 170] Jamie: (Later that day) Kai, I found something out.
[Message 171] Kai: What is it?
[Message 172] Jamie: Remember when I said that there was a argument on Saturday between Sarah and a customer?
[Message 173] Kai: Yeah, who was it?
[Message 174] Jamie: It was you. Your shouting probably provoked him, resulting in her death.
[Message 175] Kai: Me? Thats a lie!
[Message 176] Jamie: And you were buying Shooting with a handgun at the store last week. Intended for what, Kai?
[Message 177] Kai: I swear, i didn't mean for any of this to happen.
[Message 178] Jamie: You can't take it back, Kai.
[Message 179] Kai: You're right.
[Message 180] Kai: (To Leo) I screwed up, Leo.
[Message 181] Leo: Screwed up how?
[Message 182] Kai: I told Jamie about Chris leaving town.
[Message 183] Leo: You what?!
[Message 184] Kai: I panicked.
[Message 185] Leo: You idiot!
[Message 186] Kai: What do we do?
[Message 187] Leo: We deny everything.
[Message 188] Kai: But Jamie knows…
[Message 189] Leo: Let me handle Jamie.
[Message 190] Kai: (To Jamie) Leo said something about handling you. What does that mean?
[Message 191] Jamie: I don't know and I don't care. I'm done with this.
[Message 192] Kai: Please don't. I dont want to die in prison.
[Message 193] Jamie: I'm going to the cops. They need to know the truth.
[Message 194] Kai: No, please! Don't do this!
[Message 195] Jamie: Goodbye, Kai.",1,
102,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Hey everyone! So excited for tonight's family dinner. Anything I should bring?""
[Message 2] Jamie: ""Nope, Alex! I've got it covered. Just bring yourselves!""
[Message 3] Sarah: ""Can't wait! I'm starving already. How's the theater planning going, Pat?""
[Message 4] Pat: ""It's coming along! We're narrowing down play choices. Lots of Shakespeare this year, apparently.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Shakespeare? Oof, haven't touched that since high school. Any comedies?""
[Message 6] Pat: ""A Midsummer Night's Dream is definitely on the list! And maybe Twelfth Night.""
[Message 7] Jamie: ""I love Midsummer! Such a fun play.""
[Message 8] Sarah: ""Me too! I saw a fantastic production a few years ago.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""I'm more of a musical theater person myself. Anyone seen Hamilton?""
[Message 10] Pat: ""Oh, Hamilton is fantastic! But for our local theater, it's a bit ambitious, haha.""
[Message 11] Jamie: ""True. Costumes alone would bankrupt them!""
[Message 12] Sarah: ""Has anyone considered doing something completely different? Like an original play?""
[Message 13] Pat: ""We talked about it, but finding a good, original script is tough. Copyrights and all that jazz.""
[Message 14] Alex: ""Yeah, the legal stuff can be a nightmare.""
[Message 15] Jamie: ""So, Shakespeare it is! At least it's classic.""
[Message 16] Sarah: ""I'm okay with that. Good acting can make any play shine.""
[Message 17] Pat: ""Exactly! We're focusing on finding talented actors.""
[Message 18] Alex: ""Speaking of talent, is anyone watching that new talent show on TV?""
[Message 19] Jamie: ""The singing one? I caught a few episodes. It's pretty good.""
[Message 20] Sarah: ""I'm more into the baking competitions myself. All that sugar!""
[Message 21] Pat: ""Haha, you and me both, Sarah! Back to theater, though…""
[Message 22] Alex: ""Right, right. What kind of set design are you thinking of?""
[Message 23] Pat: ""For Midsummer, we're leaning towards a magical forest vibe. Lots of greenery and fairy lights.""
[Message 24] Jamie: ""That sounds beautiful!""
[Message 25] Sarah: ""I can already picture it. What about the costumes?""
[Message 26] Pat: ""Lots of flowing fabrics and earthy tones for the fairies. Athenian costumes will be more traditional.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Nice! Are you making them yourselves?""
[Message 28] Pat: ""We have a dedicated costume crew who are incredibly talented.""
[Message 29] Jamie: ""They always do an amazing job.""
[Message 30] Sarah: ""Okay, I'm officially excited to see this!""
[Message 31] Pat: ""We'll keep you posted on auditions and performance dates!""
[Message 32] Alex: ""Sounds great! So, dinner tonight at 6?""
[Message 33] Jamie: ""Perfect! See you all then.""
[Message 34] Sarah: ""Can't wait!""
[Message 35] Pat: ""Looking forward to it!""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Has anyone heard from Chris lately?""
[Message 37] Jamie: ""Not recently, no. I think they're still traveling.""
[Message 38] Sarah: ""Yeah, I saw some pictures on their social media. Looks like they're having a blast.""
[Message 39] Pat: ""Good for them! Back to Midsummer, have we finalized the cast size?""
[Message 40] Alex: ""Whoops, sorry! What's the ideal cast size for that play?""
[Message 41] Pat: ""It varies, but we're aiming for around 20-25 people.""
[Message 42] Jamie: ""That's a good number.""
[Message 43] Sarah: ""Plenty of opportunities for everyone to get involved.""
[Message 44] Pat: ""Exactly! We want to make it a community effort.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""That's awesome, Pat! You're doing great work.""
[Message 46] Pat: ""Thanks, Alex! I'm passionate about bringing theater to Mesa.""
[Message 47] Jamie: ""And we appreciate it!""
[Message 48] Sarah: ""Totally! It adds so much to the community.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Okay, I'm heading out now. See you all at dinner!""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""Drive safe!""
[Message 51] Sarah: ""See ya!""
[Message 52] Pat: ""Safe travels!""
[Message 53] Jamie: ""Anyone else thinking of bringing a game for after dinner?""
[Message 54] Sarah: ""Ooh, good idea! I've got a new board game I've been wanting to try.""
[Message 55] Pat: ""I'm always up for a game!""
[Message 56] Jamie: ""Perfect! I'll bring some snacks too.""
[Message 57] Sarah: ""Awesome! This is going to be a fun night.""
[Message 58] Pat: ""Definitely! I need a break from Shakespeare for a few hours anyway, haha.""
[Message 59] Jamie: ""Haha, understandable!""
[Message 60] Sarah: ""So, what kind of play are you hoping to do next year, Pat?""
[Message 61] Pat: ""That's a good question! I'd love to do something more modern, maybe a contemporary drama.""
[Message 62] Jamie: ""That would be interesting.""
[Message 63] Sarah: ""Something with some real substance.""
[Message 64] Pat: ""Exactly! Something that challenges the audience and makes them think.""
[Message 65] Jamie: ""I'm on board with that.""
[Message 66] Sarah: ""Me too! As long as it's not too depressing, haha.""
[Message 67] Pat: ""Haha, I'll keep that in mind! We need to balance the drama with some humor.""
[Message 68] Jamie: ""Always a good idea.""
[Message 69] Sarah: ""Speaking of humor, have you seen that new stand-up special on Netflix?""
[Message 70] Pat: ""No, I haven't! Is it any good?""
[Message 71] Jamie: ""It's hilarious! You should definitely check it out.""
[Message 72] Sarah: ""I second that! I was laughing so hard I cried.""
[Message 73] Pat: ""Okay, I'll add it to my list. Thanks for the recommendation!""
[Message 74] Jamie: ""No problem! Always happy to share a good laugh.""
[Message 75] Sarah: ""What are you making for dinner tonight, Jamie?""
[Message 76] Jamie: ""I'm making lasagna! Everyone loves lasagna.""
[Message 77] Pat: ""Lasagna is always a winner!""
[Message 78] Sarah: ""My favorite!""
[Message 79] Jamie: ""And I'm making a big salad and garlic bread to go with it.""
[Message 80] Pat: ""Sounds delicious!""
[Message 81] Sarah: ""I'm officially even more excited for dinner now.""
[Message 82] Jamie: ""Haha, good! I'm glad to hear it.""
[Message 83] Pat: ""Are you using your family recipe, Jamie?""
[Message 84] Jamie: ""Of course! It's the best lasagna recipe in the world.""
[Message 85] Sarah: ""I wouldn't doubt it!""
[Message 86] Pat: ""Okay, I'm going to get back to work. Talk to you all later!""
[Message 87] Jamie: ""Sounds good! See you at 6.""
[Message 88] Sarah: ""Bye!""
[Message 89] Pat: ""Bye!""
[Message 90] Jamie: ""Just finished setting the table. Everything's almost ready!""
[Message 91] Sarah: ""Great! I'm leaving my place now. Should be there in about 15 minutes.""
[Message 92] Jamie: ""Perfect! Drive safe.""
[Message 93] Sarah: ""Will do!""
[Message 94] Jamie: ""Thinking of putting on some background music. Any requests?""
[Message 95] Sarah: ""Hmm, maybe something mellow and relaxing.""
[Message 96] Jamie: ""Got it! I'll put on some jazz.""
[Message 97] Sarah: ""Perfect!""
[Message 98] Jamie: ""Just pulled the lasagna out of the oven. Smells amazing!""
[Message 99] Sarah: ""Oh man, I'm so hungry.""
[Message 100] Jamie: ""Haha, almost there!""
[Message 101] Jamie: ""Alex just arrived! You're next, Sarah.""
[Message 102] Sarah: ""Awesome! See you soon.""
[Message 103] Jamie: ""Putting out the drinks now. Water, soda, and iced tea.""
[Message 104] Sarah: ""Sounds good! I'll grab a water.""
[Message 105] Jamie: ""Everything's ready! Just waiting on you.""
[Message 106] Sarah: ""Almost there! Just a few more minutes.""
[Message 107] Jamie: ""No rush! Just excited to see you.""
[Message 108] Sarah: ""Me too!""
[Message 109] Jamie: ""Alex is telling me about their latest project at work. Sounds intense!""
[Message 110] Sarah: ""Oh yeah? What are they working on?""
[Message 111] Jamie: ""Something about streamlining processes and improving efficiency. I didn't understand half of it, haha.""
[Message 112] Sarah: ""Haha, same here. I'm more of a creative type.""
[Message 113] Jamie: ""Exactly! That's why we make a good team.""
[Message 114] Sarah: ""Totally!""
[Message 115] Jamie: ""Just put out the garlic bread. The whole house smells amazing!""
[Message 116] Sarah: ""Ugh, stop making me hungry! I'm almost there, I swear.""
[Message 117] Jamie: ""Haha, okay, okay! Just trying to build the anticipation.""
[Message 118] Sarah: ""You're doing a great job!""
[Message 119] Jamie: ""Thanks! I try my best.""
[Message 120] Jamie: ""Alex just offered to help with the dishes after dinner. So sweet!""
[Message 121] Sarah: ""That's nice of them! I'll help too.""
[Message 122] Jamie: ""You guys are the best! Makes my life so much easier.""
[Message 123] Sarah: ""That's what friends are for!""
[Message 124] Jamie: ""Exactly! Okay, I think I hear a car pulling up...""
[Message 125] Sarah: ""That's me! I'm here!""
[Message 126] Jamie: ""Yay! Come on in!""
[Message 127] Jamie: ""Dinner is served!""
[Message 128] Sarah: ""Smells amazing!""
[Message 129] Alex: ""Lasagna looks incredible, Jamie!""
[Message 130] Jamie: ""Thanks, guys! Dig in!""
[Message 131] Sarah: ""Mmm, this is delicious!""
[Message 132] Alex: ""You've outdone yourself, Jamie!""
[Message 133] Jamie: ""Glad you like it!""
[Message 134] Sarah: ""Seriously, this is the best lasagna I've ever had.""
[Message 135] Alex: ""I second that!""
[Message 136] Jamie: ""You guys are making me blush!""
[Message 137] Sarah: ""It's true though! You're a culinary genius.""
[Message 138] Alex: ""So, Pat still hasn't arrived?""
[Message 139] Jamie: ""Not yet. I'll text them.""
[Message 140] Sarah: ""Maybe they're stuck in traffic.""
[Message 141] Alex: ""Could be. Mesa traffic can be brutal.""
[Message 142] Jamie: ""Just texted Pat. They said they're running a bit late, but they'll be here soon.""
[Message 143] Sarah: ""Okay, good to know!""
[Message 144] Alex: ""More lasagna, anyone?""
[Message 145] Sarah: ""Don't mind if I do!""
[Message 146] Jamie: ""Help yourselves!""
[Message 147] Sarah: ""Seriously, this lasagna is so good I could eat the whole pan.""
[Message 148] Alex: ""Haha, save some for the rest of us!""
[Message 149] Jamie: ""There's plenty to go around!""
[Message 150] Sarah: ""Okay, okay, I'll share.""
[Message 151] Alex: ""So, what game are we playing after dinner?""
[Message 152] Sarah: ""I brought Ticket to Ride!""
[Message 153] Jamie: ""Ooh, I love Ticket to Ride!""
[Message 154] Alex: ""Sounds fun! I've never played before.""
[Message 155] Jamie: ""I'll teach you! It's easy to learn.""
[Message 156] Sarah: ""Yeah, it's a great game!""
[Message 157] Jamie: ""Okay, everyone, let's finish up so we can start the game!""

[Message 2] LIAM: ""Yeah, crazy! Two people dead. Any idea who they were?""
[Message 3] CHLOE: ""I think one of them was Mark... the drug dealer? And the other, Dana, a security guard there. So awful.""
[Message 4] LIAM: ""Mark? Wow. He always seemed pretty chill.""
[Message 5] AVERY: ""I heard about it too. Absolutely devastating. Especially for their families.""
[Message 6] CHLOE: ""Seriously. It's so close to home. Makes you think.""

[Message 10] LIAM: ""Purposeful? What do you mean, Avery?""
[Message 11] AVERY: ""I don't know. The news said it was… violent. Not just random.""
[Message 12] CHLOE: ""Did they say how?""
[Message 13] LIAM: ""They're not releasing details, Chloe. Just that the manager found them this morning when they opened. Sunrise.""
[Message 14] CHLOE: ""Sunrise? That's rough. Someone was up early. Or never went to bed.""
[Message 15] AVERY: ""I can't sleep. This whole thing is giving me nightmares.""
[Message 16] LIAM: ""Nightmares? You okay, Avery?""
[Message 17] AVERY: ""Yeah, just… shaken. It’s just terrible that such a thing could happen to Dana. She was so ambitious.""

[Message 19] LIAM: ""Hey, anyone seen Sarah lately? She was supposed to cover my shift yesterday but didn't show.""
[Message 20] CHLOE: ""Sarah? No, I haven't. Weird.""
[Message 21] AVERY: ""I think Sarah was working there last week. She didn’t mention she was still on the schedule.""
[Message 22] LIAM: ""That is odd. She needed the money. I hope she's okay.""
[Message 23] CHLOE: ""Maybe she knew Mark? I feel like she would get along with someone optimistic""
[Message 24] AVERY: ""Maybe. It's probably nothing. Just… bad timing.""
[Message 25] LIAM: ""True. People skip shifts all the time. Still, kinda worrying, right?""
[Message 26] CHLOE: ""Yeah, a little. Especially now. Let’s just try not to jump to conclusions.""

[Message 49] AVERY: ""Maybe she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. If she had stayed home, maybe none of this would have happened.""

104,"[Message 1] Alex: Morning everyone! Ready to talk art?
[Message 2] River: Good morning! Always ready to talk art, Alex. What's on the agenda?
[Message 3] Jamie: Morning! Art and sunrise, a perfect combo. Just got to this electronics store.
[Message 4] Jordan: Morning all. I'm at my doctor's appointment, but I'll chime in when I can. Art talk sounds good.
[Message 5] Sam: Morning folks. Art sounds better than work, that's for sure.
[Message 6] Alex: So, I was thinking about abstract art this morning. What are your thoughts? Love it or hate it?
[Message 7] River: I'm a big fan of abstract art. The freedom of expression is amazing.
[Message 8] Jamie: I appreciate the *idea* of abstract art, but sometimes I just don't *get* it.
[Message 9] Sam: I'm with Jamie. Some abstract stuff is cool, other times it just looks like a mess.
[Message 10] Alex: Haha, fair enough. I think it's about the feeling it evokes more than the literal representation.
[Message 11] Jordan: (Sitting in the waiting room) Agreed, Alex. It's about the emotional connection. I'm more of a landscape person myself, though.
[Message 12] River: Landscapes are beautiful! So calming.
[Message 13] Jamie: Landscapes are great. I saw a stunning one on a postcard recently. Reminded me I need a vacation.
[Message 14] Sam: Vacation? Yes, please. Maybe a trip to see some famous art in person?
[Message 15] Alex: That's a great idea, Sam!
[Message 16] River: Ooh, like what? The Louvre?
[Message 17] Jamie: Louvre would be amazing, but maybe something a bit less crowded first.
[Message 18] Sam: Maybe the Uffizi Gallery in Florence? Smaller than the Louvre, but still packed with incredible art.
[Message 19] Alex: Florence sounds amazing! Okay, adding that to the bucket list.
[Message 20] River: Me too!
[Message 21] Jamie: Count me in!
[Message 22] Jordan: Still here... Doctor is running late. Anyway, Uffizi sounds fantastic. Botticelli!
[Message 23] Sam: Botticelli is amazing! The Birth of Venus is iconic.
[Message 24] Alex: Okay, while we dream of Florence, back to abstract. Any particular abstract artists you guys admire?
[Message 25] River: Rothko. His color fields are mesmerizing.
[Message 26] Jamie: Kandinsky. The colors and shapes are so dynamic.
[Message 27] Sam: I'm more of a Pollock guy. The action and energy in his paintings is captivating.
[Message 28] Alex: Pollock is cool. I like how chaotic it is.
[Message 29] Jordan: Rothko, definitely. The Seagram Murals... powerful. Still waiting...
[Message 30] River: Oh man, I'd love to see the Seagram Murals in person.
[Message 31] Jamie: They're supposed to be incredible. Someday!
[Message 32] Sam: So, anyone here actively *make* art?
[Message 33] Alex: I dabble in sketching, mostly landscapes. Nothing fancy.
[Message 34] River: I do digital art! Mostly character design and fan art.
[Message 35] Jamie: I knit. Does that count? Fiber art!
[Message 36] Sam: Knitting definitely counts! Creative expression is creative expression.
[Message 37] Alex: Agreed!
[Message 38] Jordan: Painting. Mostly watercolors. Trying to capture the Florida light. Almost my turn!
[Message 39] River: Watercolors are so beautiful and delicate.
[Message 40] Jamie: I've always admired people who can do watercolors. Seems so hard.
[Message 41] Sam: I tried painting once. Ended up looking like a toddler finger-painted.
[Message 42] Alex: Haha, we all start somewhere, Sam!
[Message 43] River: Practice makes perfect!
[Message 44] Jamie: True!
[Message 45] Jordan: True. And lots of patience.
[Message 46] Sam: Speaking of practice, I should probably get back to work. But this was a nice distraction.
[Message 47] Alex: Yeah, me too. Thanks for the art chat, everyone!
[Message 48] River: Anytime! It was fun.
[Message 49] Jamie: Definitely! Have a good day, all.
[Message 50] Jordan: You too! Finally going in...
[Message 51] Alex: Hey, anyone know any good documentaries about art?
[Message 52] River: ""Exit Through the Gift Shop"" is pretty interesting. It's about street art, but it's thought-provoking.
[Message 53] Jamie: ""Art 21"" is a classic. It's a series on PBS that profiles contemporary artists.
[Message 54] Sam: I've heard good things about ""Abstract: The Art of Design"" on Netflix.
[Message 55] Alex: Awesome, thanks guys! I'll check those out.
[Message 56] River: No problem!
[Message 57] Jamie: You're welcome!
[Message 58] Jordan: Art 21 is great! Lots of variety. Done at the doctor! Everything's fine.
[Message 59] Sam: Glad to hear everything's okay, Jordan!
[Message 60] Alex: Good news, Jordan!
[Message 61] River: Yay, Jordan!
[Message 62] Jamie: That's great, Jordan!
[Message 63] Jordan: Thanks, everyone! Now, back to art... anything new happening in Jacksonville?
[Message 64] Alex: Good question, Jordan. I haven't been to an art gallery here in ages.
[Message 65] River: I think the Cummer Museum has some interesting exhibits coming up.
[Message 66] Jamie: I saw something about a local artist showcase at CoRK Arts District.
[Message 67] Sam: CoRK is always worth checking out. Lots of cool studios there.
[Message 68] Alex: I'll look into those! Thanks!
[Message 69] River: Anytime!
[Message 70] Jamie: You're welcome!
[Message 71] Jordan: CoRK is good. The first Wednesday of each month they have open studios, I think.
[Message 72] Sam: Yep, first Wednesday!
[Message 73] Alex: Perfect! Maybe we should all go sometime.
[Message 74] River: That sounds like a fun idea!
[Message 75] Jamie: I'm in!
[Message 76] Sam: I'm game.
[Message 77] Jordan: Sounds good to me!
[Message 78] Alex: Awesome! We'll figure out a date.
[Message 79] River: Great!
[Message 80] Jamie: Looking forward to it!
[Message 81] Sam: Me too!
[Message 82] Jordan: Me three!
[Message 83] Alex: So, shifting gears slightly... Anyone seen any good movies lately?
[Message 84] River: I watched ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" recently. It was mind-blowing.
[Message 85] Jamie: I finally saw ""Parasite."" So good!
[Message 86] Sam: I'm still catching up on Oscar winners. ""CODA"" was really touching.
[Message 87] Alex: I've been meaning to watch ""Everything Everywhere All at Once.""
[Message 88] Jordan: Haven't been to the movies in ages. Too expensive!
[Message 89] River: It's definitely worth a watch, Alex.
[Message 90] Jamie: Agreed!
[Message 91] Sam: I usually wait for things to come out on streaming.
[Message 92] Alex: Smart move, Sam.
[Message 93] Jordan: Yeah, streaming is the way to go.
[Message 94] River: What kind of movies do you usually like, Jordan?
[Message 95] Jamie: Good question!
[Message 96] Sam: Yeah, what's your go-to genre?
[Message 97] Alex: Curious to know!
[Message 98] Jordan: I like historical dramas, usually. Something with good costumes and a compelling story.
[Message 99] River: Ooh, like what? ""The Crown""?
[Message 100] Jamie: ""Downton Abbey""?
[Message 101] Sam: I love historical dramas too!
[Message 102] Alex: Me too!
[Message 103] Jordan: Exactly! Something like that.
[Message 104] River: Have you seen ""Bridgerton""?
[Message 105] Jamie: It's a bit more romanticized, but still fun.
[Message 106] Sam: I enjoyed ""Bridgerton."" Guilty pleasure.
[Message 107] Alex: I've heard mixed reviews about ""Bridgerton.""
[Message 108] Jordan: I'll check it out! Thanks for the recommendation.
[Message 109] River: No problem!
[Message 110] Jamie: You're welcome!
[Message 111] Sam: Anytime!
[Message 112] Alex: Okay, back to art documentaries... Any recommendations specifically about landscape art?
[Message 113] River: Hmm, let me think... I'm not sure about a specific documentary, but maybe look for something about the Hudson River School.
[Message 114] Jamie: Good suggestion, River! They were masters of landscape painting.
[Message 115] Sam: I think there's a PBS series called ""American Masters"" that might have an episode about a landscape artist.
[Message 116] Alex: Great ideas! Thanks again!
[Message 117] Jordan: The Hudson River School... Thomas Cole... beautiful.
[Message 118] River: Definitely!
[Message 119] Jamie: Absolutely!
[Message 120] Sam: Agreed!
[Message 121] Alex: I'm going to dive down a Google rabbit hole now. Landscape art here I come!
[Message 122] River: Have fun!
[Message 123] Jamie: Enjoy!
[Message 124] Sam: Happy searching!
[Message 125] Jordan: Me too!
[Message 126] Alex: Okay, so apparently there's a documentary called ""Rivers and Tides"" about Andy Goldsworthy.
[Message 127] River: Ooh, I've heard of that! He makes incredible ephemeral sculptures in nature.
[Message 128] Jamie: That sounds fascinating!
[Message 129] Sam: I'll add that to my list.
[Message 130] Alex: Me too!
[Message 131] Jordan: Andy Goldsworthy... I'll look him up.
[Message 132] River: You won't be disappointed!
[Message 133] Jamie: Definitely!
[Message 134] Sam: Prepare to be amazed.
[Message 135] Alex: Alright, I think I've got enough art to consume for a while. Thanks everyone for the recommendations!
[Message 136] River: Anytime, Alex!
[Message 137] Jamie: You're very welcome!
[Message 138] Sam: It was fun!
[Message 139] Jordan: My pleasure!
[Message 140] Alex: Anyone doing anything fun this weekend?
[Message 141] River: Probably just gaming. Maybe try out a new RPG.
[Message 142] Jamie: I'm going to try a new baking recipe. Hopefully it turns out edible!
[Message 143] Sam: I'm planning on hitting the beach. Gotta soak up some sun before it gets too cold.
[Message 144] Alex: Beach sounds amazing, Sam! I might try some fishing.
[Message 145] Jordan: Relaxing at home, probably. Maybe some painting.
[Message 146] River: Sounds like a good weekend for everyone!
[Message 147] Jamie: Agreed!
[Message 148] Sam: Definitely!
[Message 149] Jordan: Yup!
[Message 150] Alex: Well, I'm going to head out. Have a great day everyone!
[Message 151] River: You too, Alex!
[Message 152] Jamie: Have a good one, Alex!
[Message 153] Sam: Later, Alex!
[Message 154] Jordan: Bye, Alex!
[Message 155] Alex: Bye!
[Message 156] River: Anyone up for another art chat next week?
[Message 157] Jamie: I'm in!
[Message 158] Sam: Sounds good to me.
[Message 159] Jordan: Sure!
[Message 160] River: Awesome!
[Message 161] Jamie: Great!
[Message 162] Sam: Excellent.
[Message 163] Jordan: Perfect!
[Message 164] River: Have a good day everyone!

105,"[Message 1] Maya: Ugh, can’t believe what happened to Alex!

[Message 2] Ben: Seriously, Maya. It's awful. I still can't wrap my head around this...

[Message 3] Chloe: Me neither. So tragic.

[Message 4] Daniel: Yeah, terrible. Hey Ben, you heading to that coffee shop later?

[Message 5] Ben: Maybe, Daniel. Depends. Why?

[Message 6] Daniel: Just wondering. Haven't seen you in ages.

[Message 7] Ben: Been busy. You know how it is.

[Message 8] Chloe: Busy doing what, Ben? Just curious.

[Message 9] Ben: Just, you know, stuff. Work.

[Message 10] Maya: Chloe, let him be. It's a difficult time for everyone. Did any of you guys know Alex well?

[Message 11] Chloe: I knew him, yeah. He was always so passionate about his activism.

[Message 12] Daniel: I’d seen him around. The manager at his work was always complaining about Alex.

[Message 13] Ben: I knew Alex, yeah. We talked about business sometimes. Nothing serious.

[Message 14] Maya: Business? What kind of business?

[Message 15] Ben: Just… freelance stuff. He was helping me with some web design.

[Message 16] Chloe: Web design? I thought he was focused on activism.

[Message 17] Ben: Yeah, that too. He had a lot on his plate.

[Message 18] Daniel: Did you see Alex the other day Ben?

[Message 19] Ben: Last I saw him was maybe a week ago? Why?

[Message 20] Daniel: Just wondering if you heard him mention anything weird.

[Message 21] Ben: Nope. Nothing weird.

[Message 22] Maya: The police are asking a lot of questions, right?

[Message 23] Chloe: I imagine so. A death like that…

[Message 24] Daniel: Wonder if they have any leads.

[Message 25] Ben: Probably not. These things take time.

[Message 26] Maya: So true.

[Message 27] Chloe: It's just so sad. He was only 40.

[Message 28] Daniel: Life is short, huh?

[Message 29] Ben: Tell me about it.

[Message 30] Maya: Makes you think, doesn't it?

[Message 31] Chloe: Totally. Hey, has anyone spoken to Kai lately?

[Message 32] Daniel: Kai? Why?

[Message 33] Chloe: Just haven't heard from him. He was pretty close to Alex.

[Message 34] Ben: Kai’s probably just grieving.

[Message 35] Maya: Yeah, give him some space.

[Message 36] Daniel: Yeah, i agree with Maya

[Message 37] Chloe: True. I just hope he's okay.

[Message 38] Ben: He will be. He's strong.

[Message 39] Maya: Anyone know what time they found him?

[Message 40] Daniel: I think the news said Mid-Morning.

[Message 41] Ben: Ugh, so early.

[Message 42] Chloe: Horrible.

[Message 43] Maya: I hope they catch whoever did this.

[Message 44] Daniel: Me too. They're going away for a long time for this

[Message 45] Ben: Agreed.

[Message 46] Chloe: Absolutely.

[Message 47] Maya: I'm going to try and get some sleep. This is exhausting.

[Message 48] Daniel: Yeah, same here.

[Message 49] Ben: Night, guys.

[Message 50] Chloe: Goodnight.

[Message 51] Maya: Goodnight.

[Message 52] Chloe: Hey Daniel, you still there?

[Message 53] Daniel: Yeah, Chloe?

[Message 54] Chloe: Did Ben seem weird to you?

[Message 55] Daniel: Weird how?

[Message 56] Chloe: Just… evasive. About when he last saw Alex.

[Message 57] Daniel: Maybe he's just shocked. I saw him leave the building at Mid-Morning that day, but I assumed he was just heading out for lunch.

[Message 58] Chloe: Maybe. I just have this feeling…

[Message 59] Daniel: A feeling about what?

[Message 60] Chloe: Never mind. I'm probably overthinking it.

[Message 61] Daniel: Probably. Get some rest.

[Message 62] Chloe: You too.

[Message 63] Ben: Maya, can I ask you something?

[Message 64] Maya: Sure, Ben. What's up?

[Message 65] Ben: Did Alex ever mention having any enemies?

[Message 66] Maya: Enemies? I don't know… he was an activist. He probably ruffled some feathers. Why?

[Message 67] Ben: Just curious. The manager probably hated him.

[Message 68] Maya: Maybe. But enemies? I don't know.

[Message 69] Ben: Okay. Thanks.

[Message 70] Maya: No problem. You okay?

[Message 71] Ben: Yeah, fine. Just… trying to make sense of things.

[Message 72] Maya: I understand.

[Message 73] Daniel: Hey Chloe, did you hear anything else about Alex?

[Message 74] Chloe: No, nothing new. Just the same reports. Why?

[Message 75] Daniel: I was just thinking… Alex was always so…vocal.

[Message 76] Chloe: Yeah?

[Message 77] Daniel: I always thought he’d get hurt one day with his activism.

[Message 78] Chloe: Maybe. But this… this is different.

[Message 79] Daniel: Yeah, it is.

[Message 80] Maya: Has anyone heard anything from the police? Any updates?

[Message 81] Chloe: Not me.

[Message 82] Daniel: Nope.

[Message 83] Ben: Nothing here either.

[Message 84] Maya: So frustrating.

[Message 85] Chloe: It is.

[Message 86] Daniel: Just gotta be patient, I guess.

[Message 87] Ben: Easier said than done.

[Message 88] Maya: True.

[Message 89] Chloe: What are you guys up to today? Trying to distract myself.

[Message 90] Daniel: Just chilling at home.

[Message 91] Ben: Same.

[Message 92] Maya: Laundry. The glamorous life.

[Message 93] Chloe: Haha. I feel you.

[Message 94] Daniel: Anything on TV?

[Message 95] Ben: Nothing good.

[Message 96] Maya: Always.

[Message 97] Chloe: Okay, I'm gonna go for a walk. Need some fresh air.

[Message 98] Daniel: Good idea.

[Message 99] Ben: Be safe.

[Message 100] Maya: Yeah, be careful Chloe.

[Message 101] Chloe: Will do!

[Message 102] Ben: Maya, one more thing about Alex...

[Message 103] Maya: Yes, Ben?

[Message 104] Ben: Did he ever seem...afraid of anyone?

[Message 105] Maya: Afraid? I don't think so. He was pretty fearless. Why all the questions, Ben?

[Message 106] Ben: Just trying to understand. He always hated Alex. It's just suspicious

[Message 107] Maya: Okay...

[Message 108] Daniel: Hey guys, random question. Anyone know how to unclog a bathtub drain?

[Message 109] Chloe: Seriously, Daniel? Now?

[Message 110] Daniel: What? Just asking. It's clogged.

[Message 111] Ben: Plunger. Or Drano.

[Message 112] Maya: Yeah, Drano is good.

[Message 113] Chloe: Okay... moving on.

[Message 114] Daniel: Sorry, just thought I'd ask.

[Message 115] Ben: No problem.

[Message 116] Maya: So, back to Alex…

[Message 117] Chloe: Can we please talk about something else? I'm getting a headache.

[Message 118] Daniel: Agreed.

[Message 119] Ben: Okay. Whatever.

[Message 120] Maya: Fine. Daniel, how’s that drain coming along?

[Message 121] Daniel: Still working on it. This is a tough one.

[Message 122] Chloe: Maybe you should call a plumber.

[Message 123] Daniel: Maybe.

[Message 124] Ben: Try boiling water. Sometimes that works.

[Message 125] Maya: Good idea, Ben.

[Message 126] Daniel: I'll try that. Thanks.

[Message 127] Chloe: Let us know if it works!

[Message 128] Daniel: Will do.

[Message 129] Ben: So, Chloe, how was the walk?

[Message 130] Chloe: Okay. Just thinking a lot.

[Message 131] Ben: About?

[Message 132] Chloe: Life. Alex. Everything.

[Message 133] Ben: Understandable.

[Message 134] Maya: Yeah, it's a lot to process.

[Message 135] Daniel: Boiling water didn't work. Guess I'm calling a plumber.

[Message 136] Chloe: Sorry to hear that!

[Message 137] Ben: Bummer.

[Message 138] Maya: At least you tried.

[Message 139] Daniel: True.

[Message 140] Chloe: I'm going to make some tea. Anyone want some?

[Message 141] Daniel: Thanks, but I'm good.

[Message 142] Ben: I'm okay, thanks.

106,"[Message 1] CHLOE: OMG, have you guys heard about what happened at Cemetery?

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, it's all over the news. Brutal.

[Message 3] MAYA: I know, right? Two people. So awful. Who were they?

[Message 4] CHLOE: Apparently, it was Alex and Ben.

[Message 5] LIAM: Alex? The journalist? No way!

[Message 6] MAYA: And Ben? The taxi driver? What the heck happened?

[Message 7] CHLOE: No clue. Just heard they were found this Early Morning.

[Message 8] LIAM: Police must be all over it.

[Message 9] MAYA: You think they have any leads?

[Message 10] CHLOE: Hopefully. This is so messed up.

[Message 11] LIAM: Seriously. I saw Alex just last week.

[Message 12] MAYA: Me too! Ben gave me a ride just yesterday.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Crazy. Life is so fragile.

[Message 14] LIAM: Did either of them seem off at all?

[Message 15] MAYA: Ben was his usual self. Joking around.

[Message 16] CHLOE: Alex seemed a little stressed, maybe? But nothing major.

[Message 17] LIAM: Hmmm.

[Message 18] MAYA: What's up, Liam?

[Message 19] LIAM: Nothing, just thinking.

[Message 20] CHLOE: Okay... Anyway, this whole thing is freaking me out.

[Message 21] MAYA: Tell me about it. I'm locking all my doors tonight.

[Message 22] LIAM: Smart move.

[Message 23] CHLOE: Hey, did either of you guys know Alex well?

[Message 24] LIAM: Just casually. We'd grab coffee sometimes.

[Message 25] MAYA: I only knew Ben as my regular driver. He was always super nice.

[Message 26] CHLOE: Right.

[Message 27] LIAM: So, Maya, you saw Ben just yesterday, huh?

[Message 28] MAYA: Yeah, why?

[Message 29] LIAM: Just wondering what time.

[Message 30] MAYA: Uh, around 7 PM? He dropped me off at my place.

[Message 31] LIAM: Okay. Just curious.

[Message 32] CHLOE: You being questioned, Liam?

[Message 33] LIAM: Nah, just trying to piece things together, you know?

[Message 34] MAYA: I get it.

[Message 35] CHLOE: This is going to be all anyone talks about for weeks.

[Message 36] LIAM: Definitely.

[Message 37] MAYA: I wonder if they were targeted.

[Message 38] CHLOE: Seems likely, right? Two people?

[Message 39] LIAM: Maybe a robbery gone wrong?

[Message 40] MAYA: Maybe. But why two victims?

[Message 41] CHLOE: Good point.

[Message 42] LIAM: Maybe Alex's journalism work had something to do with it?

[Message 43] MAYA: Could be. He was working on that big story about the corruption thing.

[Message 44] CHLOE: Oh yeah! I remember him mentioning that. Scary.

[Message 45] LIAM: Wonder if the cops are looking into that angle.

[Message 46] MAYA: They have to be, right?

[Message 47] CHLOE: I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 48] LIAM: Agreed.

[Message 49] MAYA: I feel so bad for their families.

[Message 50] CHLOE: Me too.

[Message 51] LIAM: Well, I'm going to try and get some sleep. This has been a long day.

[Message 52] MAYA: Same here. Night, guys.

[Message 53] CHLOE: Night.

[Message 54] LIAM: Night.

[Message 55] MAYA: (Next Day) Hey guys, anything new on the case?

[Message 56] CHLOE: Not that I've heard. Still pretty quiet.

[Message 57] LIAM: Nothing here either.

[Message 58] MAYA: Ugh, the waiting is the worst.

[Message 59] CHLOE: Tell me about it. I keep refreshing the news.

[Message 60] LIAM: Maybe we should all just try to distract ourselves.

[Message 61] MAYA: Good idea. Movie night?

[Message 62] CHLOE: I'm in. Liam?

[Message 63] LIAM: Can't tonight. Got something going on.

[Message 64] MAYA: Oh, okay.

[Message 65] CHLOE: All good. Maybe another time.

[Message 66] LIAM: Yeah, definitely.

[Message 67] MAYA: So, just you and me, Chloe?

[Message 68] CHLOE: Yep!

[Message 69] MAYA: Cool. What should we watch?

[Message 70] CHLOE: Doesn't matter to me. Anything but a thriller, haha.

[Message 71] MAYA: Deal.

[Message 72] LIAM: I saw this crazy article about bathtubs the other day.

[Message 73] MAYA: Bathtubs? What's crazy about bathtubs?

[Message 74] LIAM: Just weird facts, like how much water they hold and stuff. Random.

[Message 75] CHLOE: Okay...

[Message 76] MAYA: You okay, Liam? You seem a bit… off.

[Message 77] LIAM: Just tired, I think.

[Message 78] CHLOE: Right.

[Message 79] MAYA: Well, get some rest.

[Message 80] LIAM: Will do. You guys have fun tonight.

[Message 81] CHLOE: Thanks!

[Message 82] MAYA: We will!

[Message 83] CHLOE: (Later that night) Maya, did Liam seem weird to you?

[Message 84] MAYA: Yeah, totally. He’s been acting strange since we started talking about Alex and Ben.

[Message 85] CHLOE: I know! Like he’s hiding something.

[Message 86] MAYA: Maybe we’re just being paranoid.

[Message 87] CHLOE: Maybe. But it’s worth keeping an eye on him.

[Message 88] MAYA: Agreed.

[Message 89] LIAM: (Next Day) Hey, guys. Sorry I missed movie night.

[Message 90] CHLOE: No worries.

[Message 91] MAYA: All good.

[Message 92] LIAM: Anything new on the case?

[Message 93] CHLOE: Still nothing.

[Message 94] MAYA: Just the usual speculation.

[Message 95] LIAM: Right.

[Message 96] CHLOE: You seem really interested, Liam.

[Message 97] LIAM: Just concerned, you know? It’s scary.

[Message 98] MAYA: Yeah, it is.

[Message 99] CHLOE: I heard Alex had enemies, maybe even people who hated him.

[Message 100] LIAM: Did you now? Who told you that?

[Message 101] CHLOE: Just heard it through the grapevine. People who didn't like his articles.

[Message 102] MAYA: I bet. Journalism can be a dangerous job.

[Message 103] LIAM: True.

[Message 104] CHLOE: It's probably nothing.

[Message 105] LIAM: Probably not.

[Message 106] MAYA: Hey, I saw a long eyelashes walking away from the Cemetery that day. Weird, right?

[Message 107] CHLOE: Yeah, that's strange.

[Message 108] LIAM: Early Morning are the worst time to go to the cemetery.

[Message 109] CHLOE: Agreed.

[Message 110] MAYA: Should we tell the cops?

[Message 111] CHLOE: Probably a good idea.

[Message 112] LIAM: Yeah, you should definitely do that, Maya.

[Message 113] MAYA: I will.

[Message 114] CHLOE: So, Liam, what were you doing last night? The whole night.

[Message 115] LIAM: Just chilling at home. Watching TV.

[Message 116] CHLOE: All night?

[Message 117] LIAM: Pretty much. Why?

[Message 118] CHLOE: No reason. Just making conversation.

[Message 119] MAYA: Okay… this is getting awkward.

[Message 120] LIAM: Yeah, it is. I’m gonna go.

[Message 121] CHLOE: Later.

[Message 122] MAYA: Bye.

[Message 123] CHLOE: Okay, Maya, we need to talk.

[Message 124] MAYA: I know, right? Liam is definitely hiding something.

[Message 125] CHLOE: Yeah. He seemed so… eager to get you to tell the police about the eyelashes. Like he wanted to steer the investigation.

[Message 126] MAYA: True. And he was asking about my time with Ben right after it happened.

[Message 127] CHLOE: We need to be careful.

[Message 128] MAYA: Agreed. But what if we're wrong?

[Message 129] CHLOE: Even if we are, it's better to be safe than sorry.

[Message 130] MAYA: True.

[Message 131] CHLOE: We should check his social media. See if anything seems off.

[Message 132] MAYA: Good idea. I’ll start digging.

[Message 133] CHLOE: Let me know what you find.

[Message 134] MAYA: Will do.

[Message 135] MAYA: (Later) Chloe, I found something!

[Message 136] CHLOE: What is it?

[Message 137] MAYA: He was researching… journalist ethics? And taxi driving routes?

[Message 138] CHLOE: What? Why would he be doing that?

[Message 139] MAYA: I don’t know! But it’s weird, right?

[Message 140] CHLOE: Super weird. This is getting more and more suspicious.

[Message 141] MAYA: Tell me about it.

[Message 142] CHLOE: We need to go to the police.

[Message 143] MAYA: Are you sure?

[Message 144] CHLOE: Yes. This is too much to ignore.

[Message 145] MAYA: Okay. Let’s do it.

[Message 146] CHLOE: Tomorrow morning?

[Message 147] MAYA: Perfect.

[Message 148] LIAM: (Later that night) Hey guys, just checking in. Everything okay?

[Message 149] CHLOE: Yeah, fine.

[Message 150] MAYA: All good here.

[Message 151] LIAM: Just wanted to make sure. This whole thing has me on edge.

[Message 152] CHLOE: Right.

[Message 153] MAYA: Me too.

[Message 154] LIAM: Well, good night. Sleep well.

[Message 155] CHLOE: You too.

[Message 156] MAYA: Night.

[Message 157] CHLOE: (To Maya, privately) He's definitely trying to act normal.

[Message 158] MAYA: I know. It's so obvious now.

[Message 159] CHLOE: We did the right thing.

[Message 160] MAYA: I hope so.

[Message 161] LIAM: Guys? You there?

[Message 162] CHLOE: Yes. What's up?

[Message 163] LIAM: Just having trouble sleeping. Keep thinking about Alex. All those times he talked about getting rid of someone.

[Message 164] MAYA: Really?

[Message 165] LIAM: Yeah. He was always saying someone was out to get him.

[Message 166] CHLOE: He did seem paranoid sometimes.

[Message 167] LIAM: Maybe it wasn't just paranoia.

[Message 168] MAYA: Maybe not.

[Message 169] LIAM: Anyway, just wanted to share that. Good night for real this time.

[Message 170] CHLOE: Night.

[Message 171] MAYA: Night.

[Message 172] CHLOE: (To Maya) Did he really say that about Alex?

[Message 173] MAYA: I don't remember him ever saying that.

[Message 174] CHLOE: Me neither. He's definitely trying to frame Alex.

[Message 175] MAYA: Let's get some sleep. Tomorrow, we tell the police everything.",1,

[Message 3] Alex: Same here, Jamie. But the company is great! So, what’s everyone’s week looking like? Any exciting goals you’re chasing?
[Message 4] Mateo: Exciting goals… well, I’m trying to finally learn that salsa routine properly. I signed up for a class.
[Message 5] Jamie: Salsa? That's awesome, Mateo! I always wanted to learn to dance.
[Message 6] Alex: That sounds fun! I’m trying to finish the first draft of a short story I've been working on.
[Message 7] Mateo: A short story? What’s it about, Alex?
[Message 8] Alex: It's a bit of sci-fi, nothing too serious. More character-focused.
[Message 9] Jamie: I'm impressed! Writing is something I admire. I'm just trying to get back into my cooking groove. I've been feeling uninspired lately.
[Message 10] Mateo: Maybe try a new cuisine, Jamie? That always helps me with dancing when I feel stuck.
[Message 11] Jamie: Good idea, Mateo! I might try Vietnamese. I've always been intimidated by it.
[Message 12] Alex: Ooh, Vietnamese is delicious! And their vegetarian options are amazing.
[Message 13] Mateo: Okay, now I'm hungry. Anyone want to grab some pho after this?
[Message 14] Jamie: I'm in! Alex?
[Message 15] Alex: Sounds good to me. Gotta finish this spare first, though. (Or at least try to.)
[Message 16] Mateo: Haha, good luck with that! So, Jamie, what kind of cooking are you thinking of getting into specifically?
[Message 17] Jamie: I was thinking maybe some traditional Vietnamese dishes like Bún chả or Phở cuốn. Something challenging!
[Message 18] Alex: Those are both great choices! Bún chả can be a little tricky with the grilling, but it's worth it.
[Message 19] Mateo: Grilling? Now you're talking my language! I love a good barbecue.
[Message 20] Jamie: Mateo, you’d be the perfect grilling sous chef!
[Message 21] Mateo: I’m available for hire! Though my rates are very reasonable… like free food.
[Message 22] Alex: Free food is always a good rate. What about you, Mateo? Any performances coming up?
[Message 23] Mateo: Not yet, but the salsa class is for a reason! I’m hoping to audition for a local dance group in a couple of months.
[Message 24] Jamie: That’s exciting! I’m sure you’ll nail it!
[Message 25] Alex: I agree! You’ve got the moves, Mateo.
[Message 26] Mateo: Thanks, guys! I appreciate the encouragement. It's definitely a bit nerve-wracking.
[Message 27] Jamie: Nerves are natural! Just channel them into energy.
[Message 28] Alex: Exactly! Think of it as excitement instead of fear.
[Message 29] Mateo: Good point. Easier said than done, but I’ll try.
[Message 30] Jamie: So, Alex, how’s the writing going? Any roadblocks?
[Message 31] Alex: It's going… slowly. Writer’s block has been a frequent visitor lately.
[Message 32] Mateo: Ugh, I hate writer’s block. Maybe try changing your environment?
[Message 33] Jamie: Or try writing something completely different, just for fun?
[Message 34] Alex: I've tried a few different things. Maybe I just need to take a break and come back to it with fresh eyes.
[Message 35] Mateo: That’s probably a good idea. Sometimes distance helps.
[Message 36] Jamie: Definitely. Speaking of breaks, how about another round of bowling?
[Message 37] Alex: I'm game! Maybe I'll actually break 100 this time.
[Message 38] Mateo: Let's do it! I’m feeling lucky.
[Message 39] Jamie: Don’t get too confident, Mateo!
[Message 40] Mateo: Never! Confidence is key… even when it's misplaced.
[Message 41] Alex: Haha, I like that attitude. Alright, let's go!
[Message 42] Jamie: Coming!
[Message 43] Mateo: (Later, after another round) Okay, my arm is officially sore. Time for pho?
[Message 44] Alex: Definitely pho time. I'm starving.
[Message 45] Jamie: Lead the way!
[Message 46] Mateo: Alright, I know a great place just a few blocks from here. Let's go!
[Message 47] Alex: Perfect!
[Message 48] Jamie: Sounds wonderful!
[Message 49] Mateo: So, anyone have anything interesting planned for the weekend?
[Message 50] Jamie: I'm hoping to visit the farmer's market. I need to find some fresh ingredients for my Vietnamese cooking experiment.
[Message 51] Alex: Ooh, that sounds fun! I might just relax and catch up on some reading.
[Message 52] Mateo: I'm thinking of going for a hike. Need to get some fresh air and clear my head.
[Message 53] Jamie: A hike sounds lovely! Where are you thinking of going?
[Message 54] Mateo: Probably up to Ensign Peak. It's a pretty easy hike with a great view of the city.
[Message 55] Alex: That's a good choice! I haven't been up there in ages.
[Message 56] Jamie: Maybe I'll join you guys sometime!
[Message 57] Mateo: Definitely! The more the merrier.
[Message 58] Alex: Agreed!
[Message 59] Mateo: So, Jamie, any particular dish you're planning to tackle first?
[Message 60] Jamie: I think I'm going to start with Phở cuốn. It seems a little less intimidating than Bún chả.
[Message 61] Alex: Good choice! It's delicious and relatively easy to make.
[Message 62] Mateo: I'm just excited to taste the results!
[Message 63] Jamie: Haha, I'll be sure to share!
[Message 64] Alex: Speaking of sharing, I might try baking some cookies this weekend.
[Message 65] Mateo: Cookies? You're speaking my language again!
[Message 66] Jamie: What kind of cookies?
[Message 67] Alex: I was thinking maybe some chocolate chip or peanut butter cookies.
[Message 68] Mateo: Both sound amazing!
[Message 69] Jamie: I love a good peanut butter cookie!
[Message 70] Alex: I'll definitely bring some next time we hang out.
[Message 71] Mateo: Awesome! You're the best, Alex.
[Message 72] Jamie: We are being spoiled!
[Message 73] Alex: Just happy to share!
[Message 74] Mateo: Okay, enough about food. Let's talk about something else... like dancing!
[Message 75] Jamie: Oh, here we go!
[Message 76] Alex: Haha, I was wondering when you'd bring it up again.
[Message 77] Mateo: I can't help it! I'm passionate about dancing.
[Message 78] Jamie: I admire your passion!
[Message 79] Alex: Me too! It's great to have something you love.
[Message 80] Mateo: So, any interest in learning a few basic salsa steps?
[Message 81] Jamie: Maybe... someday.
[Message 82] Alex: I'm pretty clumsy, but I'm willing to give it a try sometime.
[Message 83] Mateo: Awesome! I can teach you guys a few basic steps. It's easier than you think.
[Message 84] Jamie: We'll see!
[Message 85] Alex: I'm always up for trying new things.
[Message 86] Mateo: That's the spirit!
[Message 87] Jamie: Speaking of new things, did either of you hear about that new exhibit at the art museum?
[Message 88] Alex: I did! I was thinking of checking it out next week.
[Message 89] Mateo: What's it about?
[Message 90] Jamie: It's a collection of contemporary sculptures.
[Message 91] Alex: Sounds interesting!
[Message 92] Mateo: I'm not usually a big fan of sculptures, but I might give it a try.
[Message 93] Jamie: You never know, you might be surprised!
[Message 94] Alex: Exactly!
[Message 95] Mateo: True. Okay, I'm officially open to the idea of visiting the art museum.
[Message 96] Jamie: Hooray!
[Message 97] Alex: We'll make an art enthusiast out of you yet!
[Message 98] Mateo: Don't get your hopes up too high!
[Message 99] Jamie: Never say never!
[Message 100] Alex: So, what time are we meeting for pho?
[Message 101] Mateo: How about in fifteen minutes? That should give us enough time to get there.
[Message 102] Jamie: Sounds good to me!
[Message 103] Alex: Perfect!
[Message 104] Mateo: Alright, let's get going!
[Message 105] Jamie: Lead the way!
[Message 106] Alex: Coming!
[Message 107] Mateo: (Later, at the pho restaurant) Ah, this smells amazing!
[Message 108] Jamie: I agree! I'm so hungry.
[Message 109] Alex: Me too! I could eat a whole cow right now.
[Message 110] Mateo: Haha, I'm glad we all agree.
[Message 111] Jamie: So, Alex, anything exciting happening at work lately?
[Message 112] Alex: Actually, I have a job interview next week.
[Message 113] Mateo: Oh, wow! That's great! What's the job?
[Message 114] Jamie: Good luck!
[Message 115] Alex: It's another data analyst position, but this one seems a bit more challenging and interesting.
[Message 116] Mateo: Sounds promising!
[Message 117] Jamie: I hope you get it!
[Message 118] Alex: Thanks! I'm a little nervous, but also excited.
[Message 119] Mateo: Nerves are good! Just channel them like Jamie said.
[Message 120] Jamie: Exactly! You’ve got this! What kind of company is it?
[Message 121] Alex: It's a tech company that focuses on renewable energy.
[Message 122] Mateo: That's really cool!
[Message 123] Jamie: I'm impressed!
[Message 124] Alex: Yeah, I'm really interested in their mission.
[Message 125] Mateo: Well, I'm sure you'll do great! Just be yourself and highlight your skills.
[Message 126] Jamie: And don’t forget to ask questions! It shows you’re engaged.
[Message 127] Alex: Good point! I always forget to ask questions.
[Message 128] Mateo: Prepare a few beforehand so you don't blank out.
[Message 129] Jamie: I always have a few written down! It makes me feel more confident.
[Message 130] Alex: That's a great idea! I'll definitely do that.
[Message 131] Mateo: You got this, Alex!
[Message 132] Jamie: We’re rooting for you!
[Message 133] Alex: Thanks, guys! I really appreciate the support.
[Message 134] Mateo: Anytime!
[Message 135] Jamie: You're welcome!
[Message 136] Alex: This pho is really hitting the spot.
[Message 137] Mateo: I know, right? It's the perfect comfort food.
[Message 138] Jamie: Especially on a chilly evening like this.
[Message 139] Alex: Agreed!
[Message 140] Mateo: So, after this, anyone up for grabbing some dessert?
[Message 141] Jamie: I'm always up for dessert!
[Message 142] Alex: Me too!
[Message 143] Mateo: Perfect! I know a great ice cream place nearby.
[Message 144] Jamie: Ooh, ice cream sounds amazing!
[Message 145] Alex: Let's do it!
[Message 146] Mateo: Alright, dessert it is!
[Message 147] Jamie: Wonderful!
[Message 148] Alex: Can't wait!
[Message 149] Mateo: This has been a really fun night.
[Message 150] Jamie: I agree! It's always great to hang out with you guys.
[Message 151] Alex: Me too! I'm glad we made plans to get together.
[Message 152] Mateo: We should definitely do this again soon.
[Message 153] Jamie: Absolutely!
[Message 154] Alex: Agreed!
[Message 155] Mateo: Maybe next time we can try a different activity.
[Message 156] Jamie: Like what?
[Message 157] Alex: Maybe we could go see a movie or try a new restaurant.
[Message 158] Mateo: Or maybe we could actually go hiking!
[Message 159] Jamie: That sounds fun!
[Message 160] Alex: I'm in!
[Message 161] Mateo: Alright, hiking it is! We'll plan a hiking trip for next time.
[Message 162] Jamie: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 163] Alex: Awesome!
[Message 164] Mateo: Okay, let's finish up our pho and head to the ice cream place.
[Message 165] Jamie: Sounds good!
[Message 166] Alex: Let's go!
[Message 167] Mateo: To ice cream!
[Message 168] Jamie: To ice cream!
[Message 169] Alex: To ice cream!
[Message 170] Mateo: (After finishing the pho) Alright, let's go get some ice cream!
[Message 171] Jamie: I’m ready!
[Message 172] Alex: Let’s do it!
[Message 173] Mateo: So, what flavor are you guys thinking of getting?
[Message 174] Jamie: I’m thinking something fruity. Maybe raspberry sorbet?
[Message 175] Alex: I might go for chocolate chip cookie dough.
[Message 176] Mateo: I’m torn between mint chocolate chip and peanut butter cup.
[Message 177] Jamie: Tough choice!
[Message 178] Alex: Both are delicious!
[Message 179] Mateo: I know! I’ll probably just flip a coin.
[Message 180] Jamie: Haha, good luck!
[Message 181] Alex: Maybe get a scoop of each?
[Message 182] Mateo: Now there's an idea!
[Message 183] Jamie: Problem solved!
[Message 184] Mateo: Alright, let's go get our ice cream!
[Message 185] Jamie: Onward!
[Message 186] Alex: To deliciousness!
[Message 187] Mateo: This was a perfect Salt Lake City night.
[Message 188] Jamie: Absolutely! Thanks for suggesting this, Mateo!
[Message 189] Alex: Yeah, thanks Mateo!
[Message 190] Mateo: Anytime, guys! Always happy to hang out.",0,

109,"[Message 1] Jamie: Hey guys, heard about what happened at Warehouse? Awful.
[Message 2] Kai: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. Greenville PD must be going nuts.
[Message 3] Riley: Seriously. I was just there yesterday getting coffee.
[Message 4] Jamie: Did you know either of them?
[Message 5] Riley: Nah, not personally. Heard whispers about a new judge, Mrs. Eleanor Vance. And I think a Corrections Officer named Melissa, maybe?
[Message 6] Kai: Eleanor Vance? Damn. She ruled on my brother's case last year.
[Message 7] Jamie: Oh wow, small world.
[Message 8] Riley: What was she like?
[Message 9] Kai: Cynical. That's the only word for it. Didn't seem to care about anyone.
[Message 10] Jamie: I'm just shocked something like this happened here.
[Message 11] Riley: Me too. Anyone know any details?
[Message 12] Kai: Just what's on the news. Stabbing with a knife. Brutal.
[Message 13] Jamie: Ugh, graphic. Makes me sick.
[Message 14] Riley: Speaking of sick, I think I'm catching a cold. Gonna grab some soup.
[Message 15] Kai: Feel better!
[Message 16] Jamie: Yeah, get some rest.
[Message 17] Riley: Thanks, guys.
[Message 18] Kai: Jamie, you working tonight?
[Message 19] Jamie: No, thankfully. Day off. Why?
[Message 20] Kai: Just curious. I'm picking up a shift at the diner.
[Message 21] Jamie: Make that bread!
[Message 22] Kai: Trying to! Bills are killer.
[Message 23] Jamie: Tell me about it.
[Message 24] Riley: (Later) Guys, I can't sleep. Still thinking about those murders.
[Message 25] Jamie: Me too, Riley. It's messing with my head.
[Message 26] Kai: Maybe we should all get together tomorrow, take our minds off it?
[Message 27] Riley: That sounds good. Movie night?
[Message 28] Jamie: I'm in. I'll bring the popcorn.
[Message 29] Kai: I can grab some drinks. What time?
[Message 30] Riley: How about 7?
[Message 31] Jamie: Perfect.
[Message 32] Kai: Cool. See you then.
[Message 33] Riley: Night!
[Message 34] Jamie: Night guys.
[Message 35] Kai: (Next day) Hey, did either of you know Melissa personally?
[Message 36] Jamie: I think I've seen her around, maybe at the gym? Why?
[Message 37] Kai: Just wondering. Heard she and Eleanor Vance might have been involved somehow. Maybe romantically.
[Message 38] Riley: Woah, really? Where did you hear that?
[Message 39] Kai: Just rumors, you know how Greenville is. Everyone knows everyone's business.
[Message 40] Jamie: True. But that's a serious rumor.
[Message 41] Riley: Yeah, be careful spreading stuff like that.
[Message 42] Kai: I'm not spreading anything, just repeating what I heard.
[Message 43] Jamie: Right, right. So, movie night still on?
[Message 44] Kai: Yep! Just finishing up at work.
[Message 45] Riley: Cool. I'm picking up some candy.
[Message 46] Jamie: Awesome. See you guys soon.
[Message 47] Kai: Later.
[Message 48] Riley: Later!
[Message 49] Jamie: (Later that night) Hey, everything okay, Kai? You seem a little off.
[Message 50] Kai: Just tired. Long day.
[Message 51] Riley: Yeah, you seem distant. Something on your mind?
[Message 52] Kai: Nah, just the murders, I guess. It's a lot to process.
[Message 53] Jamie: I get it. Me too.
[Message 54] Riley: We're here if you need to talk, Kai.
[Message 55] Kai: Thanks, guys. I appreciate that.
[Message 56] Jamie: So, who wants more popcorn?
[Message 57] Riley: Me!
[Message 58] Kai: I'm good.
[Message 59] Jamie: Suit yourself.
[Message 60] Riley: (The next day) Okay, has anyone heard any updates?
[Message 61] Jamie: Nothing new on the news.
[Message 62] Kai: My brother said the cops are looking at everyone who worked at the Warehouse.
[Message 63] Riley: Well, that makes sense. Gotta start somewhere.
[Message 64] Jamie: Did you ever work there, Kai?
[Message 65] Kai: Briefly, a few years back. Why?
[Message 66] Jamie: No reason, just curious.
[Message 67] Riley: I heard they found a Stabbing with a knife.
[Message 68] Jamie: Damn. That's rough.
[Message 69] Kai: Yeah, they're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 70] Riley: Hope they catch whoever did it soon.
[Message 71] Jamie: Me too. This whole thing is unsettling.
[Message 72] Kai: Tell me about it.
[Message 73] Riley: Anyone else have a weird feeling about all this?
[Message 74] Jamie: Weird how?
[Message 75] Riley: I don't know, just…off.
[Message 76] Kai: Maybe we're just on edge.
[Message 77] Jamie: Probably.
[Message 78] Riley: So, anyone doing anything fun this weekend?
[Message 79] Jamie: Thinking of hitting up the art museum.
[Message 80] Kai: Cool. I might just chill at home.
[Message 81] Riley: Sounds relaxing.
[Message 82] Jamie: Yeah, recharge the batteries.
[Message 83] Kai: Exactly.
[Message 84] Riley: Gotta run, errands to do. Talk later!
[Message 85] Jamie: Bye!
[Message 86] Kai: Later!
[Message 87] Jamie: (Later that day) Hey Kai, random question – you ever get the feeling someone is watching you?
[Message 88] Kai: Sometimes, yeah. Paranoid, maybe. Why?
[Message 89] Jamie: Just wondering. I keep seeing this same car parked down the street.
[Message 90] Kai: Could be anyone. Don't sweat it.
[Message 91] Jamie: Easier said than done.
[Message 92] Kai: Maybe you should report it to the police.
[Message 93] Jamie: Nah, I'm probably just being dramatic.
[Message 94] Kai: True.
[Message 95] Riley: (Next morning) Guys, I had the worst nightmare last night.
[Message 96] Jamie: About the murders?
[Message 97] Riley: Yeah, it was so vivid.
[Message 98] Kai: Nightmares are the worst.
[Message 99] Jamie: I hate them.
[Message 100] Riley: Me too.
[Message 101] Kai: Did you guys hear that the Eleanor Vance was known as very Cynical?
[Message 102] Jamie: Who would kill those woman?
[Message 103] Riley: Exactly!
[Message 104] Kai: Anyway, hope you feel better today.
[Message 105] Jamie: Me too.
[Message 106] Riley: Thanks, guys.
[Message 107] Jamie: So, anyone doing anything interesting today?
[Message 108] Kai: Probably just laundry. Exciting, I know.
[Message 109] Riley: The epitome of excitement.
[Message 110] Jamie: I'm gonna try to finish that painting I started.
[Message 111] Kai: Nice! You're so creative.
[Message 112] Riley: Show us when you're done!
[Message 113] Jamie: Will do!
[Message 114] Kai: Gotta run, laundry calls.
[Message 115] Jamie: Bye!
[Message 116] Riley: Later!
[Message 117] Kai: (Later that afternoon) Hey, you guys free to talk? I'm feeling really stressed.
[Message 118] Jamie: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 119] Riley: I'm here. What's going on?
[Message 120] Kai: I just... I heard something that's really bothering me.
[Message 121] Jamie: What is it?
[Message 122] Kai: Someone said… someone said I looked ""relieved"" after the news broke about Eleanor Vance and Melissa.
[Message 123] Riley: Who said that?
[Message 124] Kai: Doesn't matter. The point is, it's making me look suspicious.
[Message 125] Jamie: That's ridiculous. People are just talking.
[Message 126] Riley: Yeah, ignore them.
[Message 127] Kai: Easy for you to say. You're not the one being scrutinized.
[Message 128] Jamie: I know, but you can't let it get to you.
[Message 129] Riley: Exactly. Don't give them the satisfaction.
[Message 130] Kai: But what if they start digging? What if they find something?
[Message 131] Jamie: Find what? You didn't do anything wrong, did you?
[Message 132] Kai: Of course not! But… people talk. Things get twisted.
[Message 133] Riley: Just stay calm and cooperate with the police if they contact you.
[Message 134] Jamie: Yeah, that's all you can do.
[Message 135] Kai: I guess you're right.
[Message 136] Riley: We're here for you, Kai. Don't forget that.
[Message 137] Jamie: Always.
[Message 138] Kai: Thanks, guys. I really needed to hear that.
[Message 139] Riley: Anytime.
[Message 140] Jamie: So, wanna watch a cheesy movie to take your mind off things?
[Message 141] Kai: That actually sounds amazing.
[Message 142] Riley: I'm in! Pizza's on me.
[Message 143] Jamie: Score!
[Message 144] Kai: You guys are the best.
[Message 145] Riley: We know.
[Message 146] Jamie: Haha. So, 7 again?
[Message 147] Kai: Perfect.
[Message 148] Riley: See you then!
[Message 149] Jamie: Later!
[Message 150] Kai: (A few days later) Hey guys, I need to tell you something. It's about Afternoon, the day of the murders.
[Message 151] Jamie: What about it?
[Message 152] Riley: This is serious, right?
[Message 153] Kai: I saw Jamie leaving the Warehouse around Afternoon. She had a bag with her.
[Message 154] Jamie: What?! That's a lie!
[Message 155] Riley: Jamie, is this true?
[Message 156] Jamie: No! I was at the art supply store all Afternoon. I was buying Stabbing with a knife for a project!
[Message 157] Kai: Why didn't you say anything before?
[Message 158] Jamie: Because it's none of your business! And I didn't think it was relevant!
[Message 159] Riley: Jamie, you need to tell the police this.
[Message 160] Jamie: I will, but Kai is making it sound like I'm guilty!
[Message 161] Kai: I'm just saying what I saw. I didn't know what to think.
[Message 162] Riley: Okay, everyone calm down. We need to think rationally.
[Message 163] Jamie: He knew I wanted to get rid of the Corrections Officer because she treated me like dirt.
[Message 164] Jamie: Kai, why are you doing this?
[Message 165] Kai: I told you, I just want to be honest. I should have stopped the murders from even happening.
[Message 166] Riley: Jamie, do you have any proof you were at the art supply store?
[Message 167] Jamie: I have the receipt! I can show you!
[Message 168] Kai: What kind of sicko needs that type of Stabbing with a knife?

[Message 2] Maya: ""Hey Alex! It was beautiful, but definitely a budget-buster, haha.""
[Message 3] Alex: ""I can imagine! Weddings are expensive. Did they at least have good food?""
[Message 4] Maya: ""The food was amazing! But seriously, thinking about my own finances makes my head spin after seeing all that extravagance.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Tell me about it. I'm trying to figure out my retirement savings. It's daunting.""
[Message 6] Maya: ""Retirement? Wow, you're thinking ahead! I'm just trying to survive paycheck to paycheck at '23'!""
[Message 7] Alex: ""It comes sooner than you think, '23' is just a number! Have you looked into budgeting apps?""
[Message 8] Maya: ""I've downloaded a few, but I haven't really committed to using them. Any recommendations?""
[Message 9] Alex: ""I like Mint. It's pretty user-friendly. Or YNAB - You Need A Budget, but it's a bit more involved.""
[Message 10] Maya: ""YNAB... sounds intimidating! Maybe I'll stick with Mint. Thanks!""
[Message 11] Alex: ""No problem! Small steps are better than none. Are you saving for anything specific right now?""
[Message 12] Maya: ""Just trying to pay off some student loans, honestly. The joy of adulthood!""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Ah, the classic struggle. I hear you. Maybe look into refinancing those?""
[Message 14] Maya: ""That's a good idea, I haven't thought about that. I'll do some research.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Definitely worth checking out. Hey, did you see the Mariners game last night?""
[Message 16] Maya: ""Mariners? Nah, I was recovering from all the wedding cake! How'd they do?""
[Message 17] Alex: ""They won! It was a close one, though. Anyway, back to finances, have you considered investing at all?""
[Message 18] Maya: ""Investing? That sounds like something for rich people, haha.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Not necessarily! There are apps like Acorns that invest your spare change.""
[Message 20] Maya: ""Spare change investing? That's actually kind of cool. I'll look into that too.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""It adds up over time! Think of it as a very slow-growing money tree.""
[Message 22] Maya: ""Haha, I like that analogy! Okay, you've inspired me. I'm going to actually try to get my finances in order.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""That's the spirit! What's your first step?""
[Message 24] Maya: ""Download Mint, and look into refinancing my loans.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Solid plan! Just be sure to shop around for the best refinance rates.""
[Message 26] Maya: ""Will do! Thanks for the tips, Alex! You're a lifesaver.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Anytime, Maya! We all need a little financial guidance sometimes. Speaking of which, have you set up a 401k through work?""
[Message 28] Maya: ""I have, but I'm not contributing much. I should probably increase that, right?""

[Message 5] David: It's messed up, that's for sure. You guys going to the vigil tomorrow?

[Message 8] Liam: I might go. Depends.
[Message 9] David: I'll be there. Need to show support.
[Message 10] Chloe: Good for you, David.
[Message 11] Liam: Speaking of support, Maya, did you ever get that car fixed?
[Message 12] Maya: Not yet, Liam. Mechanic quoted me a fortune.
[Message 13] Liam: Bummer. I know a guy, might be able to give you a better deal.
[Message 14] Maya: Really? That would be amazing!
[Message 15] David: I saw Kai buying Hitting with a golf club at the store the other day. Thought it was weird.
[Message 16] Chloe: Hitting with a golf club? Maybe they just took up golf.
[Message 17] David: At that store? Doubt it.
[Message 18] Liam: Don't go pointing fingers, David. You don't know anything.
[Message 19] David: Just saying what I saw.
[Message 20] Maya: Let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 21] Chloe: Yeah, David, be careful what you say.
[Message 22] Liam: He was talking about hurting Alex right before he went over there
[Message 23] David: You okay, Liam? You seem on edge.
[Message 24] Liam: I'm fine. Just tired.
[Message 25] Maya: You seem defensive, Liam. Everything alright?
[Message 26] Liam: Of course. Why wouldn't it be?

[Message 28] Liam: Yeah, he's pretty good. I'll give him a call tomorrow.
[Message 29] Maya: Thanks so much, Liam!
[Message 30] David: Did anyone know Alex or Jordan?
[Message 31] Chloe: Not really. Just saw them around.
[Message 32] Liam: I knew Alex a little bit.
[Message 33] Maya: Oh really? From where?
[Message 34] Liam: Just around. We talked a couple times.
[Message 35] David: He always hated Alex.
[Message 36] Chloe: This is getting morbid. Let's change the subject.
[Message 37] Liam: Agreed. Who wants pizza tonight?
[Message 38] Maya: I'm in!
[Message 39] David: Sure, why not.
[Message 40] Chloe: I'm good. Thanks though.
[Message 41] Liam: Okay, pizza at my place then? 7 PM?

[Message 45] Liam: Later, Chloe.
[Message 46] Maya: Later!
[Message 47] David: Later.
[Message 48] Maya: Hey, did anyone see that new superhero movie?
[Message 49] Liam: Yeah, it was awesome! The special effects were insane.
[Message 50] David: I thought it was okay. Overhyped.
[Message 51] Chloe: I haven't seen it yet. Maybe I'll rent it.
[Message 52] Maya: You should! It's really good.
[Message 53] Liam: What about that documentary on Netflix? The one about the bees?
[Message 54] David: I watched that. Pretty interesting.
[Message 55] Chloe: Bees, huh? I'll add it to my list.
[Message 56] Maya: I'm more of a true crime documentary person myself.
[Message 57] Liam: Speaking of which... this whole Hiking Trail thing is like something out of a movie.
[Message 58] David: Yeah, except it's real life. And people are dead.
[Message 59] Chloe: Let's please not talk about it anymore.
[Message 60] Maya: Agreed. Too depressing.

[Message 78] Liam: (Private message to Maya) Just trust me on this one.
[Message 79] Maya: (Private message to Liam) Okay… if you say so.
[Message 80] David: She said she wanted to get rid of him
[Message 81] Chloe: I'm kind of worried about Liam. He's been acting weird since it happened.
[Message 82] Maya: You think? I figured he was just stressed.
[Message 83] David: Stressed about what?
[Message 84] Chloe: I don't know! Maybe he knew Alex better than he's letting on.
[Message 85] Maya: You think he’s involved somehow? That's a pretty big accusation, Chloe.
[Message 86] Chloe: I'm just saying, his reaction seems off. Plus, he knew her more than he said.
[Message 87] David: He was looking up how to make Hitting with a golf club online.
[Message 88] Maya: Maybe we should just let the police handle it.
[Message 89] Chloe: You're right. But I'm still keeping an eye on him.
[Message 90] David: Me too.
[Message 91] Liam: Pizza’s here! You guys on your way?
[Message 92] Maya: Almost there!
[Message 93] David: On my way.
[Message 94] Chloe: I really hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 95] Maya: Me too. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 96] David: They deserve it.
[Message 97] Liam: What's everyone talking about?
[Message 98] Maya: Just about how terrible the whole situation is.
[Message 99] David: Yeah, nothing important.
[Message 100] Chloe: Did the police say anything about suspects?
[Message 101] Maya: Not that I heard.
[Message 102] Liam: They’ll figure it out. They always do.
[Message 103] David: Hope so.
[Message 104] Chloe: Me too.

[Message 106] Maya: Sure! I'll take a soda.

[Message 108] Chloe: Just water for me, thanks.
[Message 109] Maya: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened
[Message 110] David: Yeah, that's what I was thinking too.

[Message 11] CHLOE: Ugh, that's terrible, Jenna.
[Message 12] SAM: I need to finish this report for work. Talk later?
[Message 13] JENNA: Yeah, me too. So much to do.
[Message 14] CHLOE: Okay, later.
[Message 15] DEREK: Hey guys, anyone know if The Grind is open late tonight? Need coffee.
[Message 16] LORI: I think they close at 10. Why so late at work?
[Message 17] DEREK: Big project. Deadline looming.
[Message 18] LORI: Good luck! Hope you get some sleep.
[Message 19] DEREK: Thanks, I'll need it.
[Message 20] CHLOE: Anyone seen my blue sweater? I can't find it anywhere.
[Message 21] JENNA: Check your closet?
[Message 22] CHLOE: Already did.
[Message 23] SAM: Maybe you left it at the gym?
[Message 24] CHLOE: Good idea, I'll check tomorrow.
[Message 25] LORI: Hey, did you guys hear about that awful thing at the Playground?
[Message 26] DEREK: Yeah, I saw it on the news. Horrible.
[Message 27] LORI: Apparently, Vee was causing problems for everyone. It was only a matter of time, really.
[Message 28] DEREK: That's messed up, LORI. The manager didn't deserve it.
[Message 29] LORI: I didn't say they did! Just saying things were tense.
[Message 30] DEREK: Still...
[Message 31] JENNA: Guys, can we not talk about this right now? It's upsetting.
[Message 32] CHLOE: Yeah, please.
[Message 33] DEREK: Sorry.
[Message 34] LORI: Me too.
[Message 35] SAM: Movie night at my place Friday? Anyone in?
[Message 36] CHLOE: I'm in!
[Message 37] JENNA: Maybe. Depends on work.
[Message 38] DEREK: Sounds good.
[Message 39] LORI: I can bring snacks!
[Message 40] SAM: Perfect!
[Message 41] DEREK: Anyone know anything about the investigation?
[Message 42] LORI: Heard they're looking at everyone who was around there that day.
[Message 43] DEREK: Makes sense.
[Message 44] JENNA: Hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 45] CHLOE: Me too.
[Message 46] SAM: Seriously.
[Message 47] LORI: I saw Tanya near Playground that day.
[Message 48] DEREK: Tanya? Why would she be there?
[Message 49] LORI: I don't know. Just saw her.
[Message 50] JENNA: Tanya is weird.
[Message 51] CHLOE: Yeah, she's always been kinda off.
[Message 52] SAM: Let's not start rumors.
[Message 53] DEREK: Agreed.
[Message 54] LORI: Just saying what I saw! Don't shoot the messenger.
[Message 55] JENNA: Hey, anyone know a good mechanic? My car's making a weird noise.
[Message 56] CHLOE: I know one. I'll text you his number.
[Message 57] JENNA: Thanks!
[Message 58] SAM: I think Chris knows a good one too. He knows everything about cars.
[Message 59] CHLOE: Oh yeah! Chris is the man.
[Message 60] DEREK: Maybe Alex got caught in the crossfire.
[Message 61] LORI: Don't say that!
[Message 62] DEREK: Just a thought. They must go to away for a long time.
[Message 63] JENNA: Stop speculating, Derek.
[Message 64] CHLOE: Seriously, dude. Not cool.
[Message 65] SAM: Lay off, Derek.
[Message 66] DEREK: Sorry, sorry. Just trying to make sense of it.
[Message 67] LORI: It's senseless.
[Message 68] JENNA: Exactly.
[Message 69] CHLOE: What's everyone doing for dinner tonight?
[Message 70] SAM: Pizza?
[Message 71] JENNA: Sounds good.
[Message 72] DEREK: I'm in.
[Message 73] LORI: Me too!
[Message 74] CHLOE: Awesome!
[Message 75] DEREK: Anyone know when the funeral is?
[Message 76] LORI: I think it's next week. I'll check.
[Message 77] JENNA: It will be at st. Francis church.
[Message 78] CHLOE: Okay.
[Message 79] SAM: I want to pay my respects.
[Message 80] DEREK: Me too.
[Message 81] LORI: I intended to go.
[Message 82] JENNA: We should all go together.
[Message 83] CHLOE: Good idea.
[Message 84] SAM: Definitely.
[Message 85] DEREK: Okay.
[Message 86] LORI: Tanya always hated 3.  Taxi Driver, didn't she?
[Message 87] DEREK: Where is this coming from?
[Message 88] LORI: Just something I remember her saying once. It's really not that deep.
[Message 89] JENNA: This is getting weird again.
[Message 90] CHLOE: Seriously, LORI.
[Message 91] SAM: Stop it.
[Message 92] DEREK: Enough.
[Message 93] LORI: Fine, fine. Sorry.
[Message 94] JENNA: What movie are we watching Friday?
[Message 95] CHLOE: Let's watch that new horror one!
[Message 96] SAM: I'm down!
[Message 97] DEREK: Sure.
[Message 98] LORI: I hate horror movies!
[Message 99] JENNA: We can pick something else then.
[Message 100] CHLOE: Okay, what do you want to watch, LORI?
[Message 101] SAM: Something not too scary.
[Message 102] DEREK: Comedy?
[Message 103] LORI: Yeah, a comedy would be great.
[Message 104] JENNA: Let's decide later.
[Message 105] CHLOE: Sounds good.
[Message 106] SAM: Agreed.
[Message 107] DEREK: Okay.
[Message 108] LORI: Hey Derek, did you get that thing I asked you for?
[Message 109] DEREK: Not yet. I'll get it tomorrow.
[Message 110] LORI: Okay, thanks!
[Message 111] JENNA: Anyone else feeling super tired today?
[Message 112] CHLOE: Me! I could sleep for a week.
[Message 113] SAM: Same.
[Message 114] DEREK: Yeah, I'm dragging.
[Message 115] LORI: Must be the weather.
[Message 116] JENNA: Maybe.
[Message 117] CHLOE: Coffee time!
[Message 118] SAM: Yes!
[Message 119] DEREK: I'm on my third cup already.
[Message 120] LORI: Wow!
[Message 121] CHLOE: My mom always told me to call 911 when you see car accident.
[Message 122] SAM: Anyone talked to Chris lately?
[Message 123] JENNA: Not recently. Why?
[Message 124] CHLOE: Just wondering.
[Message 125] SAM: He's been acting weird.
[Message 126] DEREK: How so?
[Message 127] LORI: I heard he was looking up how to make Car accident (vehicular homicide) online
[Message 128] JENNA: What?! Seriously?
[Message 129] CHLOE: That's messed up!
[Message 130] SAM: I don't believe it.
[Message 131] DEREK: That can't be true.
[Message 132] LORI: I'm just saying what I heard!
[Message 133] JENNA: Where did you hear that?
[Message 134] CHLOE: Yeah, LORI, spill!
[Message 135] SAM: Come on, LORI.
[Message 136] DEREK: This is serious.
[Message 137] LORI: Okay, okay. It was just a rumor. I don't know if it's true.
[Message 138] JENNA: A rumor from where?
[Message 139] CHLOE: Yeah, give us a source!
[Message 140] SAM: LORI!
[Message 141] DEREK: We need to know.
[Message 142] LORI: Fine! It was...Tanya. She told me Chris was acting strange and looking up weird stuff.
[Message 143] JENNA: So Tanya is spreading rumors about Chris?
[Message 144] CHLOE: Great. Just what we needed. More drama.
[Message 145] SAM: Tanya is so unreliable.
[Message 146] DEREK: Agreed.
[Message 147] LORI: I didn't know if it was true or not! I was just...sharing.
[Message 148] JENNA: Sharing unfounded accusations.
[Message 149] CHLOE: Thanks a lot, LORI.
[Message 150] SAM: Ugh.
[Message 151] DEREK: I'm going to call Chris.
[Message 152] LORI: What? No! Don't!
[Message 153] JENNA: Why not?
[Message 154] CHLOE: Yeah, LORI, why not? Something you're not telling us?
[Message 155] SAM: Spill it!
[Message 156] DEREK: What's going on, LORI?
[Message 157] LORI: Look, I just... I saw Chris near the Playground that day too.
[Message 158] JENNA: Oh my god.
[Message 159] CHLOE: Seriously?
[Message 160] SAM: LORI...
[Message 161] DEREK: You knew this and didn't say anything?!
[Message 162] LORI: I was scared! What if I was wrong?
[Message 163] JENNA: Scared of what?
[Message 164] CHLOE: LORI, you need to tell the police EVERYTHING.
[Message 165] SAM: NOW.
[Message 166] DEREK: This is beyond messed up.
[Message 167] LORI: But... Tanya told me not to say anything! She said it could make things worse for everyone.
[Message 168] JENNA: What?! Tanya told you not to report a potential suspect in a double homicide?!
[Message 169] CHLOE: Tanya is involved in this somehow.
[Message 170] SAM: This is insane.
[Message 171] DEREK: LORI, listen to me. You need to go to the police RIGHT NOW and tell them everything you know about Chris and Tanya. Understand?
[Message 172] LORI: But...
[Message 173] JENNA: No buts, LORI. This is serious.
[Message 174] CHLOE: Do it now!
[Message 175] SAM: Before it's too late.
[Message 176] DEREK: We'll go with you.
[Message 177] LORI: Okay... okay, I'll do it. I was aware and should have say something.
[Message 178] JENNA: Good. We'll meet you there.

116,"[Message 1] Eleanor: ""Good morning, David! Another trade show day starting at dawn. Ugh, I had the strangest dream last night.""
[Message 2] David: ""Morning, Eleanor. Dawn is way too early for trade shows! Oh? A strange dream? Do tell. I'm all ears (and trying to wake up).""
[Message 3] Eleanor: ""I was dancing with a giant croissant...in a hospital. Makes no sense!""
[Message 4] David: ""A giant croissant? See, now I'm hungry. And slightly confused. Was it a sad hospital?""
[Message 5] Eleanor: ""No, strangely cheerful! Lots of balloons and... well, dancing croissants.""
[Message 6] David: ""Maybe it's a sign you need more carbs and less early mornings. Speaking of, did you see the latest listings downtown?""
[Message 7] Eleanor: ""Distracting me with real estate, David? Clever. But yes, tell me about the listings. And then back to the dream analysis!""
[Message 8] David: ""Okay, okay. Three new condos, prime location, but pricey. Back to the croissant dream... Maybe it's about needing comfort?""
[Message 9] Eleanor: ""Comfort...maybe! Or maybe I'm just stressed about the volunteering next week at the charity event.""
[Message 10] David: ""Ah, right! The one for the children's hospital? That's a good cause. Are you excited?""
[Message 11] Eleanor: ""Excited and a little nervous. I haven't worked with kids in ages!""
[Message 12] David: ""You'll be great, Eleanor. Your optimism is infectious. Remember the time you convinced Mrs. Higgins to take up tap dancing at age 80?""
[Message 13] Eleanor: ""Haha! Good times. She was a natural. But back to the dream - maybe the hospital was related to the charity event?""
[Message 14] David: ""Possibly. Dreams are weird that way. Subconscious anxieties bubbling up.""
[Message 15] Eleanor: ""True. What did you dream about, Mr. Real Estate Man?""
[Message 16] David: ""Oh, just the usual. Property taxes, leaky roofs, and impossible clients. Nothing exciting.""
[Message 17] Eleanor: ""Sounds stressful! Maybe you need a dancing croissant dream.""
[Message 18] David: ""I think I'd prefer a dream where all my contracts are signed and delivered. Is that too much to ask?""
[Message 19] Eleanor: ""Perhaps. Now, about those condos... are they near a good bakery?""
[Message 20] David: ""Of course! Excellent bakeries nearby. Essential for a good life, wouldn't you say?""
[Message 21] Eleanor: ""Absolutely essential. What's life without a good pain au chocolat?""
[Message 22] David: ""Exactly! Although, I'm more of a sourdough guy myself.""
[Message 23] Eleanor: ""Sourdough is good too! Especially with a bit of...dream interpretation?""
[Message 24] David: ""Ha! Okay, okay, I'll bite. What's your sourdough dream interpretation?""
[Message 25] Eleanor: ""Hmm... Sourdough requires patience and nurturing. Maybe you need to be more patient with your neurotic clients?""
[Message 26] David: ""That's... surprisingly insightful, Eleanor. Maybe I do. Easier said than done, though.""
[Message 27] Eleanor: ""I know. But you're a good guy, David. You'll figure it out. Just breathe...and maybe bake a loaf of sourdough.""
[Message 28] David: ""Baking *does* calm me down. Maybe I'll try a new recipe tonight. Anything interesting happening at the volunteering event?""
[Message 29] Eleanor: ""I'm supposed to be helping with arts and crafts. Pray for me.""
[Message 30] David: ""Arts and crafts? You'll be a natural! You're so creative with your dancing.""
[Message 31] Eleanor: ""Dancing and glitter glue are two very different beasts, David.""
[Message 32] David: ""True. But you're adaptable. I have faith! What kind of crafts are we talking about?""
[Message 33] Eleanor: ""Making get-well cards and little animal puppets, I think.""
[Message 34] David: ""Puppets! See, that's right up your alley. Expressive, creative, fun!""
[Message 35] Eleanor: ""Okay, you've convinced me. Maybe I'll even enjoy it. But if I come back covered in glitter, you're buying me dinner.""
[Message 36] David: ""Deal! What kind of food are you thinking? To celebrate the glitter or to wash away the glitter?""
[Message 37] Eleanor: ""Both! We'll call it a 'Glitter and Gloom' dinner. How's that sound?""
[Message 38] David: ""Perfect! Although, hopefully it's more 'Glitter and Glee' than 'Glitter and Gloom'.""
[Message 39] Eleanor: ""One can only hope! Okay, back to this trade show. Any interesting leads so far?""
[Message 40] David: ""A few. Mostly people looking for bargains. It's still early, though.""
[Message 41] Eleanor: ""True. Coffee time, I think. My brain is still half in croissant-dreamland.""
[Message 42] David: ""Good idea. I'll join you. My brain is stuck in leaky-roof-land.""
[Message 43] Eleanor: ""Sounds awful. We need to escape to a happier place. Like a bakery.""
[Message 44] David: ""Leading the way! Let's grab some pastries to fuel our trade show efforts.""
[Message 45] Eleanor: ""And maybe brainstorm a slogan for my volunteering effort. 'Dancing into Dreams'?""
[Message 46] David: ""I like it! Catchy. How about 'Bringing Joy, One Step at a Time'?""
[Message 47] Eleanor: ""Ooh, I like that too! You're a natural at this slogan stuff.""
[Message 48] David: ""Comes with the territory. Gotta sell those houses somehow.""
[Message 49] Eleanor: ""True! Okay, slogan brainstorm over coffee and croissants. Let's go!""
[Message 50] David: ""Let's! This trade show booth isn't going to run itself. And neither are our dreams.""
[Message 51] Eleanor: ""Speaking of dreams, do you think croissants dream of being danced with?""
[Message 52] David: ""That's... a philosophical question for 7 AM. I'll get back to you on that.""
[Message 53] Eleanor: ""Fair enough. Coffee first, philosophy later.""
[Message 54] David: ""Exactly. Lead the way to caffeine and carbs!""
[Message 55] Eleanor: ""This way, my friend! To a brighter, less leaky-roof-filled future!""
[Message 56] David: ""And maybe a slightly less croissant-filled dreamscape.""
[Message 57] Eleanor: ""Hey, don't knock the croissant dreams until you've tried them!""
[Message 58] David: ""I'll stick to sourdough dreams for now. Less…dancey.""
[Message 59] Eleanor: ""Your loss! But more sourdough for you, I suppose.""
[Message 60] David: ""Indeed. All the more for me to overthink. One thing I was wondering...""
[Message 61] Eleanor: ""Yes?""
[Message 62] David: ""Do you think the giant croissant was leavened? It would need to be fairly sturdy to dance, no?""
[Message 63] Eleanor: ""David! You're overthinking my dream again!""
[Message 64] David: ""I can't help it! Details matter! Especially in real estate...and apparently, in pastry-based dreams.""
[Message 65] Eleanor: ""Okay, fine. Let's say it was perfectly leavened. Light, yet strong. Happy now?""
[Message 66] David: ""Much. Okay, coffee. I need to stop analyzing your subconscious and focus on selling condos.""
[Message 67] Eleanor: ""A wise decision. Although, maybe we can use my dream as a marketing strategy? 'Live the Croissant Dream! Buy a Condo Today!'""
[Message 68] David: ""I... I don't think that will work, Eleanor. But I appreciate the enthusiasm.""
[Message 69] Eleanor: ""Worth a shot! Okay, okay. Real estate it is. But after this trade show, we're going to that bakery I told you about.""
[Message 70] David: ""The one with the perfect pain au chocolat? Deal! I'll bring the sourdough.""
[Message 71] Eleanor: ""Perfect! A baked goods summit.""
[Message 72] David: ""Precisely. It's settled then.""
[Message 73] Eleanor: ""Settled! Now, where's that coffee?""
[Message 74] David: ""Right this way, my friend. Adventure awaits!""
[Message 75] Eleanor: ""Adventure and caffeine. A winning combination!""
[Message 76] David: ""Agreed! And maybe, just maybe, a little less stress about volunteering and leaky roofs.""
[Message 77] Eleanor: ""One can only hope! But even if there's stress, we'll have coffee and pastries to help us through.""
[Message 78] David: ""A very good point. The power of baked goods should never be underestimated.""
[Message 79] Eleanor: ""Never! They're practically therapy.""
[Message 80] David: ""Cheaper than therapy, anyway. And tastier.""
[Message 81] Eleanor: ""Definitely tastier. Okay, coffee! I'm practically vibrating with anticipation.""
[Message 82] David: ""Same here! Lead on, dancing dream interpreter!""
[Message 83] Eleanor: ""To coffee and real estate success!""
[Message 84] David: ""To coffee, real estate, and conquering our respective anxieties!""
[Message 85] Eleanor: ""Hear, hear! And maybe a little bit of dancing along the way.""
[Message 86] David: ""If you promise not to make me dance with a giant sourdough loaf, I'm in.""
[Message 87] Eleanor: ""No promises! But I'll try to keep the dancing pastry-free.""
[Message 88] David: ""That's all I ask. Now, let's get this coffee!""
[Message 89] Eleanor: ""Let's go! My feet are practically itching to move.""
[Message 90] David: ""Just try to contain your dancing urges until after we've secured our caffeine fix.""
[Message 91] Eleanor: ""Deal! Coffee first, dancing later. Priorities, David, priorities!""
[Message 92] David: ""Indeed. Can't sell houses on an empty stomach, or without caffeine.""
[Message 93] Eleanor: ""Or without a positive attitude! Which I have plenty of... mostly.""
[Message 94] David: ""That's the spirit! And if the positive attitude falters, there's always coffee...and pastries.""
[Message 95] Eleanor: ""Exactly! Our secret weapon.""
[Message 96] David: ""Our sweet, doughy, caffeinated secret weapon.""
[Message 97] Eleanor: ""Perfectly put! Now, let's unleash it on this trade show.""
[Message 98] David: ""Agreed! Let the selling (and coffee drinking) begin!""
[Message 99] Eleanor: ""Onward! To caffeine-fueled victory!""
[Message 100] David: ""And perhaps, just perhaps, a slightly less stressful day than yesterday. Coffee awaits!""",0,

118,"[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey guys, heard about what happened on the bike path last night? So awful!

[Message 2] MARK: Yeah, crazy. Poor old Mr. Abernathy. And what about Jordan? Just terrible.

[Message 3] SAM: Seriously chilling. Was just there yesterday afternoon.

[Message 4] CHLOE: Me too! I saw Jamie heading that way around Dead of Night, hope they're okay.

[Message 5] JAMIE: Chloe, I'm fine. I was just taking a walk to clear my head. I didn't see anything.

[Message 6] MARK: Just a walk at that hour, Jamie? Weird.

[Message 7] JAMIE: Is it a crime to walk? I was feeling anxious and needed some air. Leave me alone, Mark.

[Message 8] SAM: Easy, guys. No need to jump down each other's throats. Chloe, why the concern about Jamie?

[Message 9] CHLOE: No reason, just… they looked upset lately. And you know, it's Greensboro, you never know.

[Message 10] MARK: Abernathy was such a grumpy old guy, always complaining at the bar. Said he “intended” to get revenge on someone, but never knew who.

[Message 11] SAM: He was a bartender, Mark, probably just venting about customers. Jordan was a Social Worker and kept to themself.

[Message 12] JAMIE: Okay, that’s enough. I’m going offline. This is making my anxiety worse.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Sorry, Jamie. Didn't mean to stress you out. Mark, maybe lay off a bit?

[Message 14] MARK: Fine, fine. Just saying, it’s all a bit sus. I saw Alex near the bike path around 11 pm. Remember when Alex said they wanted to ""get rid of"" Jordan?

[Message 15] SAM: Alex? Seriously? They wouldn't.

[Message 16] ALEX: Wow, Mark, throwing accusations already? I was nowhere near there. I was home all night. Besides, why would I, I was always nice to Jordan.

[Message 17] CHLOE: Guys, stop it. Let’s not speculate until we know more. The police will figure it out.

[Message 18] SAM: Chloe's right. Let's just try to support each other. This is awful for everyone.

[Message 19] MARK: Guess you're right. I still think Alex knew something was up that night on the bike path. She mentioned something about Pushing from a height.

[Message 20] ALEX: Seriously, Mark? You are twisting things! I said something COMPLETELY different. It was a joke about a movie!

[Message 21] JAMIE: Guys, the bike path isn't safe at night. I tried to call Jordan earlier that night to warn them, but they didn't pick up. I should have kept trying.

[Message 22] CHLOE: Jamie, don't blame yourself. You couldn't have known this would happen. The guilt won't help you.

[Message 23] SAM: Agreed. It's not your fault, Jamie. You're a good person. Plus, Jamie ""knew"" the victims, but Alex probably did it because of a personal vendetta.

[Message 24] MARK: Maybe Abernathy saw something and Jordan was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 25] ALEX: You're all making this worse. I'm done talking about this. This is a witch hunt!",1,

[Message 11] Alex: The wedding was nice! Good food, good music. You know, the usual.
[Message 12] Jamie: Glad you had a good time. Did they have a photo booth?
[Message 13] Alex: They did! I took a silly picture with the bride and groom.
[Message 14] River: Photo booths are always a good time. Anyway, back to cars. Anyone seen the new Hyundai Ioniq 5 in person?
[Message 15] Jamie: I haven't, but I've seen pictures. Looks pretty futuristic.
[Message 16] Alex: I've seen one driving around downtown. It's definitely eye-catching.
[Message 17] River: I'm thinking about getting an electric vehicle in the next few years.
[Message 18] Jamie: They're definitely becoming more popular. Less maintenance, right?
[Message 19] Alex: Supposedly. I'm still a bit skeptical about the battery life in the winter.
[Message 20] River: Yeah, that's a valid concern. Especially here in Washington.
[Message 21] Jamie: Maybe hybrid is the way to go for now? Best of both worlds.
[Message 22] Alex: That's what I'm thinking. I've been looking at the Toyota Prius Prime.
[Message 23] River: The Prius Prime is a solid choice. Good fuel economy.
[Message 24] Jamie: Plus, you can plug it in and get some electric range.
[Message 25] Alex: Exactly. Okay, enough about cars. I'm starving. Anyone want to order some pizza?
[Message 26] Jamie: Pizza sounds amazing! I'm in.
[Message 27] River: I'm always in for pizza. What kind are we thinking?
[Message 28] Alex: How about pepperoni and a veggie one?
[Message 29] Jamie: Perfect! Pepperoni for me.
[Message 30] River: Veggie for me, please.
[Message 31] Alex: Alright, ordering now. Should be here in about 30 minutes.
[Message 32] Jamie: Awesome. So, River, what are you reading these days?
[Message 33] River: I'm currently reading ""Project Hail Mary"" by Andy Weir. It's really good sci-fi.
[Message 34] Alex: Andy Weir? Is that the guy who wrote ""The Martian""?
[Message 35] River: Yep, that's him! This one is just as good, if not better.
[Message 36] Jamie: I might have to check that out. I need a new book to read.
[Message 37] Alex: Me too. I haven't read anything in ages. I've been too busy with teaching and sports.
[Message 38] Jamie: Speaking of sports, Alex, are you still playing tennis?
[Message 39] Alex: I am! Trying to play at least twice a week. Keeps me young, or so I tell myself.
[Message 40] River: You're 95, you're doing amazing just walking!
[Message 41] Alex: Hey! (string concatenation) I'm only"" + str(int('9') + int('5')) + "". And I can still beat you at tennis, River.
[Message 42] River: Haha, I doubt that. I'm pretty good.
[Message 43] Jamie: We should all go sometime. I'm terrible, but it's fun.
[Message 44] Alex: Sounds like a plan! We'll set something up next week.
[Message 45] River: Cool. I'm in.
[Message 46] Jamie: Great! Pizza should be here soon.
[Message 47] Alex: I think I hear the delivery guy!
[Message 48] Jamie: Score!
[Message 49] River: Finally! I'm starving.
[Message 50] Alex: Okay, pizza is here! Let's eat!
[Message 51] Jamie: Yay!
[Message 52] River: Best news I've heard all night.
[Message 53] Alex: Alright, let's dig in.
[Message 54] Jamie: So, what are your plans for tomorrow, Alex?
[Message 55] Alex: Grading papers, unfortunately. The never-ending task of a teacher.
[Message 56] River: Ugh, I feel your pain. Reading through essays can be brutal.
[Message 57] Jamie: I'm showing houses all day. Hopefully, I can close a deal!
[Message 58] Alex: Good luck with that, Jamie!
[Message 59] River: Yeah, hope you sell a mansion!
[Message 60] Jamie: Thanks! I appreciate it. I really need a win this week.
[Message 61] Alex: You got this! Just remember to highlight the best features of the house.
[Message 62] River: And bake some cookies before the showing. Smells sell houses!
[Message 63] Jamie: That's a great idea, River! I'll definitely keep that in mind.
[Message 64] Alex: Okay, back to pizza. This is really good.
[Message 65] Jamie: Agreed! This pepperoni is on point.
[Message 66] River: The veggie one is surprisingly flavorful.
[Message 67] Alex: I'm glad we got both. Something for everyone.
[Message 68] Jamie: Totally. Okay, I'm officially stuffed.
[Message 69] River: Me too. Pizza coma incoming.
[Message 70] Alex: Same here. Think I'm going to pass out soon.
[Message 71] Jamie: Well, it's almost midnight. Time to wind down.
[Message 72] River: Agreed. I'm going to go read a bit before bed.
[Message 73] Alex: I might watch some mindless TV.
[Message 74] Jamie: Sounds relaxing. Good night, guys!
[Message 75] River: Good night, Jamie! Good night, Alex!
[Message 76] Alex: Good night, you two!
[Message 77] Jamie: Sleep well!
[Message 78] River: You too!
[Message 79] Alex: So, River, how long have you been a truck driver?
[Message 80] River: About 5 years now. It has its ups and downs, but I enjoy the freedom.
[Message 81] Jamie: Wow, 5 years is a long time! Do you travel all over the country?
[Message 82] River: Mostly the West Coast. Sometimes I go as far as Texas.
[Message 83] Alex: That's a lot of driving!
[Message 84] River: Tell me about it! But I get to see some amazing scenery.
[Message 85] Jamie: I bet! What's the most beautiful place you've driven through?
[Message 86] River: Probably the Pacific Coast Highway in California. Absolutely stunning.
[Message 87] Alex: I've always wanted to drive that.
[Message 88] Jamie: Me too! Road trip goals.
[Message 89] River: You should definitely do it sometime. It's worth the hype.
[Message 90] Alex: Maybe this summer. I'll be off from teaching.
[Message 91] Jamie: Count me in! If I'm not too busy with work.
[Message 92] River: We'll make it happen. Okay, seriously going to bed now.
[Message 93] Alex: Alright, night night!
[Message 94] Jamie: Sweet dreams!
[Message 95] River: You too!
[Message 96] Alex: Hey, random question, Jamie, do you prefer cats or dogs?
[Message 97] Jamie: Ooh, that's a tough one! I love both, but I think I'm leaning towards cats. They're so independent.
[Message 98] Alex: I'm a dog person myself. Loyal companions.
[Message 99] River: I'm allergic to both, so I admire them from afar.
[Message 100] Jamie: Aww, that's a bummer, River.
[Message 101] Alex: Yeah, that's tough. Well, good night for real this time!
[Message 102] Jamie: Good night!
[Message 103] River: Night!
[Message 104] Alex: Sleep tight!
[Message 105] Jamie: Don't let the bed bugs bite!
[Message 106] River: Haha!
[Message 107] Alex: (laughs) Okay, I'm out.
[Message 108] Jamie: Me too. Peace out!
[Message 109] River: Good night, everyone!

[Message 4] Liam: Restaurant? No, what happened?
[Message 5] Chloe: Crazy stuff. Apparently two people were found dead there this morning.
[Message 6] Liam: Seriously? That's awful! Who were they?
[Message 7] Chloe: No names released yet. One was a journalist, the other a kid.
[Message 8] Liam: Journalist? Wow. Sounds like a story.
[Message 9] Chloe: Right? The news is saying strangulation.

[Message 35] Maya: Heard about the Restaurant murders?
[Message 36] Sarah: Yeah, terrible.
[Message 37] Maya: Did you know either of them?
[Message 38] Sarah: No, why would I?
[Message 39] Maya: Just asking. The journalist, her name was Olivia, apparently she was digging into some shady stuff.
[Message 40] Sarah: That's what they all say.

[Message 52] Maya: Liam? What was he doing there?
[Message 53] Sarah: I don't know! Just saw him walking in. He looked really nervous.
[Message 54] Maya: Weird. Maybe he knows something about the Restaurant thing?
[Message 55] Sarah: I don't know what he could know.
[Message 56] Maya: Could just be a coincidence. Still, something's off.
[Message 57] Sarah: I'm starting to think so too.
[Message 58] Maya: Call me later? We should talk about this.
[Message 59] Sarah: Yeah, definitely.
[Message 60] Chloe: Liam, Sarah said she saw you at the police station?
[Message 61] Liam: What? That's ridiculous. I was at home all day.
[Message 62] Chloe: She said you looked nervous.
[Message 63] Liam: She's lying. I was literally here watching TV with you.
[Message 64] Chloe: Okay, okay. Just asking.
[Message 65] Maya: Did you ask him?
[Message 66] Sarah: Yeah, he denied it. Said he was with Chloe all day.
[Message 67] Maya: Liar.
[Message 68] Sarah: I know. He's definitely hiding something. The 16-year-old girl was dealing drugs. I knew it, just didn't want to say anything.
[Message 69] Maya: Maybe he was buying from her? That journalist, Olivia, was on his case. I think.
[Message 70] Sarah: Maybe. Or maybe he was there for something else entirely. Remember that thing he said about always hating Olivia?
[Message 71] Maya: Yeah.
[Message 72] Chloe: Liam, you never told me you hated Olivia.
[Message 73] Liam: I don't hate her! I just… didn't agree with her reporting.
[Message 74] Chloe: That's different.
[Message 75] Maya: Did you guys know Olivia?
[Message 76] Sarah: I knew of her. She wrote an article about my workplace once.
[Message 77] Maya: Liam?
[Message 78] Liam: Met her a few times. She was always asking questions.
[Message 79] Chloe: See?
[Message 80] Maya: Okay, this is getting weird. I'm gonna do some digging.
[Message 81] Sarah: Be careful, Maya.
[Message 82] Chloe: Yeah, don't get involved.
[Message 83] Maya: I just want to know the truth. If Liam is involved, he should face the consequences.
[Message 84] Liam: Maya, just leave it alone. You're going to get yourself in trouble.
[Message 85] Chloe: Yeah, Liam's right.
[Message 86] Sarah: He should have called 911 right away. He failed to do so when he knew about the drug issues. The punishment should be severe.
[Message 87] Maya: No one is going to get in trouble if they tell the truth.
[Message 88] Chloe: Sometimes the truth is dangerous.
[Message 89] Liam: Exactly.
[Message 90] Sarah: I think so too. Sometimes its better if the truth is buried.
[Message 91] Maya: I understand the risk now.
[Message 92] Chloe: Be safe, Maya.
[Message 93] Liam: I am too. Please be very careful.
[Message 94] Sarah: Me as well.
[Message 95] Maya: You're right.
[Message 96] Sarah: So what now? Are we done?
[Message 97] Maya: Do you think Liam had something to do with asphyxiation by strangulation?
[Message 98] Chloe: We shouldn't jump to any conclusion until there's more evidence.
[Message 99] Sarah: I think he's protecting someone.
[Message 100] Maya: Who? Chloe?
[Message 101] Chloe: Me? Why would I need protecting?
[Message 102] Liam: She's the last person to need protection. I would never hurt someone.
[Message 103] Chloe: That's right.
[Message 104] Sarah: It's not always about needing it, Chloe. Sometimes it's about wanting it.
[Message 105] Maya: Well, someone wanted Olivia and the 16-year-old drug dealer gone.
[Message 106] Chloe: Let's just wait for the police to figure it out.
[Message 107] Liam: Yeah, let the professionals handle it.
[Message 108] Sarah: It was her shouting at the victim. It probably provoked the assailant.
[Message 109] Maya: But what if they get it wrong?
[Message 110] Chloe: They won't.
[Message 111] Liam: Hopefully.
[Message 112] Sarah: I don't know. What if their attempt fails?

[Message 2] Jamie: ""Thinking about hitting up the farmers market Saturday morning. Always a good start to the weekend.""
[Message 3] Riley: ""Ooh, the farmers market! I might join you, Jamie. Need to restock my veggies.""
[Message 4] Alex: ""Farmers market sounds lovely, but I was hoping for something a bit more...exciting?""
[Message 5] Sam: ""There's that classic car show downtown on Sunday, Alex. That might be up your alley.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Sam, you read my mind! Car show it is. Anyone else interested?""
[Message 7] Riley: ""Not really my thing, but have fun!""
[Message 8] Jamie: ""I'll pass on the car show. I'm more of a 'relaxing Sunday' kind of person.""
[Message 9] Sam: ""Completely understand. I might swing by for an hour or two. Get my dose of automotive eye candy.""
[Message 10] Alex: ""Perfect! Maybe we can grab coffee there, Sam?""
[Message 11] Sam: ""Sounds good, Alex. I'll let you know Sunday morning.""
[Message 12] Jamie: ""Anyone volunteering at the food bank this weekend? They usually need help on Saturdays.""
[Message 13] Riley: ""I've been meaning to do that! What time are they open?""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""They usually start around 9 AM and go until noon.""
[Message 15] Riley: ""Okay, I might actually join you for that, Jamie. Good way to spend a Saturday morning.""
[Message 16] Alex: ""That's a great idea, you two. I've been meaning to give back more.""
[Message 17] Sam: ""Yeah, volunteering is always a good option. I've done some work at the animal shelter before.""
[Message 18] Alex: ""Oh, animal shelters are amazing! I love dogs, but my apartment complex doesn't allow them.""
[Message 19] Riley: ""That's a bummer, Alex. Maybe you can just visit them at the shelter?""
[Message 20] Alex: ""True! Okay, maybe food bank Saturday morning, car show Sunday afternoon?""
[Message 21] Jamie: ""Sounds like a plan, Alex! See you at the food bank, Riley.""
[Message 22] Riley: ""Yep! See you then, Jamie.""
[Message 23] Sam: ""Enjoy the farmers market, Jamie! And the car show, Alex!""
[Message 24] Jamie: ""Will do! Maybe I'll find some amazing tomatoes.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""I'm hoping to see some vintage Mustangs!""
[Message 26] Riley: ""Speaking of food, has anyone tried that new Thai place on Elm Street?""
[Message 27] Jamie: ""No, but I've heard good things! Is it any good?""
[Message 28] Riley: ""It's delicious! A little pricey, but worth it for a treat.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Thai food sounds amazing right now! Maybe we can all go sometime next week?""
[Message 30] Sam: ""I'm in! Let's pencil it in for Tuesday?""
[Message 31] Jamie: ""Tuesday works for me! I'll check my schedule.""
[Message 32] Riley: ""Perfect! Tuesday it is, unless something comes up.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Great! Okay, so food bank, car show, and Thai food. Busy week ahead!""
[Message 34] Sam: ""Sounds like a blast, Alex. I'm looking forward to it.""
[Message 35] Jamie: ""Me too! Good to have some plans.""
[Message 36] Riley: ""Agreed! Keeps me from just sitting on the couch all weekend.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Exactly! I need to be productive, even if it's just 'fun' productive.""
[Message 38] Sam: ""I get that. I find myself getting restless if I don't have anything going on.""
[Message 39] Jamie: ""I actually prefer quiet weekends sometimes. Recharge my batteries.""
[Message 40] Riley: ""Totally understandable, Jamie. We all need our downtime.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Well, this weekend seems to be a good mix of both activity and relaxation!""
[Message 42] Sam: ""Agreed. Perfect balance.""
[Message 43] Jamie: ""Has anyone seen that new documentary on Netflix about...gardening?""
[Message 44] Riley: ""Gardening? No, but I've been watching 'The Great British Baking Show' again.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Oh, I love that show, Riley! So relaxing.""
[Message 46] Sam: ""I'm more of a sports guy myself. Catching up on some old games.""
[Message 47] Jamie: ""See, that's why I like documentaries. Learn something new while relaxing.""
[Message 48] Riley: ""True! I learn a lot from baking shows too, though. Like how NOT to make a soggy bottom.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Haha! Good point, Riley. Soggy bottoms are never good.""
[Message 50] Sam: ""Unless you're talking about boots in the rain, maybe?""
[Message 51] Jamie: ""Even then, not ideal!""
[Message 52] Riley: ""Agreed! Dry feet are essential for a good weekend.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Okay, back to weekend plans! Anything else we should add to the itinerary?""
[Message 54] Sam: ""Maybe a nap?""
[Message 55] Jamie: ""Always a good idea, Sam.""
[Message 56] Riley: ""I'm a big fan of naps.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Alright, naps are officially on the list. Everyone gets a mandatory nap.""
[Message 58] Sam: ""Awesome. I'm already feeling more relaxed.""
[Message 59] Jamie: ""Me too! Just the thought of a nap is soothing.""
[Message 60] Riley: ""I might need a nap after volunteering at the food bank. All that lifting!""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Good point! I'll pace myself.""
[Message 62] Sam: ""Don't want anyone throwing out their back.""
[Message 63] Jamie: ""Definitely. Safety first!""
[Message 64] Riley: ""Okay, well, I should probably get back to work. This weekend chat has been lovely though!""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Me too! Thanks for the suggestions, everyone.""
[Message 66] Sam: ""No problem! Have a great weekend, everyone!""
[Message 67] Jamie: ""You too! See you Saturday, Riley.""
[Message 68] Riley: ""See ya, Jamie!""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Later, everyone!""
[Message 70] Sam: ""Later!""
[Message 71] Jamie: ""Okay, off to research the best tomato varieties...for the farmers market, of course.""
[Message 72] Riley: ""Haha! Good luck with that, Jamie!""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Maybe you'll find some heirloom tomatoes!""
[Message 74] Sam: ""Those are the best!""
[Message 75] Jamie: ""Hoping so! I'm planning a caprese salad.""
[Message 76] Riley: ""Sounds delicious!""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Now I'm hungry!""
[Message 78] Sam: ""Me too! Maybe I should grab a snack.""
[Message 79] Jamie: ""Do it! Fuel up for the rest of the day.""
[Message 80] Riley: ""Good advice! I'm going to go find some almonds.""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Okay, I'm going to try to resist the urge to order takeout.""
[Message 82] Sam: ""You can do it, Alex! Think of the caprese salad!""
[Message 83] Jamie: ""Exactly! And the Thai food next week!""
[Message 84] Riley: ""Lots of good food in our future!""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Alright, you've convinced me. No takeout tonight.""
[Message 86] Sam: ""Victory!""
[Message 87] Jamie: ""Good job, Alex!""

[Message 102] Jamie: ""Waze is also a good option!""
[Message 103] Riley: ""Or, you know, just follow the loud engine noises.""
[Message 104] Alex: ""Haha! Good point, Riley. That might actually work.""
[Message 105] Sam: ""True! Can't miss those classic cars.""

[Message 2] Chris: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. Who were they?
[Message 3] Maya: Some Journalist named Alex and a taxi driver, I think his name was Ben?
[Message 4] Chris: Ben? Wow, that's awful.
[Message 5] Maya: I know, right? Saginaw is getting scary.
[Message 6] Chris: Seriously. Lock your doors. What time did it happen?
[Message 7] Maya: Late Morning, I heard.
[Message 8] Chris: I was grabbing coffee then. At least I have an alibi.
[Message 9] Maya: Haha, yeah, me too. Netflix and chill.
[Message 10] Chris: Lucky you. I had to deal with Mrs. Gable all morning.
[Message 11] Maya: Ugh, she's the worst.
[Message 12] Chris: Tell me about it. Anyway, anything else about the Library thing?
[Message 13] Maya: Not really. Police are all over the place.
[Message 14] Chris: Good. Hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 15] Maya: Me too.
[Message 16] Chris: Hey, did you see Leo yesterday?
[Message 17] Maya: Leo? Nope. Why?
[Message 18] Chris: Just wondering. He seemed a bit off last week.
[Message 19] Maya: Off how?
[Message 20] Chris: Just… quiet. More than usual.
[Message 21] Maya: Leo's always quiet. Don't worry about it.
[Message 22] Chris: I guess you're right.
[Message 23] Maya: You okay? You seem stressed.
[Message 24] Chris: Just a lot on my mind. Work, you know?
[Message 25] Maya: Yeah, I get it.
[Message 26] Chris: Anyway, gotta run. Talk later?
[Message 27] Maya: Sure. Bye.
[Message 28] Chris: Later.

[Message 29] Sarah: This is insane. I can’t believe this happened.
[Message 30] David: I know. Alex was such a good writer. And Ben was always friendly.
[Message 31] Sarah: It’s just… random.
[Message 32] David: The police will figure it out.
[Message 33] Sarah: I hope so. Did you know either of them well?
[Message 34] David: Not really. I saw Alex around the coffee shop sometimes.
[Message 35] Sarah: Me neither with Alex.
[Message 36] David: I used to work with Ben. We carpooled to a different job a few years ago.
[Message 37] Sarah: Oh really?
[Message 38] David: Yeah, he was always talking about his family.
[Message 39] Sarah: Poor guy.
[Message 40] David: Did you see anything strange lately?
[Message 41] Sarah: No, why?
[Message 42] David: Just wondering if anyone seemed… angry or upset.
[Message 43] Sarah: Not really. Everyone’s stressed with work, but nothing out of the ordinary.
[Message 44] David: Maybe it was some random act of violence.
[Message 45] Sarah: Maybe. It's such a terrible thought.
[Message 46] David: I agree. I’m going to try and not think about it.
[Message 47] Sarah: Easier said than done.
[Message 48] David: You’re right. I’m going to volunteer at the shelter tomorrow. Try to do some good.
[Message 49] Sarah: That’s a great idea.
[Message 50] David: Need to focus on something positive.
[Message 51] Sarah: I might join you.
[Message 52] David: That would be great.
[Message 53] Sarah: Okay, let’s plan it.
[Message 54] David: Perfect.

[Message 57] Leo: ...
[Message 58] Jake: You okay? You've been quiet.
[Message 59] Leo: Yeah, just tired.
[Message 60] Jake: You seem more than tired. You were supposed to meet me Late Morning and you didnt show up.
[Message 61] Leo: Sorry. Something came up.
[Message 62] Jake: What?
[Message 63] Leo: Doesn’t matter. I couldn't make it.
[Message 64] Jake: Sounds like a big deal.
[Message 65] Leo: It wasn't.
[Message 66] Jake: The news about Alex and Ben is horrible, huh?
[Message 67] Leo: Yeah.
[Message 68] Jake: Do you know them?
[Message 69] Leo: No.
[Message 70] Jake: Everyone's talking about it. It happened at the Library.
[Message 71] Leo: I know.
[Message 72] Jake: You seem… detached.
[Message 73] Leo: I'm just tired, Jake.
[Message 74] Jake: You sure? You can tell me anything.
[Message 75] Leo: I know.
[Message 76] Jake: Seriously.
[Message 77] Leo: Thanks.
[Message 78] Jake: What were you doing Late Morning yesterday?
[Message 79] Leo: Just… stuff.
[Message 80] Jake: Like what ""stuff""? I am worried, talk to me.
[Message 81] Leo: I went for a walk.
[Message 82] Jake: Where?
[Message 83] Leo: Around.
[Message 84] Jake: Leo, this is getting weird.
[Message 85] Leo: I don't want to talk about it.
[Message 86] Jake: Okay. But if you need anything…
[Message 87] Leo: I know.
[Message 88] Jake: I mean it.
[Message 89] Leo: I know.
[Message 90] Jake: I'm here for you.
[Message 91] Leo: Thanks, Jake.
[Message 92] Jake: No problem.
[Message 93] Leo: Really.
[Message 94] Jake: Just… be careful, okay?
[Message 95] Leo: Always.
[Message 96] Jake: Promise?
[Message 97] Leo: Promise.
[Message 98] Jake: Good.

[Message 99] Chris: Hey Maya, you still up?
[Message 100] Maya: Yeah, just watching TV. What’s up?
[Message 101] Chris: Something weird. I saw Leo near the Library yesterday Late Morning.
[Message 102] Maya: Really? So?
[Message 103] Chris: He looked really agitated. And he was walking away fast.
[Message 104] Maya: Coincidence.
[Message 105] Chris: Maybe. But it’s bothering me. He was always complaining how unfair it was that Alex wrote a bad article about him. He intended to cause problems to Alex.
[Message 106] Maya: You think he had something to do with it?
[Message 107] Chris: I don’t know. It's probably nothing.
[Message 108] Maya: Don’t go spreading rumors.
[Message 109] Chris: I’m not! Just… be aware.
[Message 110] Maya: Aware of what?
[Message 111] Chris: Nothing. Forget I said anything.
[Message 112] Maya: Now you’ve got me worried.
[Message 113] Chris: Sorry. I shouldn’t have said anything.
[Message 114] Maya: Now I can't sleep.
[Message 115] Chris: Ugh, sorry. Look, just… if you see Leo, be careful.
[Message 116] Maya: You’re scaring me.
[Message 117] Chris: I didn’t mean to. I’m an idiot.
[Message 118] Maya: You are.
[Message 119] Chris: Look, I gotta go. I’m making things worse.
[Message 120] Maya: Fine. Bye.
[Message 121] Chris: Sorry again.

[Message 122] Jake: Did you hear about Alex and Ben?
[Message 123] David: Yeah, it's terrible.
[Message 124] Jake: I’m really worried about Leo.
[Message 125] David: Why?
[Message 126] Jake: He’s been acting strange. And he was supposed to meet me near the Library yesterday Late Morning, but he didn’t show.
[Message 127] David: That's odd.
[Message 128] Jake: I know. And he won’t tell me where he was.
[Message 129] David: Maybe he’s just embarrassed.
[Message 130] Jake: About what?
[Message 131] David: I don’t know. Maybe he failed a test or something.
[Message 132] Jake: He seems… guilty.
[Message 133] David: Guilty of what? You're not saying that he is aware and did something bad?
[Message 134] Jake: I don’t know! I’m just worried. He always hated Journalistic articles and the harm it may have caused.
[Message 135] David: I understand. But don’t jump to conclusions.
[Message 136] Jake: I can’t help it.
[Message 137] David: Have you called the police?
[Message 138] Jake: No! I don’t want to get him in trouble if he’s innocent.
[Message 139] David: Then talk to him.
[Message 140] Jake: I tried! He won’t talk to me.
[Message 141] David: Keep trying.
[Message 142] Jake: Okay.
[Message 143] David: But if you really think he’s involved, you have to tell someone. The punishment for this crime is really harsh.

[Message 72] Ben: ""About the lake? Not really.""
[Message 73] Liam: ""I do.""
[Message 74] Ben: ""Why?""
[Message 75] Liam: ""Just… something happened.""
[Message 76] Ben: ""A lot of things happened.""
[Message 77] Liam: ""This was different.""
[Message 78] Ben: ""How so?""
[Message 79] Liam: ""I can't explain.""
[Message 80] Ben: ""Okay. Well, I gotta go.""
[Message 81] Liam: ""Leaving too?""
[Message 82] Ben: ""Got a meeting. See ya.""
[Message 83] Liam: ""Right. Later.""
[Message 84] *Ben has left the chat*
[Message 85] Liam: ""Great.""
[Message 86] Liam: ""Anyone else even remember?""
[Message 87] Mark: ""Remember what?""
[Message 88] Liam: ""Oh, hey Mark. Didn't see you there.""
[Message 89] Mark: ""Just got here. What's up?""
[Message 90] Liam: ""Nothing. Just thinking about old times.""
[Message 91] Mark: ""Like...?""
[Message 92] Liam: ""Summer at the lake. Remember?""
[Message 93] Mark: ""Sure, vaguely. Good times.""
[Message 94] Liam: ""Were they?""
[Message 95] Mark: ""I thought so. Why?""
[Message 96] Liam: ""Just... certain things.""
[Message 97] Mark: ""Like what kind of things?""",2,
129,"[Message 1] Maya: ""Hey Liam, you going to the Farmer's Market tomorrow?""
[Message 2] Liam: ""Nah, got stuff to do around the house. Why?""
[Message 3] Maya: ""Just wondering. Heard they had good peaches last week.""
[Message 4] Chloe: ""Peaches are overrated. Strawberries are where it's at. Especially at Farmer's Market.""
[Message 5] Maya: ""Agree to disagree, Chloe. 😉""
[Message 6] Liam: ""Speaking of, anyone see the news about what happened there?""
[Message 7] Chloe: ""Yeah, awful. That poor person. I think their name was Bailey?""
[Message 8] Maya: ""Bailey, right. Tragic. Dawn, too. Who does something like that?""
[Message 9] Liam: ""No idea. Crazy world.""
[Message 10] Chloe: ""I was actually thinking of going to the market to pay my respects. Anyone wanna join? I'm free now""
[Message 11] Maya: ""Maybe later, Chloe. Got a ton of work to catch up on.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Same here. Deadlines, deadlines.""
[Message 13] Chloe: ""Suit yourselves. I'm heading over.""
[Message 14] Maya: ""Be careful out there!""
[Message 15] Liam: ""Yeah, stay safe, Chloe.""
[Message 16] Chloe: ""Always am. 😉""
[Message 17] Maya: ""Liam, did you happen to see Xavier around the market before?""
[Message 18] Liam: ""Xavier? Nope. Haven't seen him in ages. Why?""
[Message 19] Maya: ""Just curious. He mentioned wanting to go.""
[Message 20] Liam: ""Heard he was having some money problems again, though.""
[Message 21] Chloe: ""Oh, Xavier? I saw him walking around near the entrance, a few days ago. It was odd, he looked pretty angry.""
[Message 22] Maya: ""Hmm, interesting.""
[Message 23] Liam: ""Angry about what?""
[Message 24] Chloe: ""No clue. Just seemed generally upset. Maybe he got ripped off buying some organic kale?""
[Message 25] Maya: ""Haha, maybe. Hey, did either of you know Bailey well?""
[Message 26] Liam: ""Nah, just saw them around. Seemed nice enough.""
[Message 27] Chloe: ""Same. They were always friendly, though. Always had a smile for everyone. That's why it's so shocking.""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Yeah, it is.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Anyway, gotta get back to work. Talk later.""
[Message 30] Maya: ""Later, Liam.""
[Message 31] Chloe: ""Catch you on the flip side.""
[Message 32] Maya: ""Chloe, a little off-topic, but did you ever get that electrical problem in your apartment fixed?""
[Message 33] Chloe: ""Which one? The one in the kitchen? Yeah, eventually. It was a pain. Kept tripping the breaker.""
[Message 34] Maya: ""Okay, just checking. Weird question, I know.""
[Message 35] Chloe: ""No worries. Why?""
[Message 36] Maya: ""Just thinking out loud. The news mentioned Electrocution. Seemed oddly specific.""
[Message 37] Chloe: ""True. Creepy, though. Makes you think.""
[Message 38] Liam: ""Electrocution? Jesus. That's brutal.""
[Message 39] Maya: ""Yeah. Makes you wonder what kind of person does that.""
[Message 40] Chloe: ""A messed up one, that's for sure. I hope they catch them soon.""
[Message 41] Liam: ""Me too. Justice for Bailey.""
[Message 42] Maya: ""Amen to that.""
[Message 43] Chloe: ""So, anyone know if the market will be open this weekend?""
[Message 44] Liam: ""Probably not. Gotta be a crime scene, right?""
[Message 45] Maya: ""Yeah, I'd imagine it's closed for the foreseeable future.""
[Message 46] Chloe: ""Bummer. I needed some good tomatoes.""
[Message 47] Maya: ""First world problems, Chloe. 😉""
[Message 48] Chloe: ""Hey, good tomatoes are important! 🍅""
[Message 49] Liam: ""True that.""
[Message 50] Maya: ""Hey Chloe, remember that time Xavier said he wanted to get rid of the manager at his old job?""
[Message 51] Chloe: ""Yeah, vaguely. Why?""
[Message 52] Maya: ""Just remembered it. Seemed like he always hated 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""Xavier exaggerates everything. He probably just meant he was annoyed with him.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Yeah, Xavier's all talk.""
[Message 55] Maya: ""Maybe. Still, thought it was worth mentioning.""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Fair enough. Speaking of work, I'm drowning in it. Gotta run. Ttyl!""
[Message 57] Maya: ""Later, Chloe.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Bye.""
[Message 59] Maya: ""Liam, you still there?""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Yup. What's up?""
[Message 61] Maya: ""Something's not sitting right with me about this whole thing.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 63] Maya: ""Just a gut feeling. The Electrocution, Xavier being angry, Chloe's electrical problem...""
[Message 64] Liam: ""You think Chloe or Xavier did it?""
[Message 65] Maya: ""I don't know what to think. It is just strange the way she was asking about the electrical problem being fixed.""
[Message 66] Liam: ""Could be a coincidence. Don't jump to conclusions.""
[Message 67] Maya: ""Maybe. But I'm keeping my eyes open.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""Fair enough. I'll do the same.""
[Message 69] Maya: ""Thanks, Liam. Appreciate it.""
[Message 70] Liam: ""No problem. We gotta look out for each other.""
[Message 71] Maya: ""Exactly. Hey, gotta run. Talk soon.""
[Message 72] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Hey guys, I was at the market. Place is taped off, obviously. Really sad vibe.""
[Message 74] Maya: ""Yeah, I can imagine.""
[Message 75] Liam: ""Did you see anyone you knew?""
[Message 76] Chloe: ""Just a few people milling around, paying their respects. And...Xavier was there. Looking kinda shifty, if you ask me.""
[Message 77] Maya: ""Shifty how?""
[Message 78] Chloe: ""Just...avoiding eye contact, pacing. Kept looking over his shoulder.""
[Message 79] Liam: ""That does sound suspicious.""
[Message 80] Maya: ""Definitely adds to the picture.""
[Message 81] Chloe: ""Right? Like he knew something he wasn't saying.""
[Message 82] Liam: ""Maybe we should tell the police what we know.""
[Message 83] Maya: ""I agree. Every little bit helps.""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""I'm happy to talk to them. I mean, I was there to pay my respects.""
[Message 85] Liam: ""Me too. Let's coordinate tomorrow?""
[Message 86] Maya: ""Sounds like a plan. Good night, guys.""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""Night!""
[Message 88] Liam: ""Night, Maya.""
[Message 89] Chloe: ""Hey Maya, I had a weird dream last night.""
[Message 90] Maya: ""Oh? About what?""
[Message 91] Chloe: ""About the market. And...well, it's silly.""
[Message 92] Maya: ""Tell me anyway.""
[Message 93] Chloe: ""Okay, but don't laugh. I dreamt I saw Bailey, and they were...glowing? And they pointed at Xavier.""
[Message 94] Maya: ""Glowing? That's definitely a dream.""
[Message 95] Chloe: ""I know, I know! But it felt so real. Like it was a sign.""
[Message 96] Maya: ""Could be your subconscious trying to make sense of things.""
[Message 97] Chloe: ""Maybe. Or maybe I'm psychic! 😂""
[Message 98] Maya: ""Haha, maybe! Let's stick to the facts for now.""
[Message 99] Chloe: ""Deal. Just thought I'd share my weirdness.""
[Message 100] Maya: ""Appreciate it. Every detail is important.""
[Message 101] Liam: ""Hey guys, I did some digging on Xavier. Turns out he was fired from his last job for stealing.""
[Message 102] Maya: ""Stealing? That's a new detail.""
[Message 103] Chloe: ""See? He's always been a bit shady.""
[Message 104] Liam: ""And guess who fired him? Bailey. Apparently he intended to make Bailey's life hell for firing him.""
[Message 105] Maya: ""Holy crap, Liam! That's huge.""
[Message 106] Chloe: ""Wow. Okay, Xavier is definitely looking like the prime suspect now.""
[Message 107] Liam: ""I'm calling the police first thing in the morning.""
[Message 108] Maya: ""Me too. I think they're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 109] Chloe: ""Good. He deserves it. I hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 110] Liam: ""He was talking about hurting them right before he went over there.""
[Message 111] Maya: ""He was looking up how to make Electrocution online, too.""
[Message 112] Liam: ""I have to run now, I will talk to you all later""
[Message 113] Chloe: ""Bye Liam""
[Message 114] Maya: ""Byeee""
[Message 115] Maya: ""Hey Chloe, I'm a bit nervous about talking to the police tomorrow.""
[Message 116] Chloe: ""Why? We're just telling the truth.""
[Message 117] Maya: ""I know, but still. All this is so intense.""
[Message 118] Chloe: ""I get it. But we have to do what's right for Bailey. And for ourselves.""
[Message 119] Maya: ""True. Thanks, Chloe. You always know what to say.""
[Message 120] Chloe: ""Anytime, Maya. We're in this together.""
[Message 121] Maya: ""In this together.""
[Message 122] Chloe: ""I saw him leave the building at Dawn.""
[Message 123] Chloe: ""Her shouting probably provoked him.""
[Message 124] Chloe: ""If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.""
[Message 125] Maya: ""Liam called. He has a hunch about you.""
[Message 126] Chloe: ""You are saying I should be careful because he is suspicious of me?""
[Message 127] Maya: ""Yes. But I don't think he will find anything.""
[Message 128] Chloe: ""Thanks, I was buying Electrocution at the store, to prepare for the winter, I will get rid of it just in case.""
[Message 129] Maya: ""Good idea""
[Message 130] Chloe: ""I told him that I had a weird dream. He bought it.""
[Message 131] Maya: ""Good""
[Message 132] Chloe: ""Xavier has been arrested. They think it's him.""
[Message 133] Maya: ""Good. The less we are involved in this, the better.""
[Message 134] Chloe: ""Agreed. We are doing what is right, for ourselves.""

[Message 2] Liam: Hey Kai, yeah, I wouldn't miss it. Horrible what happened.
[Message 3] Kai: Absolutely. Still can't believe it. Did you know her well?
[Message 4] Liam: We talked sometimes, you know, work stuff. She was always ambitious.
[Message 5] Ben: Hey guys, saw the news. Crazy about Sarah. I’m in shock.
[Message 6] Kai: Hey Ben. Yeah, it's awful. They still haven't caught anyone, right?
[Message 7] Ben: Not that I know of. Cops were asking questions at my place all day.
[Message 8] Liam: Questions about what, Ben?
[Message 9] Ben: Just the usual, where was I, did I see anything, blah blah blah.
[Message 10] Kai: Weird. They didn't talk to me yet.
[Message 11] Liam: Me neither. Maybe they're focusing on people who worked closer to Sarah's office.
[Message 12] Ben: Could be. Anyway, gotta run. Catch you guys tomorrow?
[Message 13] Kai: Yep, see you then.
[Message 14] Liam: Later.

[Message 15] Jake: Yo, Marco, you hear about Sarah?
[Message 16] Marco: Yeah, man, messed up. You think they'll find who did it?
[Message 17] Jake: Hope so. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 18] Marco: Seriously. I saw Kyle arguing with her last week, pretty intense.
[Message 19] Jake: Kyle? What were they arguing about?
[Message 20] Marco: Something about Kyle's performance. She was riding him hard.
[Message 21] Jake: Damn. That's...interesting.

[Message 22] Kai: Liam, you think it was a random thing, or someone she knew?
[Message 23] Liam: Honestly, Kai, I have no idea. It's Fayetteville, could be anything.
[Message 24] Kai: True. Still, feels personal, you know?
[Message 25] Liam: Yeah, I get it. The manager rubbed a lot of people the wrong way.
[Message 26] Kai: She did. But murder? That's another level.

[Message 27] Marco: Jake, you still at that church group thing?
[Message 28] Jake: Yeah, almost done. Why?
[Message 29] Marco: Just wondering. You were pretty vocal about your beliefs lately.
[Message 30] Jake: What's that supposed to mean?
[Message 31] Marco: Nothing, man. Just saying.
[Message 32] Jake: Whatever.

[Message 33] Kai: Hey Ben, you seemed stressed yesterday. Everything alright?
[Message 34] Ben: Yeah, Kai, just work stuff. You know how it is.
[Message 35] Kai: Sure. Just checking.

[Message 36] Liam: Anyone know if Sarah had any enemies? Like, *real* enemies?
[Message 37] Marco: She got into it with Kyle. Like Jake said.
[Message 38] Kai: You heard about that too? Small world.
[Message 39] Liam: Office gossip travels fast. But enemies, plural? Anyone else?

[Message 40] Jake: Marco, stop being cryptic. If you have something to say, say it.
[Message 41] Marco: I'm just saying, you seemed pretty anti-Sarah before...you knew her being transgender, right?
[Message 42] Jake: That's low, Marco. Seriously low. My faith is about love, not hate.
[Message 43] Marco: Okay, okay, chill. Just asking a question.
[Message 44] Liam: Guys, can we not? This isn't helping anyone.

[Message 45] Ben: I heard she wanted to get rid of him. Something about HR violation?
[Message 46] Kai: Get rid of who, Ben?
[Message 47] Ben: Doesn't matter. Just heard it from someone. Gossip.
[Message 48] Liam: Gossip is dangerous right now, Ben. Be careful what you spread.

[Message 49] Marco: Jake, if you saw him leave the building at Late Evening, it would look bad.
[Message 50] Jake: Dude, I was at church! I have witnesses!
[Message 51] Marco: Relax, man. Just saying...

[Message 52] Kai: This whole thing is making me paranoid.
[Message 53] Liam: Me too. Feels like everyone's a suspect.
[Message 54] Ben: Especially with how the cops are acting.

[Message 55] Jake: I am not involved. I'm innocent.
[Message 56] Marco: Nobody said you were involved, Jake. Chill.
[Message 57] Jake: It feels like you're implying it.

[Message 58] Liam: Did anyone see anything unusual that night? Anything at all?
[Message 59] Kai: I was at home. Movie night with my wife.
[Message 60] Ben: I was out to dinner with my family.
[Message 61] Liam: Alright, just checking.
[Message 62] Jake: Marco, where were you?
[Message 63] Marco: I went to go see my brother in a nearby town.

[Message 64] Kai: They found Strangulation with a rope at the scene. Awful.
[Message 65] Liam: Jesus. That's brutal.
[Message 66] Ben: Details are getting leaked already?

[Message 67] Marco: Jake, you're pretty handy. Ever look up how to make Strangulation with a rope online?
[Message 68] Jake: What the hell, Marco! Why would you even ask that?!
[Message 69] Marco: Just a hypothetical. Relax.
[Message 70] Liam: Marco, knock it off.

[Message 71] Ben: My neighbor said she saw someone buying Strangulation with a rope at the store that day, but couldn't describe them.
[Message 72] Kai: Ugh, this is getting worse and worse.

[Message 73] Jake: Marco, I swear to God, if you don't stop...
[Message 74] Marco: What? You gonna strangle me with a rope, Jake? See, I'm just kidding!
[Message 75] Liam: Marco, stop fueling the fire!

[Message 76] Kai: I'm going to take a break from this conversation. It's stressing me out too much.
[Message 77] Liam: Good idea, Kai. Me too.
[Message 78] Ben: Agreed.

[Message 79] Marco: Okay, okay, I'll stop. Just saying, someone wanted her gone.
[Message 80] Jake: Who, Marco? Who wanted her gone?
[Message 81] Marco: Doesn't matter now, does it? She's already gone.

[Message 82] Liam: Ben, you said Sarah wanted to ""get rid of"" someone. Who was it and why?
[Message 83] Ben: It was Kyle. The guy she fired. She told me he needed to go and told me to prepare paperwork. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 84] Liam: This is important, Ben. You need to tell the police this.

[Message 85] Marco: Maybe if you called 911 when you found her, she would still be alive.
[Message 86] Jake: I wasn't even there!
[Message 87] Marco: I was talking about Liam. He found her.
[Message 88] Liam: What? I found her the next morning! I called 911 immediately! What are you implying?
[Message 89] Marco: That's what *you* say.

[Message 90] Ben: Liam, did she seem okay when you saw her last?
[Message 91] Liam: I saw her a few days before. She was stressed, but nothing out of the ordinary.
[Message 92] Ben: She didn't mention any threats or anything?
[Message 93] Liam: No.
[Message 94] Kai: Guys stop it.

[Message 95] Jake: I’m going to pray for Sarah's soul. And for justice.
[Message 96] Marco: You do that, Jake.

[Message 97] Ben: I am going to make funeral arangements.
[Message 98] Liam: Okay, that's good, Ben. Thanks.

[Message 99] Marco: He always hated Sarah. He talked about it all the time.
[Message 100] Jake: Who hated her, Marco? You need to be specific.
[Message 101] Marco: Doesn't matter.
[Message 102] Liam: Yes, it does matter! Tell us!

[Message 103] Ben: Marco, stop playing games. You’re scaring everyone.
[Message 104] Marco: Okay, okay. It was Kyle. He always complained about her.

[Message 105] Jake: He's just trying to stir up trouble. Don't listen to him.
[Message 106] Marco: I'm just saying what I heard. He said he wanted to get rid of her.

[Message 107] Liam: This isn't helping, guys. We need to focus on finding the truth, not spreading rumors.
[Message 108] Kai: I agree.

[Message 109] Ben: Maybe we should all just talk to the police separately.
[Message 110] Liam: That's probably the best idea, Ben.
[Message 111] Kai: Yep.

[Message 112] Jake: I have nothing to hide. I’ll cooperate fully.
[Message 113] Marco: Sure, you will.
[Message 114] Jake: What's that supposed to mean?!

[Message 115] Ben: I am going to prepare the obituary.
[Message 116] Liam: Thank you, Ben.

[Message 117] Marco: They'll probably get the death penalty for this. It's Fayetteville, they don't mess around.
[Message 118] Jake: Marco, you're being morbid.
[Message 119] Marco: I'm just saying the truth.

[Message 120] Liam: I’m ending this chat. It’s going nowhere.
[Message 121] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 122] Ben: Same here.

[Message 123] Jake: I'm going offline. Pray for Sarah.
[Message 124] Marco: Bye, Jake.

[Message 125] Liam: Ben, keep me updated on the funeral arrangements.
[Message 126] Ben: Will do.

[Message 127] Marco: It was a politically motivated assassination. I just know it.
[Message 128] Marco: I told Jake and Liam that she was transgender and it got a reaction.
[Message 129] Kai: Hey Liam, you going to that concert next weekend? I got extra tickets
[Message 130] Liam: Hey Kai, Yeah I remember! Been looking forward to it.
[Message 131] Ben: Hey guys, going to sleep. The cops exhausted me.
[Message 132] Kai: Okay, Ben. Get some rest.

[Message 133] Liam: Maybe you should too, Marco.
[Message 134] Marco: Lol. Okay.
[Message 135] Liam: Hey Jake, let's go grab a bite after the memorial to get your mind off of things.
[Message 136] Jake: Cool with me, man.
[Message 137] Liam: Ben, get the details from the church group and let me know.

[Message 138] Marco: Hey! Don't talk about me behind my back.

[Message 139] Ben: Going to sleep.
[Message 140] Kai: Good night!
[Message 141] Jake: Good night!
[Message 142] Liam: Good night!
[Message 143] Marco: What an anticlimactic conversation.
[Message 144] Jake: Okay I need to run
[Message 145] Liam: Sure buddy.
[Message 146] Ben: Later
[Message 147] Kai: Ok.

[Message 148] Jake: Her shouting probably provoked him to violence
[Message 149] Marco: Good night yall I am going to sleep now fr this time.
[Message 150] Liam: Ben, I hope you are fine
[Message 151] Kai: Let's make sure we get together after memorial. It will be good for us.

[Message 152] Jake: Marco always has something to say to push peoples buttons.

131,"[Message 1] Liam: Hey everyone! Dusk at Convention Hall, ready for some theater talk?
[Message 2] Alex: Ready as I'll ever be! What's on the agenda?
[Message 3] Sam: I saw a flyer for a new play, ""Echoes of Yesterday."" Anyone heard of it?
[Message 4] River: ""Echoes of Yesterday""? Sounds intriguing. What's it about, Sam?
[Message 5] Quinn: Ooh, theater! I'm in! Late as usual, sorry.
[Message 6] Sam: It's supposed to be about a teacher-student conference gone wrong, set in the 1920s.
[Message 7] Liam: A teacher-student conference? That's an odd setting for a play.
[Message 8] Alex: Could be interesting! I'm always up for something different.
[Message 9] River: The 1920s setting has me hooked already! Flapper dresses and jazz music, maybe?
[Message 10] Quinn: Teacher-student anything makes me shudder. Reminds me of all those parent-teacher nights...
[Message 11] Liam: Haha, Quinn, I feel you. But a *dramatic* teacher-student conference sounds way more exciting.
[Message 12] Alex: Anyone been to this theater before? The Convention Hall one?
[Message 13] Sam: I think it's the first time they're doing a proper theatrical production there. Usually it's conferences.
[Message 14] River: That's good to know. Makes it even more of an adventure.
[Message 15] Quinn: Has anyone checked reviews or anything? I'm always a little wary of brand new productions.
[Message 16] Liam: I looked quickly – not much out there yet, being so new.
[Message 17] Alex: We could be the trendsetters! The first to review ""Echoes of Yesterday""!
[Message 18] Sam: I like your thinking, Alex!
[Message 19] River: Alright, I'm officially in. Let's go see it! When are we thinking?
[Message 20] Quinn: Before I commit, what kind of play is it? Comedy? Drama? Tragic historical reenactment of a bad parent-teacher conference?
[Message 21] Liam: Sam, do you know?
[Message 22] Sam: It's billed as a ""dramatic exploration of generational divides and unspoken truths.""
[Message 23] Alex: Ooh, heavy.
[Message 24] River: I'm even more intrigued now. Generational divides – that's definitely relevant.
[Message 25] Quinn: ""Unspoken truths""... *ominous music plays in my head*
[Message 26] Liam: Okay, so drama it is. Should we try for opening night? It’s next Friday.
[Message 27] Alex: Opening night sounds good! More exciting.
[Message 28] Sam: Works for me!
[Message 29] River: I'm in! Opening night it is!
[Message 30] Quinn: Alright, alright, you've twisted my arm. Opening night sounds suitably dramatic.
[Message 31] Liam: Great! I'll try to snag some tickets. Does everyone have preferences on seating?
[Message 32] Alex: Not too close to the stage, please. I like to see the whole picture.
[Message 33] Sam: Middle is always good for me!
[Message 34] River: Same here, middle section!
[Message 35] Quinn: Anywhere that's not directly under a speaker. My ears are sensitive.
[Message 36] Liam: Noted! I'll aim for middle section, not too close, and away from speakers, if possible.
[Message 37] Alex: You're the best, Liam!
[Message 38] Sam: Thanks, Liam!
[Message 39] River: Appreciate it, Liam!
[Message 40] Quinn: Thanks Liam!
[Message 41] Liam: No problem! Just doing my civic duty of facilitating theater outings.
[Message 42] Alex: Speaking of civic duty, anyone else dreading jury duty? I got summoned again.
[Message 43] Sam: Oh no! I managed to avoid it so far. Good luck, Alex!
[Message 44] River: Ugh, jury duty is the worst. Hope you get dismissed quickly, Alex.
[Message 45] Quinn: Jury duty. The epitome of drama, but the wrong kind.
[Message 46] Liam: Back to theater! Once I get the tickets, I'll let everyone know.
[Message 47] Alex: Sounds good! Maybe we can grab dinner before the show?
[Message 48] Sam: That's a great idea, Alex!
[Message 49] River: Dinner before sounds perfect!
[Message 50] Quinn: I'm in for dinner! I'll need sustenance to survive the ""generational divides and unspoken truths.""
[Message 51] Liam: Dinner it is then! I know a decent Italian place near the Convention Hall.
[Message 52] Alex: Italian sounds amazing!
[Message 53] Sam: Perfect!

[Message 2] Ben: ""Yeah, I saw it on the news. Crazy. Louisville is going downhill fast.""
[Message 3] Chloe: ""Heard. Was anybody I know involved?""
[Message 4] Alex: ""I heard it was someone named Jamie, a social worker.""
[Message 5] Ben: ""Jamie? Never heard of her. What happened exactly?""
[Message 6] Chloe: ""An explosion. At sunset. Apparently, she was right where it went off.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Supposedly it was a disagreement with a business rival, but who knows. ""
[Message 8] Ben: ""Business rival? Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it?""
[Message 9] Chloe: ""Maybe she had something coming. Some people just rub others the wrong way.""
[Message 10] Alex: ""Chloe! That's a terrible thing to say. Jamie was an anxious soul.""
[Message 11] Ben: ""Yeah, Chloe, show some respect.""
[Message 12] Chloe: ""Okay, okay, chill out. Just saying, there's always two sides.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""They're saying whoever did it might face some serious time.""
[Message 14] Ben: ""They should. No tolerance for that kind of violence. Especially in our city.""
[Message 15] Chloe: ""Hey, Alex, remember that time you were looking up Explosive device online? Just curious…""
[Message 16] Alex: ""What? Chloe, what are you implying? That's insane! I was researching something for a project, nothing illegal.""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Easy, Alex. Chloe's just being Chloe. What were you researching anyway?""
[Message 18] Alex: ""It doesn't matter. The point is, I would never do something like that.""
[Message 19] Chloe: ""If you say so. I just remember you saying that the manager, was really annoying.""
[Message 20] Alex: ""That's completely different! Annoying is not a reason to blow someone up!""
[Message 21] Ben: ""Guys, let's not accuse each other. The police will figure it out.""
[Message 22] Chloe: ""True. I was at home all evening, anyways.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Me too, I was watching that new documentary on Netflix. ""
[Message 24] Ben: ""I was at that concert downtown. Huge crowd, lots of witnesses.""
[Message 25] Chloe: ""Ben, did you say anything to Jamie, 10. Social Worker before? ""
[Message 26] Ben: ""I've never even met Jamie. What are you trying to get at?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""I heard the explosion was super loud. Did you hear anything from where you were, Ben?""
[Message 28] Ben: ""No, the music was way too loud to hear anything else. It was insane.""
[Message 29] Chloe: ""Makes sense. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 30] Alex: ""Yeah, you're right. Louisville ain't gonna let this one slide.""
[Message 31] Ben: ""Did they find anything at the scene? Like who purposefully caused the explosion?""
[Message 32] Chloe: ""I heard they're looking for someone with crooked teeth. Weird detail, right?""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Crooked teeth? That's a strange description. Why do you think they needed to mention that, maybe it was obvious""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Maybe someone saw them. Or it was caught on camera.""
[Message 35] Chloe: ""Could be a red herring. The police are always throwing those out there.""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Speaking of cameras, I hope they check the Library's security footage. I was aware that the explosion killed Jamie.""
[Message 37] Ben: ""Definitely. And phone records. Everyone leaves a trail these days.""
[Message 38] Chloe: ""True. I wonder if Jamie had any enemies. I bet she knew it was going to happen.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Chloe, stop it! You're being insensitive and making assumptions.
[Message 40] Ben: ""Agree, Alex. Let the investigators do their job. We dont know the entire story.""
[Message 41] Chloe: ""Okay, okay. Just saying. ""
[Message 42] Alex: ""This whole thing is just so disturbing. Hope they catch whoever did it soon. ""
[Message 43] Ben: ""Me too. Louisville needs some peace. ""

[Message 2] Eleanor: Hi Liam! Well, I'm hoping to finally get my vegetable garden properly organized next spring.
[Message 3] George: Evening. I’m planning on finally learning that blues scale on my harmonica. Been putting it off for too long.
[Message 4] Liam: That's awesome, George! Harmonica sounds like a great skill to have. Eleanor, what vegetables are you planning on growing?
[Message 5] Eleanor: Everything! Tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce... the works! Need to get a better system for staking the tomatoes this year.
[Message 6] George: Tomatoes are tricky. They always seem to attract pests.
[Message 7] Liam: Yeah, they do. I'm thinking of taking a trip to the library soon. I've been meaning to read up on some project management methodologies.
[Message 8] Eleanor: The library is a great place. Peaceful.
[Message 9] George: Peaceful indeed. I prefer a bit more noise when I'm practicing my music, though.
[Message 10] Liam: Makes sense. Different strokes for different folks, right?
[Message 11] Eleanor: Exactly. Speaking of which, Liam, how's the project at work going?
[Message 12] Liam: It's...challenging. We're nearing a deadline and things are getting a bit hectic. Need to give some feedback to Sarah about her presentation.
[Message 13] George: Giving feedback is always tough.
[Message 14] Eleanor: Agreed. Especially when it's constructive criticism.
[Message 15] Liam: Right? I want to be helpful, but I don't want to discourage her.
[Message 16] George: Maybe focus on the strengths first, then gently suggest improvements.
[Message 17] Eleanor: That's a good approach, George. Sandwich method.
[Message 18] Liam: ""Sandwich method,"" I like that! I'll keep that in mind.
[Message 19] George: Been using it for years. Works most of the time.
[Message 20] Eleanor: So, George, what kind of harmonica are you planning to use?
[Message 21] George: A Hohner Marine Band. It's a classic.
[Message 22] Liam: I've heard good things about those.
[Message 23] Eleanor: My brother plays the harmonica. He says practice is key.
[Message 24] George: Practice, practice, practice. That's the motto.
[Message 25] Liam: Definitely applies to project management too!
[Message 26] Eleanor: Everything, really.
[Message 27] George: So true.
[Message 28] Liam: Thinking further ahead, I'd really like to mentor a younger project manager someday.
[Message 29] Eleanor: That's a noble goal, Liam.
[Message 30] George: Passing on your knowledge is important.
[Message 31] Liam: I think so. I've learned so much from others over the years.
[Message 32] Eleanor: I try to share my gardening tips with my neighbors.
[Message 33] George: I occasionally play for the residents at the assisted living facility.
[Message 34] Liam: That's wonderful, George.
[Message 35] Eleanor: Very kind of you.
[Message 36] Liam: It's nice to give back to the community.
[Message 37] Eleanor: Absolutely. Makes you feel good too.
[Message 38] George: It does. A little bit of kindness goes a long way.
[Message 39] Liam: So, Eleanor, what's your secret to growing such healthy tomatoes?
[Message 40] Eleanor: Plenty of sunshine, good soil, and regular watering. And talking to them!
[Message 41] George: Talking to plants?
[Message 42] Eleanor: It sounds silly, but I swear it helps!
[Message 43] Liam: Haha, I might have to try that.
[Message 44] George: I'll stick to talking to my harmonica.
[Message 45] Eleanor: Whatever works!
[Message 46] Liam: By the way, did either of you see that documentary about Salt Lake City history last week?
[Message 47] Eleanor: I missed it. Was it any good?
[Message 48] George: I was watching a ballgame, unfortunately.
[Message 49] Liam: It was really interesting! Showed a lot of old photos and talked about the early settlers.
[Message 50] Eleanor: I'll have to see if I can find it online.
[Message 51] George: Maybe it's on the library's streaming service.
[Message 52] Liam: Good idea, George! I'll check that out too.
[Message 53] Eleanor: So, back to gardening... what kind of soil do you recommend, George?
[Message 54] George: For tomatoes? I'd say something slightly acidic.
[Message 55] Liam: Huh, good to know!
[Message 56] Eleanor: Thanks, George! I'll keep that in mind when I'm prepping the beds.
[Message 57] Liam: I'm actually thinking of taking a class on permaculture sometime.
[Message 58] Eleanor: Permaculture? What's that?
[Message 59] George: Sustainable gardening, I think.
[Message 60] Liam: Exactly! Creating a self-sustaining ecosystem.
[Message 61] Eleanor: Sounds complicated!
[Message 62] George: But rewarding, I imagine.
[Message 63] Liam: That's the goal.
[Message 64] Eleanor: Well, good luck with that, Liam!
[Message 65] George: I'll stick to my harmonica and simple gardening.
[Message 66] Liam: Fair enough!
[Message 67] Eleanor: The soup kitchen is getting quite busy tonight.
[Message 68] George: It is. Glad we could all make it.
[Message 69] Liam: Me too. It's good to connect.
[Message 70] Eleanor: Especially with the long winter nights coming.
[Message 71] George: Absolutely.
[Message 72] Liam: Speaking of winter, anyone have any fun plans for the holidays?
[Message 73] Eleanor: Just spending time with family, I think.
[Message 74] George: Same here. Quiet and peaceful.
[Message 75] Liam: Sounds lovely.
[Message 76] Eleanor: Maybe I'll try making some homemade preserves.
[Message 77] George: That sounds delicious!
[Message 78] Liam: You're making me hungry!
[Message 79] Eleanor: Haha!
[Message 80] George: I might try to learn a Christmas carol on the harmonica.
[Message 81] Liam: That would be amazing, George!
[Message 82] Eleanor: I'd love to hear that!
[Message 83] George: I'll see what I can do.
[Message 84] Liam: So, Eleanor, any tips for keeping deer out of the garden?
[Message 85] Eleanor: Ugh, deer are the worst! I use netting and sometimes sprinkle cayenne pepper around the plants.
[Message 86] George: Cayenne pepper? Interesting.
[Message 87] Liam: I've heard that works.
[Message 88] Eleanor: They don't like the smell or taste.
[Message 89] George: Smart.
[Message 90] Liam: I'll have to try that next year.
[Message 91] Eleanor: Good luck!
[Message 92] George: I'm just hoping to keep the squirrels away from my bird feeder.
[Message 93] Liam: Squirrels are persistent little creatures.
[Message 94] Eleanor: Very!
[Message 95] George: I've tried everything!
[Message 96] Liam: Maybe a baffle?
[Message 97] Eleanor: What's a baffle?
[Message 98] George: A shield around the pole that they can't climb.
[Message 99] Liam: Yeah, exactly.
[Message 100] Eleanor: I'll look into that. Thanks!
[Message 101] George: No problem.
[Message 102] Liam: Well, this has been a nice chat. Thanks for sharing your plans and tips!
[Message 103] Eleanor: You too, Liam!
[Message 104] George: Likewise.
[Message 105] Liam: I should probably head out soon. Got to get up early tomorrow for that meeting.
[Message 106] Eleanor: Good luck with the meeting!
[Message 107] George: Hope it goes well.
[Message 108] Liam: Thanks!
[Message 109] Eleanor: I'm going to stay a bit longer and enjoy the soup.
[Message 110] George: Me too. It's quite good tonight.
[Message 111] Liam: Alright, well, have a good night, you two!
[Message 112] Eleanor: You too, Liam! Safe travels.
[Message 113] George: Good night.
[Message 114] Eleanor: So, George, how long have you been playing the harmonica?
[Message 115] George: On and off for about 20 years. Never really got serious about it, though.
[Message 116] Eleanor: That's still a long time!
[Message 117] George: It is. But I'm hoping to dedicate more time to it now that I'm retired.
[Message 118] Eleanor: That's a great goal.
[Message 119] George: What about you and gardening? How long have you been doing that?
[Message 120] Eleanor: Since I was a little girl. My grandmother taught me.
[Message 121] George: That's wonderful. Passing down traditions.
[Message 122] Eleanor: Exactly. It's a connection to the past.
[Message 123] George: I understand that. Music does the same for me.
[Message 124] Eleanor: So true.
[Message 125] George: Speaking of which, I might play a little tune before I head out.
[Message 126] Eleanor: Please do!
[Message 127] George: (Plays a short blues riff on his harmonica)
[Message 128] Eleanor: Beautiful, George!
[Message 129] George: Thanks! Just a little something.
[Message 130] Eleanor: It brightened my evening.
[Message 131] George: I'm glad.
[Message 132] Eleanor: Well, I should probably get going too. It's getting late.
[Message 133] George: Alright. Walk safe.
[Message 134] Eleanor: You too, George.
[Message 135] George: Good night.
[Message 136] Eleanor: Good night!

[Message 138] Eleanor: (Texts back) Me too! Sleep well.

[Message 140] Eleanor: (Texts back to Liam) Did you remember to give Sarah that feedback?
[Message 141] Liam: (Texts back to Eleanor) Not yet. Will do it first thing tomorrow. Procrastination is a terrible habit!
[Message 142] Eleanor: (Texts back to Liam) Tell me about it! I keep putting off weeding the flower beds.

[Message 145] Liam: (Texts back to Eleanor) Thanks! Will report back tomorrow.
[Message 146] Eleanor: (Texts back to Liam) Sounds good!
[Message 147] George: (Texts back to Eleanor) I'm thinking of trying a different key harmonica. Any recommendations?
[Message 148] Eleanor: (Texts back to George) I'm not sure, George! My brother always just used a C harmonica.
[Message 149] George: (Texts back to Eleanor) Hmmm, okay. I'll do some research.
[Message 150] Eleanor: (Texts back to George) There are probably some good forums online.
[Message 151] George: (Texts back to Eleanor) Good point! Thanks.
[Message 152] Liam: (Texts back to all) Just a random thought - anyone else find it hard to throw away old books?
[Message 153] Eleanor: (Texts back to Liam) Oh, me too! I have stacks of them.
[Message 154] George: (Texts back to Liam) I donate them to the library.
[Message 155] Liam: (Texts back to George) That's a great idea!
[Message 156] Eleanor: (Texts back to Liam) Much better than hoarding them like I do!
[Message 157] Liam: (Texts back to Eleanor) Haha! Well, I feel less guilty now.
[Message 158] Eleanor: (Texts back to Liam) Glad I could help!
[Message 159] George: (Texts back to all) Alright, truly goodnight this time.
[Message 160] Eleanor: (Texts back to all) Night!
[Message 161] Liam: (Texts back to all) Sleep tight!
[Message 162] Eleanor: (Texts back to Liam) You too! And good luck with that Sarah tomorrow.
[Message 163] Liam: (Texts back to Eleanor) Thanks! I'll need it!
[Message 164] Eleanor: (Texts back to Liam) You got this!
[Message 165] George: (Texts back to all) Don't stay up too late texting!
[Message 166] Eleanor: (Texts back to George) Guilty!
[Message 167] Liam: (Texts back to all) Okay, okay, I'm going to bed now!
[Message 168] Eleanor: (Texts back to Liam) Sweet dreams!
[Message 169] George: (Texts back to Liam) Same to you.

[Message 27] Alex: Thinking about the section in North Carolina. Heard it's beautiful.

[Message 28] Sarah: Ooh, North Carolina is lovely! Have you been before?

[Message 29] Ben: I've driven through North Carolina. Gorgeous scenery.

[Message 30] Emily: I've always wanted to visit Asheville.

[Message 31] David: I'm grateful for the beauty of nature. It's so calming.

[Message 32] Alex: Totally agree, David.

[Message 33] Sarah: Speaking of calming, what kind of music is everyone listening to these days?

[Message 34] Ben: Been on a jazz kick lately. Miles Davis is my go-to.

[Message 35] Emily: I'm all about indie rock.

[Message 36] David: I enjoy classical music. Beethoven always lifts my spirits.

[Message 37] Alex: I like folk music when I'm hiking.

[Message 38] Sarah: I listen to podcasts mostly. True crime, surprisingly.

[Message 39] Ben: Interesting! I'm grateful for good music. It always puts me in a better mood.

[Message 40] Emily: Me too!

[Message 41] David: Sarah, even though it's slightly off-topic, but are there any good book recommendations based on your podcast interest?

[Message 42] Sarah: Surprisingly yes! ""I'll Be Gone in the Dark"" by Michelle McNamara.

[Message 43] Ben: I saw that on HBO! Great doc.

[Message 44] Emily: I’ve heard great things.

[Message 45] David: I'm grateful for the freedom to choose what I want to listen to and read.

[Message 46] Alex: A very important freedom.

[Message 47] Sarah: Agreed.

[Message 48] Ben: Absolutely.

[Message 49] Emily: Definitely.

[Message 50] David: So Ben, any travel companion for that Miami road trip?

[Message 51] Ben: Thinking about asking my brother. He's always up for an adventure.

[Message 52] Alex: Road trips are always better with company!

[Message 53] Sarah: Agreed. Someone to share the driving.

[Message 54] Emily: And the snacks!

[Message 55] David: Snacks are crucial.

[Message 56] Alex: I’m grateful for the opportunity to connect with family and friends.

[Message 57] Sarah: That's a lovely sentiment, Alex.

[Message 58] Ben: Beautifully said.

[Message 59] Emily: Totally agree.

[Message 60] David: Definitely.

[Message 61] David: Emily, is coding work related or a hobby?

[Message 62] Emily: A bit of both! I'm trying to incorporate it into my work, but I also enjoy it as a hobby.

[Message 63] Alex: Sounds like a good balance.

[Message 64] Sarah: I'm grateful for hobbies that keep my mind active.

[Message 65] Ben: Me too. Keeps the boredom at bay.

[Message 66] Emily: Exactly!

[Message 67] David: I'm grateful for the ability to learn new things, no matter my age.

[Message 68] Alex: Age is just a number!

[Message 69] Sarah: So true!

[Message 70] Ben: Couldn't agree more.

[Message 71] Emily: Absolutely!

[Message 72] David: Back to travel plans, I'm grateful for the opportunity to travel and see the world.

[Message 73] Alex: Where have you been lately, David?

[Message 74] Sarah: Yes, tell us about your recent travels!

[Message 75] Ben: I'm curious too!

[Message 76] Emily: Spill the beans!

[Message 77] David: I just got back from a trip to Italy. The art and architecture were breathtaking.

[Message 78] Alex: Italy! That's on my bucket list.

[Message 79] Sarah: Me too! The food!

[Message 80] Ben: I've heard amazing things.

[Message 81] Emily: I want to go someday!

[Message 82] David: You all should go! I highly recommend it.

[Message 83] Alex: What was your favorite part, David?

[Message 84] Sarah: Yes, what's a must-see?

[Message 85] Ben: Give us the inside scoop!

[Message 86] Emily: I need to know!

[Message 87] David: Probably the Vatican. The sheer scale of St. Peter's Basilica is awe-inspiring.

[Message 88] Alex: Wow. That sounds incredible.

[Message 89] Sarah: Definitely adding that to my list.

[Message 90] Ben: Me too.

[Message 91] Emily: Thanks for the tip!

[Message 92] David: I'm grateful for art and culture. It enriches our lives.

[Message 93] Alex: Absolutely. It broadens our perspectives.

[Message 94] Sarah: Agreed.

[Message 95] Ben: Couldn't agree more.

[Message 96] Emily: Definitely.

[Message 97] David: Speaking of enriching, Sarah, what kind of home improvement projects are you thinking about?

[Message 98] Sarah: I'm thinking about redoing my kitchen backsplash. Something bright and cheerful.

[Message 99] Alex: That sounds fun!

[Message 100] Ben: Nice!

[Message 101] Emily: I love a good kitchen makeover.

[Message 102] David: I'm grateful for the ability to create a comfortable and beautiful home.

[Message 103] Alex: A sanctuary.

[Message 104] Sarah: Exactly.

[Message 105] Ben: Well said.

[Message 106] Emily: Totally.

[Message 107] David: I'm grateful for this conversation. It's nice to connect with all of you.

[Message 108] Alex: Me too, David.

[Message 109] Sarah: Same here.

[Message 110] Ben: Agreed.

[Message 111] Emily: Definitely!

[Message 112] David: By the way, anyone know a good local place to get some nice artisan bread?

[Message 113] Alex: The bakery on Main Street is supposed to be amazing.

[Message 114] Sarah: I've heard good things about that place too.

[Message 115] Ben: I'll have to check it out!

[Message 116] Emily: Thanks for the recommendation!

[Message 117] David: Great! I'll try it out. I'm grateful for good food!

[Message 118] Alex: Who isn’t?

[Message 119] Sarah: A universal joy.

[Message 120] Ben: Absolutely.

[Message 121] Emily: Definitely.

[Message 122] David: Ben, any particular type of music you like while driving on road trips?

[Message 123] Ben: Classic rock, mostly. Gotta have some Springsteen and The Eagles.

[Message 124] Alex: Good choices!

[Message 125] Sarah: Road trip staples.

[Message 126] Emily: Can't go wrong with that.

[Message 127] David: Perfect for cruising.

[Message 128] Alex: I'm grateful for the memories associated with certain songs.

[Message 129] Sarah: Me too. Music is so evocative.

[Message 130] Ben: Totally agree.

[Message 131] Emily: Absolutely.

[Message 132] David: So, back to gratitude, what's one thing you're grateful for that you often take for granted?

[Message 133] Alex: Clean water.

[Message 134] Sarah: Access to education.

[Message 135] Ben: A roof over my head.

[Message 136] Emily: The ability to communicate with others.

[Message 137] David: Those are all very important. I'm grateful for electricity. We rely on it so much.

[Message 138] Alex: So true!

[Message 139] Sarah: Me too.

[Message 140] Ben: Definitely.

[Message 141] Emily: Absolutely.

[Message 142] David: I'm grateful for the simple things in life.

[Message 143] Alex: It’s all about perspective, right?

[Message 144] Sarah: Exactly.

[Message 145] Ben: Couldn’t agree more.

[Message 146] Emily: Definitely.

[Message 147] David: Alex, what kind of gear do you need for hiking the Appalachian Trail?

[Message 148] Alex: Good hiking boots are essential. And a reliable backpack.

[Message 149] Sarah: Don't forget sunscreen!

[Message 150] Ben: And plenty of water.

[Message 151] Emily: And a map!

[Message 152] David: All good points! I'm grateful for the knowledge and experience of others.

[Message 153] Alex: We learn from each other.

[Message 154] Sarah: That's what makes life interesting.

[Message 155] Ben: Absolutely.

[Message 156] Emily: Definitely.

[Message 157] David: Well, it's getting late. I'm grateful for this morning and this conversation.

[Message 158] Alex: Me too, David. Thanks for starting this thread!

[Message 159] Sarah: Yes, thank you!

[Message 160] Ben: Appreciate it.

[Message 161] Emily: Thanks, David!

[Message 162] David: Have a wonderful day, everyone!

[Message 163] Alex: You too, David!

[Message 164] Sarah: You as well!

[Message 165] Ben: You too!

[Message 166] Emily: Have a great day!

[Message 167] David: Oh, one last thing - I saw a great sale on gardening tools. Thought you might be interested, Sarah.

[Message 168] Sarah: Oh, thank you, David! That's very thoughtful. Where was the sale?

[Message 169] Alex: Good looking out, David!

[Message 170] Ben: That's kind of you.

[Message 171] Emily: So nice!

[Message 172] David: At Home Depot.

[Message 173] Sarah: Perfect! I'll check it out. Thanks again!

[Message 174] Alex: I'm grateful for acts of kindness.

[Message 175] Sarah: Me too!

[Message 176] Ben: It makes a difference.

[Message 177] Emily: Definitely.

[Message 178] David: Have a great time gardening!

[Message 179] Sarah: I will!

[Message 180] Alex: Enjoy the sunshine, Sarah!

[Message 181] Ben: May your flowers bloom!

[Message 182] Emily: Have fun!

[Message 183] David: Okay, really heading out now. Have a wonderful rest of your day!

[Message 184] Alex: Bye David!

137,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Did you guys hear about what happened at the Bakery?""
[Message 2] Sam: ""Yeah, crazy. Two dead.""
[Message 3] Jordan: ""I know, right? Awful. Who were they?""
[Message 4] Alex: ""I heard it was that new cop, Officer Davis, and Judge Thompson.""
[Message 5] Sam: ""Judge Thompson? Wow. I actually had a case in front of him once. Total hardass.""
[Message 6] Jordan: ""Seriously? What was it about?""
[Message 7] Sam: ""Just a minor thing, shoplifting. He threw the book at me. I always hated law enforcement Officer.""
[Message 8] Alex: ""Arson by setting a fire is a hell of a way to go.""
[Message 9] Jordan: ""Hey, Alex, are you still planning on coming over this weekend?""
[Message 10] Alex: ""Yeah, definitely. We still on for board games?""
[Message 11] Jordan: ""Yep! I got a new one I think you'll like.""
[Message 12] Sam: ""Sounds fun. Wish I could join, but I'm working.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Bummer, man. Maybe next time.""
[Message 14] Jordan: ""So, this fire… any idea what happened?""
[Message 15] Sam: ""Heard it was accidental. Faulty wiring or something.""
[Message 16] Alex: ""That's what they're saying? Seems fishy.""
[Message 17] Jordan: ""Why do you say that, Alex?""
[Message 18] Alex: ""Just a feeling. I saw him leave the building at Midday that day. Seemed rushed.""
[Message 19] Sam: ""Who? Thompson?""
[Message 20] Alex: ""No, I saw him leaving the building. That guy that work there. But you didn't hear that from me.""
[Message 21] Jordan: ""Right…""
[Message 22] Sam: ""Anyway, gotta get back to work. Talk later.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Later, Sam.""
[Message 24] Jordan: ""Bye.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""This whole thing is messed up.""
[Message 26] Jordan: ""It is. Just try not to think about it too much, okay?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Easier said than done.""
[Message 28] Jordan: ""I know. Hey, want to order pizza tonight?""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Sounds good. My treat.""
[Message 30] Jordan: ""Cool! I'm starving.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Did you get the ingredients for that ritual thing we talked about?""
[Message 32] Jordan: ""Yeah, everything's ready. Just waiting for the right time.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Okay. Just be careful, alright?""
[Message 34] Jordan: ""Always am.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""This weekend should be fun. We deserve a break.""
[Message 36] Jordan: ""Definitely. I need to unwind.""
[Message 37] Sam: ""Anyone know if Davis had a family? Feel bad for them.""
[Message 38] Alex: ""I think he was married. Young kid, maybe?""
[Message 39] Jordan: ""Tragic. Hope they catch whoever did this.""
[Message 40] Sam: ""They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Yeah, they deserve it.""
[Message 42] Jordan: ""Absolutely.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""I'm going to head out for a bit. Need to clear my head.""
[Message 44] Jordan: ""Okay. Be safe.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Always am.""
[Message 46] Sam: ""Hey Jordan, you remember that time Thompson threw out that case just because the guy was trans?""
[Message 47] Jordan: ""Vaguely. Why?""
[Message 48] Sam: ""Just saying, the guy was a piece of work. Justice finally caught up with him.""
[Message 49] Jordan: ""That's a pretty harsh thing to say, Sam.""
[Message 50] Sam: ""Just being honest. He ruined a lot of lives.""
[Message 51] Jordan: ""Still…""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Back. Grabbed some coffee. Feeling slightly better.""
[Message 53] Jordan: ""Good. Glad to hear it.""
[Message 54] Sam: ""Hey Alex, did you ever get that new part for your car?""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Nah, still saving up. It's expensive.""
[Message 56] Sam: ""Bummer. Need a ride anywhere?""
[Message 57] Alex: ""I'm good, thanks. Appreciate it, though.""
[Message 58] Jordan: ""Anyone watching that true crime show on Netflix?""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Which one?""
[Message 60] Jordan: ""The one about the cult in Oregon. It's wild.""
[Message 61] Sam: ""Cults are scary stuff.""
[Message 62] Alex: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 63] Jordan: ""It makes you wonder what people are capable of.""
[Message 64] Alex: ""Too true.""
[Message 65] Sam: ""Well, back to the grind. Later, guys.""
[Message 66] Alex: ""Later, Sam.""
[Message 67] Jordan: ""Bye.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Jordan, did you hear anything else about the Bakery fire?""
[Message 69] Jordan: ""Just what's on the news. Why?""
[Message 70] Alex: ""No reason. Just curious.""
[Message 71] Jordan: ""Okay…""
[Message 72] Alex: ""Did he always hated 1.  Law Enforcement Officer?""
[Message 73] Jordan: ""Who?""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Thompson. Did he like Davis?""
[Message 75] Jordan: ""I have no idea, Alex. Why are you so focused on this?""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Just trying to understand what happened. It's bothering me.""
[Message 77] Jordan: ""I get it, but maybe you should let the police handle it.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""Yeah, maybe you're right.""
[Message 79] Jordan: ""Definitely.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Think they'll catch him? It's a small town.""
[Message 81] Sam: ""Heard they found some accelerant at the scene. Definitely Arson by setting a fire.""
[Message 82] Jordan: ""Seriously? That's awful.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""So much for faulty wiring.""
[Message 84] Sam: ""Yep. Someone wanted them dead.""
[Message 85] Jordan: ""I can't believe it.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""The world is a messed up place.""
[Message 87] Sam: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 88] Jordan: ""Anyway, I'm going to make some tea. Anyone want some?""
[Message 89] Alex: ""I'm good, thanks.""
[Message 90] Sam: ""No, thanks.""
[Message 91] Jordan: ""Okay. Just thought I'd offer.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""Appreciate it.""
[Message 93] Sam: ""Later, I have to attend to the baby. She is been crying all day""
[Message 94] Alex: ""Bye.""
[Message 95] Jordan: ""Hope you get some rest""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Do you ever think about running away?""
[Message 97] Jordan: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Just packing up and leaving. Starting over somewhere new.""
[Message 99] Jordan: ""Sometimes, yeah. But where would we go?""
[Message 100] Alex: ""Somewhere where nobody knows us. Somewhere peaceful.""
[Message 101] Jordan: ""Sounds nice, but it's not realistic, Alex.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""I know, I know. Just a thought.""
[Message 103] Jordan: ""Hey, I'm going to watch a movie. Want to join?""
[Message 104] Alex: ""What are you watching?""
[Message 105] Jordan: ""Just some dumb rom-com. Need something light.""
[Message 106] Alex: ""Okay, I'll come watch with you.""
[Message 107] Jordan: ""Great! Be right there.""
[Message 108] Sam: ""Anyone know if they have suspects yet?""
[Message 109] Alex: ""Haven't heard anything.""
[Message 110] Jordan: ""Me neither.""
[Message 111] Sam: ""They need to catch this guy. Before he hurts someone else.""
[Message 112] Alex: ""Agreed.""
[Message 113] Jordan: ""Absolutely.""
[Message 114] Alex: ""I wonder what Thompson was working on before he died.""
[Message 115] Jordan: ""Probably a lot of cases. He was a judge.""
[Message 116] Alex: ""Yeah, but maybe something specific. Something that made someone want him dead.""
[Message 117] Jordan: ""You're really fixated on this, Alex.""
[Message 118] Alex: ""I can't help it. It's just... disturbing.""
[Message 119] Jordan: ""I get it. But don't let it consume you.""
[Message 120] Alex: ""I'm trying not to.""
[Message 121] Jordan: ""That's all I ask.""
[Message 122] Sam: ""Just saw on the news that they're looking for anyone who had a grudge against Thompson or Davis.""
[Message 123] Alex: ""That's a lot of people, probably.""
[Message 124] Jordan: ""True. Thompson wasn't exactly popular.""
[Message 125] Sam: ""No kidding. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 126] Alex: ""He was looking up how to make Arson by setting a fire online.""
[Message 127] Jordan: ""Who was?""
[Message 128] Alex: ""Oh, nothing. Just something I read online. Nevermind""
[Message 129] Jordan: ""Okay…""
[Message 130] Alex: ""I have to go""
[Message 131] Jordan: ""Where""
[Message 132] Alex: ""Out""
[Message 133] Jordan: ""Okay""
[Message 134] Sam: ""Heard the police were taking a look at employee records. Someone might have snapped.""
[Message 135] Alex: ""That makes sense.""
[Message 136] Jordan: ""It does. A lot of pressure working at the Bakery, I bet.""
[Message 137] Sam: ""Yep. Especially with that Thompson breathing down everyone's necks.""
[Message 138] Alex: ""Did he know she was buying Arson by setting a fire at the store?""
[Message 139] Jordan: ""Who are you talking about, Alex?""
[Message 140] Alex: ""I'm just saying. Everyone will get it.""
[Message 141] Jordan: ""Right...""
[Message 142] Sam: ""Well, I'm going to try to get some sleep. Exhausted.""
[Message 143] Alex: ""Goodnight.""
[Message 144] Jordan: ""Goodnight, Sam.""

138,"Here's a 125-message conversation reflecting the scenario, characters, and requirements you've outlined:

[Message 1] Maya: ""Anyone know why the Convention Center is closed?""
[Message 2] Chloe: ""No clue. Traffic was a nightmare this morning, though.""
[Message 3] Liam: ""Heard there was some kinda incident.""
[Message 4] Maya: ""Incident? Like what?""
[Message 5] Chloe: ""Probably just a burst pipe or something.""
[Message 6] Liam: ""Nah, my cousin works security nearby. Said it was serious.""
[Message 7] Maya: ""Serious how?""
[Message 8] Liam: ""He wouldn't say. But he mentioned 'evidence.'""
[Message 9] Chloe: ""Evidence of what? Bad catering?""
[Message 10] Maya: ""Chloe, you're impossible. Someone probably just tripped and fell.""
[Message 11] Liam: ""Heard someone say that 7.  Activist named Anya and the night guard...River were found dead. ""
[Message 12] Chloe: ""WHAT?! Anya and River? Seriously? ""
[Message 13] Maya: ""Oh my god, that's terrible!""
[Message 14] Liam: ""Yeah, pretty messed up. ""
[Message 15] Chloe: ""I knew Anya from the protests. She was...intense.""
[Message 16] Maya: ""Intense but harmless. River was just trying to make a living.""
[Message 17] Liam: ""My cousin mentioned something about a golf club.""
[Message 18] Chloe: ""A golf club? That's random.""
[Message 19] Maya: ""Maybe someone was playing golf inside? Stupid, but...""
[Message 20] Liam: ""Doubt it. He was being super vague.""
[Message 21] Chloe: ""I saw Anya arguing with someone a few days ago outside City Hall. Looked heated.""
[Message 22] Maya: ""Who was she arguing with?""
[Message 23] Chloe: ""Couldn't see. Just some woman.""
[Message 24] Liam: ""Maybe that woman had a motive. Anya ruffled a lot of feathers.""
[Message 25] Maya: ""Yeah, especially with that developer she kept protesting.""
[Message 26] Chloe: ""True. She was relentless.""
[Message 27] Liam: ""Did either of you know River well?""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Just in passing. Seemed like a good kid.""
[Message 29] Chloe: ""Same. Always sketching in their notebook.""
[Message 30] Liam: ""Okay, just curious.""
[Message 31] Maya: ""So, what now? Police investigation, right?""
[Message 32] Chloe: ""Obviously. This is a huge deal.""
[Message 33] Liam: ""Hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 34] Maya: ""Me too. It's horrifying.""
[Message 35] Chloe: ""Guys, I gotta run. Grocery shopping.""
[Message 36] Liam: ""Alright, see ya.""
[Message 37] Maya: ""Later.""
[Message 38] Chloe: ""Hey, Maya, before I go - do you remember seeing anything weird around the convention center lately?""
[Message 39] Maya: ""Weird how?""
[Message 40] Chloe: ""Like... anyone acting suspicious. Or just out of place?""
[Message 41] Maya: ""Not really. Why?""
[Message 42] Chloe: ""Just a feeling. Never mind. Bye.""
[Message 43] Maya: ""Okay... bye.""
[Message 44] Liam: ""That was a weird question from Chloe.""
[Message 45] Maya: ""Tell me about it. Makes you wonder.""
[Message 46] Liam: ""Wonder what?""
[Message 47] Maya: ""I don't know... if she knows something she's not saying.""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Could be. She knew Anya better than we did.""
[Message 49] Maya: ""True. And that argument she mentioned...""
[Message 50] Liam: ""Yeah. Maybe she saw who Anya was arguing with.""
[Message 51] Maya: ""We should probably just let the police handle it.""
[Message 52] Liam: ""Probably. But something feels off.""
[Message 53] Maya: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Just... the golf club thing. It's so specific.""
[Message 55] Maya: ""Maybe it was a crime of passion? Someone snapped?""
[Message 56] Liam: ""Maybe. Or someone intended this all along.""
[Message 57] Chloe: ""Back from the store. Ugh, so many people out today.""
[Message 58] Maya: ""Hey, Chloe. You okay?""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""Yeah, why wouldn't I be?""
[Message 60] Liam: ""You seemed a little on edge earlier.""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""Just stressed. This whole thing is awful.""
[Message 62] Maya: ""Did you remember who Anya was arguing with?""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""No, like I said, I couldn't see their face.""
[Message 64] Liam: ""Did you see what they were wearing, any details?""
[Message 65] Chloe: ""Just a dark coat. It was getting dark out.""
[Message 66] Maya: ""Anything else?""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""No, that's it. I had to catch the bus.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""Okay.""
[Message 69] Maya: ""Alright.""
[Message 70] Chloe: ""I'm making lasagna, anyone want to come over later?""
[Message 71] Maya: ""Sounds good, maybe.""
[Message 72] Liam: ""I'm in.""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Great! 7 pm?""
[Message 74] Maya: ""Perfect.""
[Message 75] Liam: ""See you then.""
[Message 76] Maya: ""Liam, you still there?""
[Message 77] Liam: ""Yep.""
[Message 78] Maya: ""Something is REALLY bugging me about Chloe.""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Yeah, me too. She's acting weird.""
[Message 80] Maya: ""The way she asked about seeing anything strange...""
[Message 81] Liam: ""And how she conveniently couldn't see the person Anya was arguing with.""
[Message 82] Maya: ""Exactly! It's like she's hiding something.""
[Message 83] Liam: ""Or trying to lead us in the wrong direction.""
[Message 84] Maya: ""Maybe she was buying Hitting with a golf club at the store and wanted to see if we suspect anything?""
[Message 85] Liam: ""That’s a reach, but I will keep it in mind, since that's the murder weapon.""
[Message 86] Maya: ""We should subtly try to find out more tonight.""
[Message 87] Liam: ""Agreed. Play it cool, though.""
[Message 88] Maya: ""Definitely. Don't want to spook her if she is innocent.""
[Message 89] Liam: ""Right. See you at Chloe's.""
[Message 90] Maya: ""See ya.""
[Message 91] Chloe: ""Hey, I'm just putting the lasagna in the oven. Should be ready around 7:15!""
[Message 92] Liam: ""Sounds delicious!""
[Message 93] Maya: ""Can't wait!""
[Message 94] Chloe: ""Oh, and I almost forgot - I found this old golf club in my garage. Anyone want it? I'm just going to donate it.""
[Message 95] Maya: ""A golf club? That's... interesting timing.""
[Message 96] Liam: ""Yeah, a little strange, Chloe.""
[Message 97] Chloe: ""What do you mean? It's just been sitting there for ages. I’m trying to declutter.""
[Message 98] Maya: ""No reason. Just... you know, with everything that happened.""
[Message 99] Chloe: ""Okay... well, let me know if you want it before I take it to Goodwill.""

[Message 103] Maya: ""Good luck. Be careful.""
[Message 104] Liam: ""Always am.""
[Message 105] Chloe: ""Liam, almost here! I saw him leave the building at Midnight last night.""
[Message 106] Liam: ""Just parked. Be right up.""
[Message 107] Chloe: ""Great! Oh, and I forgot to mention – I saw some of Anya’s activist friends outside River’s apartment last week. They looked angry.""
[Message 108] Liam: ""Interesting... see you in a sec.""
[Message 109] Maya: ""Okay, I'm officially freaked out. Both of them are acting sus.""
[Message 110] Maya: ""Liam, any updates? Is everything okay?""
[Message 111] Liam: ""Lasagna's good. Conversation... tense.""
[Message 112] Maya: ""Tense how?""
[Message 113] Liam: ""Chloe keeps bringing up Anya's enemies. But seems like she's acting like she has something to hide. Maybe she saw Anya arguing with someone? Or that Anya ruffled a lot of feathers and she was one of them.""
[Message 114] Maya: ""And the golf club? What did you say?""
[Message 115] Liam: ""Just played it cool. Said we'd think about it.""
[Message 116] Maya: ""Good. Keep me posted.""
[Message 117] Liam: ""Will do.""
[Message 118] Chloe: ""Hey Maya, Liam is in the restroom. It's just you and I. Was wondering your thoughts, cause I know how close you were to Anya and River.""
[Message 119] Maya: ""Close? I knew them, but not *close* close. What's up?""
[Message 120] Chloe: ""Well, the whole thing is just so crazy. River always sketched in their notebook. It's just... a terrible thing for any of us to experience, let alone them.""
[Message 121] Maya: ""Yeah, awful.""
[Message 122] Chloe: ""You don't think Liam could be involved, do you? He's always been a bit...off.""
[Message 123] Maya: ""Liam? No way. He's just awkward. Why would you think that?""
[Message 124] Chloe: ""I don't know... He's been asking a lot of questions. And he knew Anya ruffled a lot of feathers before they got there.""

[Message 2] Maya: ""Yeah, it's all over the news. Awful. Poor Mr. Davies.""
[Message 3] Chloe: ""Davies? The bartender? What happened?""
[Message 4] Liam: ""Murdered. Hammer. Brutal.""
[Message 5] Chloe: ""Oh my god! That's terrible. I was just talking to him yesterday about a new cocktail recipe. He seemed so anxious about something.""
[Message 6] Maya: ""Anxious? Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have. Actus Reus, someone wanted him silenced""
[Message 7] Kai: ""Seriously? A hammer? Who does that? Anyone know any details?""
[Message 8] Liam: ""Police are saying they have suspects. Kai, weren't you arguing with Davies last week about the inheritance? Mens Rea?""
[Message 9] Kai: ""Argument? Disagreement. Big difference, Liam. It was about the drink prices at the bar. Besides, I was at the gym Afternoon, ask Marco.""
[Message 10] Maya: ""Gym at that time? Sounds like a good alibi. Chloe, were you at the Community Center at all yesterday?""
[Message 11] Chloe: ""No, I was at home all day working on my pottery. I only saw Davies the day before. Honestly, I'm freaked out. This city is getting scary.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""They're reviewing security footage. I bet they know exactly who was there.""
[Message 13] Kai: ""Good. Catch the psycho. I heard the guy's face was unrecognizable. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 14] Maya: ""Unrecognizable? That's…a lot. Did you know Davies well, Kai?""
[Message 15] Kai: ""I knew him. Served me drinks. That's it. Why are you grilling me?""
[Message 16] Chloe: ""Maybe he knew too much. Remember when Davies mentioned that he saw someone messing with the Community Center's accounts?""
[Message 17] Liam: ""Chloe, you’re saying Davies suspected someone of embezzlement? Concurrence, someone’s actions led to his death.""
[Message 18] Chloe: ""I don't know embezzlement exactly, but something about finances being off. He was supposed to tell the manager.""
[Message 19] Maya: ""The manager! I almost forgot about her. Is she okay? Has anyone talked to her?""
[Message 20] Liam: ""I haven't heard. Maybe she's a suspect too. She had motive if Davies was going to rat someone out.""
[Message 21] Kai: ""This is all speculation. Let the police do their job. It could have been a robbery gone wrong. Attendant Circumstances?""
[Message 22] Chloe: ""True, but it seems personal, not random. A hammer... Ugh.""
[Message 23] Maya: ""Liam, you seemed pretty quick to point fingers at Kai. Anything you want to share?""
[Message 24] Liam: ""Just saying what everyone else is thinking. He wasn't exactly Davies' biggest fan after that drink price argument.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""I’m done with this. Marco vouched for me. You guys are acting like I’m the only one who ever disliked the guy.""
[Message 26] Chloe: ""Davies was kind of a jerk sometimes. Remember when he cut off drinks to that old lady last month? I felt bad for her.""
[Message 27] Maya: ""He could be rude, yeah. It was probably about protecting himself. Maybe he knew he was in danger.""
[Message 28] Liam: ""What if the manager and Davies were in cahoots about something and it went wrong? Causation, failing to protect him led to his death.""
[Message 29] Kai: ""Seriously, Liam? You're grasping at straws. Maybe the guy had a gambling problem.""

[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, it's awful. So sad about Casey.

[Message 3] Chloe: Unbelievable. I can't believe it. How did it even happen?

[Message 4] Noah: Apparently a car accident. Pretty messed up.

[Message 5] Olivia: Oh my god, that's terrible. Casey was always so nice to me when I visited.

[Message 6] Liam: Yeah, she was a good bartender. Always quick with a joke.

[Message 7] Maya: I saw her buying something at the store Dusk just before it happened. Is it a coincidence?

[Message 8] Chloe: Seriously? That's freaky, Maya.

[Message 9] Noah: Freaky indeed. I was supposed to meet Casey there that night, but I bailed last minute.

[Message 10] Olivia: Wow, Noah, you dodged a bullet.

[Message 11] Liam: Anyone know anything more about what happened? The news is vague.

[Message 12] Maya: Just that it was a hit and run. Cops are looking for the driver.

[Message 13] Chloe: Hope they catch the scum. I am so angry!

[Message 14] Noah: Me too, Chloe. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 15] Olivia: It makes me sick to my stomach.

[Message 16] Liam: Alright, alright, let's not dwell on it too much. What are we all doing tonight? Need a distraction.

[Message 17] Maya: I'm thinking of just staying in. This whole thing has me rattled.

[Message 18] Chloe: Same. Maybe a movie night?

[Message 19] Noah: Count me in for a movie. Pizza too?

[Message 20] Olivia: I'm in! Pizza sounds amazing.

[Message 21] Liam: Perfect. My place, 7 PM?

[Message 22] Maya: Sounds good. See you all then.

[Message 23] Chloe: See ya.

[Message 24] Noah: Later.

[Message 25] Olivia: Bye!

[Message 26] Liam: Hey Maya, you doing okay? You seemed extra shaken up.

[Message 27] Maya: Yeah, just… it's hitting me hard. I knew Casey. It feels too close to home. I was thinking of calling 911 after the accident but my phone died on me.

[Message 28] Liam: I get it. It's rough. Just remember we're all here for you.

[Message 29] Maya: Thanks, Liam. I appreciate that.

[Message 30] Chloe: Noah, you alright? You were supposed to be there...

[Message 31] Noah: Honestly, Chloe, I'm a mess. Keep thinking about what if. What if I went and could have helped?

[Message 32] Chloe: Don't beat yourself up, Noah. It's not your fault.

[Message 33] Noah: Easy for you to say. I saw David leave the building at Dusk and never return.

[Message 34] Chloe: David? What was he doing there?

[Message 35] Noah: He said he was picking up a friend, but he looked really agitated.

[Message 36] Chloe: That's weird. David's always seemed so calm.

[Message 37] Liam: David? You sure? He was with me all night working on that project.

[Message 38] Maya: Yeah, I saw you guys at the library until late.

[Message 39] Chloe: So Noah's mistaken?

[Message 40] Noah: I swear it was him. Maybe it was just someone who looked like him.

[Message 41] Olivia: This is all so confusing.

[Message 42] Liam: Let's just focus on the movie tonight, guys. We can talk about this later.

[Message 43] Maya: Agreed.

[Message 44] Chloe: Okay.

[Message 45] Noah: Fine.

[Message 46] Olivia: See you all soon.

[Message 47] Liam to Maya (Private): Hey, can you come over a little earlier? Want to talk.

[Message 48] Maya to Liam (Private): Sure, what's up?

[Message 49] Liam to Maya (Private): Just… I need to vent. This David thing has me freaked out.

[Message 50] Maya to Liam (Private): I'll be there around 6:30.

[Message 51] Chloe to Olivia (Private): Something's fishy. Noah's acting weird.

[Message 52] Olivia to Chloe (Private): Yeah, and the David thing doesn't add up.

[Message 53] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I have a bad feeling about this whole thing.

[Message 54] Olivia to Chloe (Private): Me too. Should we say something to the police?

[Message 55] Chloe to Olivia (Private): Let's wait and see what happens tonight.

[Message 56] Noah to Chloe (Private): Hey, about what I said about David… maybe I was wrong. It was dark.

[Message 57] Chloe to Noah (Private): Why are you changing your story?

[Message 58] Noah to Chloe (Private): I don't know. Just… forget I said anything.

[Message 59] Chloe to Noah (Private): Now I'm really worried.

[Message 60] Noah to Chloe (Private): Don't be. Just… drop it.

[Message 61] Liam: Pizza's ordered!

[Message 62] Maya: Great!

[Message 63] Chloe: Awesome.

[Message 64] Noah: Cool.

[Message 65] Olivia: Can't wait!

[Message 66] Liam to Maya (Private): Hey, can you bring the board games?

[Message 67] Maya to Liam (Private): Sure thing.

[Message 68] Chloe to Olivia (Private): Did you see that? Liam's being so normal.

[Message 69] Olivia to Chloe (Private): Too normal. It's creeping me out.

[Message 70] Noah to Chloe (Private): I think I should leave town.

[Message 71] Chloe to Noah (Private): What? Why?

[Message 72] Noah to Chloe (Private): I just… I don't feel safe here anymore.

[Message 73] Chloe to Noah (Private): Noah, you need to tell me what's going on.

[Message 74] Noah to Chloe (Private): I can't. Just… trust me.

[Message 75] Chloe to Noah (Private): I don't know if I can, Noah.

[Message 76] Olivia to Chloe (Private): He's definitely involved somehow.

[Message 77] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I think so too.

[Message 78] Liam: Almost there!

[Message 79] Maya: On my way!

[Message 80] Chloe: Leaving now.

[Message 81] Noah: Be there soon.

[Message 82] Olivia: Heading out!

[Message 83] Liam to Maya (Private): So glad you're coming early.

[Message 84] Maya to Liam (Private): Me too. I need to talk to someone.

[Message 85] Liam to Maya (Private): I'm here.

[Message 86] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I'm calling the police after the movie.

[Message 87] Olivia to Chloe (Private): Good. This has gone too far.

[Message 88] Noah to Chloe (Private): I knew that Casey always hated David.

[Message 89] Chloe to Noah (Private): What does David have to do with this, Noah?

[Message 90] Noah to Chloe (Private): Just...be careful, Chloe.

[Message 91] Chloe to Olivia (Private): Did Noah say something to you about David?

[Message 92] Olivia to Chloe (Private): No, why?

[Message 93] Chloe to Olivia (Private): He just texted me something really cryptic about David.

[Message 94] Olivia to Chloe (Private): This is escalating quickly.

[Message 95] Liam: Movie time!

[Message 96] Maya: Popcorn's ready!

[Message 97] Chloe: Let's get this over with.

[Message 98] Noah: Okay.

[Message 99] Olivia: Finally.

[Message 100] Liam to Maya (Private): So, what's bothering you?

[Message 101] Maya to Liam (Private): I keep thinking about what happened to Casey. Did she knew that she wanted to get rid of David?

[Message 102] Liam to Maya (Private): Who knows? People say all sorts of things.

[Message 103] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I think Noah intended to hurt someone that night.

[Message 104] Olivia to Chloe (Private): I agree. His behavior is unsettling.

[Message 105] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I feel like we're sitting on a powder keg.

[Message 106] Olivia to Chloe (Private): We need to be careful.

[Message 107] Noah to Chloe (Private): I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

[Message 108] Chloe to Noah (Private): What did you do, Noah?

[Message 109] Noah to Chloe (Private): I can't tell you. It's too dangerous.

[Message 110] Chloe to Olivia (Private): He's admitting to something!

[Message 111] Olivia to Chloe (Private): Call the police now!

[Message 112] Chloe to Olivia (Private): On it!

[Message 113] Liam: Okay, movie's done. Anyone want to play a game?

[Message 114] Maya: Sure, let's do it.

[Message 115] Noah: Maybe later. I'm not feeling so good.

[Message 116] Olivia: We should probably head out anyway.

[Message 117] Chloe: Yeah, I'm tired too.

[Message 120] Chloe: Thanks.

[Message 125] Liam to Maya (Private): Well, thanks for coming early. I appreciate it.

[Message 126] Maya to Liam (Private): Anytime. I'm here for you too.

[Message 127] Olivia to Chloe (Private): The police are on their way.

[Message 130] Chloe to Noah (Private): You WHAT?!?!

[Message 131] Noah to Chloe (Private): I tried to talk him out of it.

[Message 132] Chloe to Noah (Private): You need to turn yourself in, Noah.

[Message 133] Noah to Chloe (Private): I can't. They'll never believe me.

[Message 134] Chloe to Olivia (Private): He admitted to planning something!

[Message 135] Olivia to Chloe (Private): The police are almost here! Stay calm!

[Message 136] Chloe to Olivia (Private): I'm trying!

[Message 137] Liam: What was that scream?

[Message 138] Maya: Sounded like it came from outside.

[Message 139] Chloe: The police are here.

[Message 151] Police: Noah, you're under arrest.

[Message 152] Noah: I didn't do anything!

[Message 153] Chloe: Yes, you did, Noah.

[Message 154] Olivia: It's over.

[Message 155] Liam: I'm so confused.

[Message 4] Ben: ""Hmm, good point. Maybe the one with the crabs on it? Kidding! Probably the navy blue one.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Navy sounds perfect! I'm rocking my usual - a comfy sweater. Fashion is about comfort, right?""

[Message 7] Alex: ""Fascinating! So, are we talking about the evolution of Baltimore street style, or…?""
[Message 8] Ben: ""Haha, nah. More like the psychology of fashion and first impressions. Less location-specific, more universal.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Gotcha. Speaking of universal, did you see that abstract sculpture at the museum last week? So cool!""
[Message 10] Ben: ""No, I missed it! Was it the new exhibit? I've been meaning to go. We should go together sometime!""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Definitely! After this presentation, maybe? Anyway, back to fashion... what's your take on the whole 'dad shoe' trend?""
[Message 12] Ben: ""Honestly? I'm a fan. Comfort AND ironic style? Win-win! Though my daughter thinks I’m actually just wearing *my* dad shoes.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Haha! Maybe she's got a point. I'm more of a minimalist sneaker person myself. Less… statement-y.""
[Message 14] Ben: ""Fair enough. Simplicity is a statement in itself, sometimes. You know, for someone who claims fashion is about comfort, you’ve got great taste.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Thanks, Ben! You too. So, after this presentation, coffee, sculpture, maybe a nap? Dawn is rough.""
[Message 16] Ben: ""Sounds like a plan! Oh, I just remembered, I need to pick up some dry cleaning later. Super glamorous, I know.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""The height of fashion! Does it involve sequins? Asking for a friend. That friend is me.""
[Message 18] Ben: ""Sadly, no sequins. Just some boring dress shirts. Though maybe I should ask them to add some…""

[Message 39] Maya: ""Absolutely! The flavor is unmatched. So, anyone else want a lemon bar?""

144,"[Message 1] Alex: Filling up the tank. Sunset is looking amazing tonight! Anyone else around Cleveland?
[Message 2] Jamie: Just finished work, heading home. That sunset is pretty spectacular though.
[Message 3] Sam: I am! Just grabbed a coffee near University Circle. What's up?
[Message 4] Alex: Just thinking about presentation prep. Got one coming up on municipal bonds. Ugh.
[Message 5] Jamie: Oh, presentations. As a teacher, I live and breathe them. Any tips?
[Message 6] Sam: I have a presentation next week too! Mine's on the history of the Great Lakes.
[Message 7] Alex: Tips? Practice, practice, practice. And know your audience. 80 years ""#"" + str(int(0)) years old and they're probably going to want different info than 20 years ""#"" + str(int(0)) years olds.
[Message 8] Jamie: Good point, Alex. Knowing your audience is key. Are you going to use visuals?
[Message 9] Sam: Visuals are a must! I'm thinking maps and old photos for mine.
[Message 10] Alex: Thinking some charts and graphs. And maybe a few anecdotes to keep it interesting.
[Message 11] Jamie: Anecdotes are great! Makes it more relatable. Remember that time I presented about the importance of financial literacy to a group of high schoolers?
[Message 12] Sam: Oh, do tell!
[Message 13] Jamie: They were totally disinterested until I framed it as ""how to become a millionaire before you're 30."" Suddenly, all ears.
[Message 14] Alex: Hah! Smart thinking. Money talks.
[Message 15] Sam: Definitely. Speaking of money, anyone thinking about the market volatility lately?
[Message 16] Alex: Always. That's my bread and butter. 80 years ""#"" + str(int(0)) years old, seen it all.
[Message 17] Jamie: I dabble in investing, but I'm much more cautious. Teacher salary, you know? 55 years ""#"" + str(int(0)) years old.
[Message 18] Sam: Understandable. 42 years ""#"" + str(int(0)) years old, I'm a bit more impulsive. Still learning the ropes.
[Message 19] Alex: Impulsive? In investing? Be careful!
[Message 20] Sam: I know, I know. I'm working on it. Maybe I should take your municipal bond presentation as a sign to be more conservative.
[Message 21] Jamie: Good idea, Sam. Start slow and steady.
[Message 22] Alex: Exactly. Diversification is your friend.
[Message 23] Sam: Okay, okay, noted. Back to presentations, any tips for dealing with stage fright?
[Message 24] Jamie: Deep breaths. Visualize success. And remember, they're probably just as nervous as you are (or at least, willing you to succeed).
[Message 25] Alex: I second the deep breaths. And focus on your message, not yourself.
[Message 26] Sam: Good advice. I tend to ramble when I get nervous.
[Message 27] Jamie: Practice in front of a mirror, or even better, a friend. Get feedback.
[Message 28] Alex: Record yourself. It's painful, but helpful.
[Message 29] Sam: Ugh, recording myself. The worst.
[Message 30] Jamie: I know, but it works!
[Message 31] Alex: And don't be afraid to pause. Silence is okay.
[Message 32] Sam: Good point. I always feel like I need to fill every second.
[Message 33] Jamie: Me too! It's a common mistake.
[Message 34] Alex: So, back to the Great Lakes presentation, Sam. What's the most interesting thing you've learned?
[Message 35] Sam: Oh man, so much. Probably the history of the Cuyahoga River catching fire.
[Message 36] Jamie: Oh yeah, that's a classic Cleveland story.
[Message 37] Alex: A little embarrassing, but important to remember.
[Message 38] Sam: Exactly. Shows how far we've come.
[Message 39] Jamie: Definitely. Progress is possible.
[Message 40] Alex: And what about you, Jamie? Anything exciting happening in the teaching world?
[Message 41] Jamie: Trying to get the kids interested in personal finance. It's an uphill battle.
[Message 42] Sam: I can imagine. So many distractions.
[Message 43] Alex: Maybe bring in some guest speakers? Local financial advisors?
[Message 44] Jamie: That's a good idea. I'll look into that.
[Message 45] Sam: Or maybe a field trip to a bank?
[Message 46] Alex: Even better, to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland!
[Message 47] Jamie: Now you're talking! I'll see what I can arrange.
[Message 48] Sam: Let me know if you need any help. I'm always up for a field trip.
[Message 49] Alex: Me too! Even though I'm ""retired.""
[Message 50] Jamie: Retirement doesn't mean you stop learning or helping out.
[Message 51] Sam: Exactly. It just means you have more time for it.
[Message 52] Alex: True that. So, Sam, besides the Cuyahoga, what's another fun fact about the Great Lakes?
[Message 53] Sam: Hmmm... that they hold 21% of the world's surface freshwater.
[Message 54] Jamie: Wow, that's a lot.
[Message 55] Alex: Impressive. Makes you appreciate them even more.
[Message 56] Sam: Definitely. Gotta protect them.
[Message 57] Jamie: Absolutely. Future generations depend on it.
[Message 58] Alex: Speaking of future generations, how are your kids doing, Jamie?
[Message 59] Jamie: They're good! One's in college, the other's starting to look at schools. Stressful time.
[Message 60] Sam: Oh, the college application process. I remember that.
[Message 61] Alex: A whole different world these days, I imagine.
[Message 62] Jamie: It is. So much competition.
[Message 63] Sam: Any idea what they want to study?
[Message 64] Jamie: One's thinking about engineering, the other's interested in art.
[Message 65] Alex: Good range of interests!
[Message 66] Sam: Definitely. Keeps things interesting.
[Message 67] Jamie: It does. So, Alex, what's the best piece of financial advice you've ever received?
[Message 68] Alex: Start saving early. Even if it's just a little bit.
[Message 69] Sam: Makes sense. Compound interest is a powerful thing.
[Message 70] Jamie: Absolutely. Time is your biggest asset.
[Message 71] Alex: Exactly. The earlier you start, the better.
[Message 72] Sam: I wish I'd known that when I was younger.
[Message 73] Jamie: We all do. But it's never too late to start.
[Message 74] Alex: True. And don't be afraid to ask for help.
[Message 75] Sam: Good point. There are plenty of resources available.
[Message 76] Jamie: Financial advisors, online courses, books...
[Message 77] Alex: And don't fall for scams. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
[Message 78] Sam: Definitely. Common sense goes a long way.
[Message 79] Jamie: Agreed. So, anyone doing anything fun this weekend?
[Message 80] Alex: Thinking about hitting up the art museum.
[Message 81] Sam: Oh, that sounds nice. I might go fishing if the weather's good.
[Message 82] Jamie: I'll probably just relax at home with a good book.
[Message 83] Alex: Sounds lovely. What are you reading?
[Message 84] Jamie: A biography of Eleanor Roosevelt. Fascinating woman.
[Message 85] Sam: Nice! I'm reading a thriller right now.
[Message 86] Alex: Ooh, what's the title?
[Message 87] Sam: ""The Silent Patient."" Highly recommend.
[Message 88] Jamie: I'll add it to my list.
[Message 89] Alex: Me too. Always looking for a good read.
[Message 90] Sam: Well, I should probably head out. Gotta get some rest before my presentation.
[Message 91] Jamie: Good luck, Sam! You'll do great.
[Message 92] Alex: Break a leg!
[Message 93] Sam: Thanks, guys! Appreciate it.
[Message 94] Jamie: No problem. Have a good night!
[Message 95] Alex: You too! Drive safe.
[Message 96] Sam: Will do. Talk to you later!
[Message 97] Jamie: Bye!
[Message 98] Alex: So, Jamie, still thinking about that field trip to the Fed?
[Message 99] Jamie: Definitely. I'm going to email them tomorrow.
[Message 100] Alex: Let me know if you need any connections. I know a few people there.
[Message 101] Jamie: That would be amazing, Alex! Thank you!
[Message 102] Alex: No problem at all. Happy to help.
[Message 103] Jamie: Well, I should probably get going too. Dinner time.
[Message 104] Alex: Alright. Enjoy your evening!

[Message 2] Jordan: Heard what? Spill!
[Message 3] Casey: Yeah, I'm out of the loop.
[Message 4] Riley: Two people are dead! It was Arson by setting a fire at Night, apparently.
[Message 5] Jordan: What?! That's insane! Who were they?
[Message 6] Casey: Oh god, that's awful. Playground is so close to me.
[Message 7] Riley: It was Delia and Marco.
[Message 8] Jordan: Delia?! No way! I knew her. She was always so kind. What about Marco?
[Message 9] Casey: Marco...wasn't he the security guard there? He let me in once when I forgot my ID.
[Message 10] Riley: Yeah, the Security Guard. And Delia, the Taxi Driver. This is so messed up.
[Message 11] Jordan: Did they say how it happened? Any suspects?
[Message 12] Casey: I heard whispers about it being an accident. A faulty electrical wire, maybe?
[Message 13] Riley: Accident my ass. Someone purposefully did this. I overheard Vinny saying he always hated Delia.
[Message 14] Jordan: Vinny? Seriously? He seemed like such a chill dude.
[Message 15] Casey: Vinny has been acting weird. He was buying Arson by setting a fire at the store on Monday.
[Message 16] Riley: See! I knew it!
[Message 17] Jordan: Hold on, buying Arson by setting a fire doesn't automatically make him a killer. Maybe he was just messing around. Hope they don't get the death penalty for this.
[Message 18] Casey: True, but I also heard him arguing with Delia last week about something...sounded intense.
[Message 19] Riley: About what? We need to tell the cops everything we know.
[Message 20] Jordan: Whoa, easy there, Riley. Let's not jump to conclusions. What if we're wrong?
[Message 21] Casey: I don't know the details, but I remember him saying something like ""I intend to make you pay"" to Delia before he left.
[Message 22] Riley: That's it! That's Mens Rea right there! He intended it! The guy's a psycho!
[Message 23] Jordan: Okay, okay, but let's not forget about Alex. They were always complaining about Marco being a business competitor.
[Message 24] Casey: Alex? With the gold tooth? Really?
[Message 25] Riley: I don't buy it. Alex is all talk. Vinny is another story.
[Message 26] Jordan: I just heard from someone that Alex was looking up how to make Arson by setting a fire online last month.
[Message 27] Casey: What?! That's even worse than Vinny!
[Message 28] Riley: You two are acting like you're Sherlock Holmes all of a sudden. Maybe we should focus on something else... Did you see that sale at the mall?
[Message 29] Jordan: Riley, this is serious! Two people are dead! The victims’ lives mattered. How can you think about shopping right now?
[Message 30] Casey: Yeah, Riley, that's kinda insensitive. Even though Vinny was talking about hurting Delia right before he went over there, I can't say for sure he did anything. He's never been violent before.
[Message 31] Riley: Fine, fine. But don't come crying to me when it turns out to be Vinny and you guys were too busy defending him. I just have a feeling.
[Message 32] Jordan: A feeling isn't evidence, Riley. Remember that time you were convinced Mrs. Gable was a witch?
[Message 33] Casey: Let’s just give the police the information and let them sort it out. We could be wrong.
[Message 34] Riley: Whatever. I'm still convinced Vinny is involved. It's just...obvious.

[Message 4] Jordan: ""I know, but it's hard to ignore when it could impact our jobs, right?""

[Message 6] Jordan: ""Massive investment in roads, bridges, public transit... all that jazz.""

[Message 8] Jordan: ""Exactly. And that's where the political fight starts. How to pay for it?""

[Message 18] Jordan: ""I hope so. What are your thoughts on the current mayoral race? Any preferences?""

[Message 20] Jordan: ""Fair enough. I'm trying to stay informed, but it's all so polarized these days.""

[Message 29] Alex: ""Thanks, Jordan. I appreciate that. I will. Maybe I can buy you lunch with my signing bonus! Haha.""

[Message 32] Quinn: I got one too. I'm planning on it. Seems like it'll be fun.

[Message 34] Jamie: I understand. I'm mostly excited about the food!
[Message 35] Quinn: Haha, that's a good reason to go! I heard they're having a really good caterer.
[Message 36] Elias: Okay, you guys are tempting me. Food *is* a good incentive.

[Message 41] Quinn: Excellent! It'll be great to see you there, Elias.
[Message 42] Elias: So, back to complaints... any tips for dealing with unreasonable clients?
[Message 43] Jamie: Patience is key. And a healthy dose of humor.
[Message 44] Quinn: Definitely patience. And I try to explain things in simple terms, even if it feels like I'm repeating myself.
[Message 45] Elias: Good point, Quinn. Sometimes they just need to hear it a different way.
[Message 46] Jamie: Exactly. Also, documentation is your friend!
[Message 47] Quinn: Oh yeah, always document everything!
[Message 48] Elias: Absolutely. CYA (cover your assets), as they say.
[Message 49] Jamie: Precisely! Learned that the hard way once.
[Message 50] Quinn: We all have, I think. Rookie mistake.
[Message 51] Elias: Anyone ever get a complaint that was actually valid? Like, *they* were right, and *you* messed up?
[Message 52] Jamie: Of course! We're all human. Humility goes a long way.
[Message 53] Quinn: Yeah, I admitted fault once. It was tough, but the client actually appreciated my honesty.
[Message 54] Elias: Good for you, Quinn. That takes guts.
[Message 55] Jamie: Totally agree. Admitting mistakes builds trust.
[Message 56] Elias: True. Alright, I think I'm gonna call it a night. My brain is officially fried.
[Message 57] Jamie: Same here! Goodnight, everyone.
[Message 58] Quinn: Goodnight! See you tomorrow morning.
[Message 59] Elias: Sleep well!
[Message 60] Jamie: You too!
[Message 61] Quinn: Don't let the tax laws bite!
[Message 62] Elias: Haha, I'll try my best.
[Message 63] Jamie: Sweet dreams!
[Message 64] Elias: Morning, guys! Ready for coffee?
[Message 65] Jamie: Morning! Absolutely. Needed this more than ever.
[Message 66] Quinn: Morning! Yep, feeling the caffeine withdrawal already.
[Message 67] Elias: Haha, me too. The daily grind, indeed.
[Message 68] Jamie: Pun intended?
[Message 69] Elias: Of course!
[Message 70] Quinn: So, anyone have any particularly awful client stories to share this morning?
[Message 71] Jamie: Oh, I have one from yesterday. This woman insisted I miscalculated her deduction, but she was using an outdated form.
[Message 72] Elias: Oh lord. Classic.
[Message 73] Quinn: Happened to me last week! They printed something from 2018.
[Message 74] Jamie: Exactly! I had to gently explain that things change.
[Message 75] Elias: It's like explaining the internet to your grandma.
[Message 76] Quinn: Perfect analogy, Elias!
[Message 77] Jamie: So true!
[Message 78] Elias: Has anyone had a client try to bribe them?
[Message 79] Jamie: Whoa, that's intense! No, thankfully.
[Message 80] Quinn: Never! I'd report them immediately.
[Message 81] Elias: Good. Just curious. I read about it happening sometimes.
[Message 82] Jamie: It probably does, but hopefully not in Corpus Christi!
[Message 83] Quinn: Let's hope not!
[Message 84] Elias: So, Sarah's wedding... what are you guys planning to wear?
[Message 85] Jamie: I'm thinking a nice flowy dress. Something comfortable.
[Message 86] Quinn: I'm going with a suit. Can't go wrong with a classic.
[Message 87] Elias: I haven't even thought about it yet. Maybe I'll raid my closet and see what I can find.
[Message 88] Jamie: Good plan! You have great style, Elias.
[Message 89] Quinn: Agreed. You always look put-together.
[Message 90] Elias: Thanks, guys! I try.
[Message 91] Jamie: Any new hiking trails you've been exploring, Quinn?
[Message 92] Quinn: Not lately, been too busy with work. But I'm planning a trip to Big Bend next month.
[Message 93] Elias: Oh, nice! I've always wanted to go there.
[Message 94] Jamie: Me too! It's on my bucket list.
[Message 95] Quinn: You should both come! We could make it a group trip.
[Message 96] Elias: That sounds amazing! I'd have to check my schedule.
[Message 97] Jamie: I'm definitely interested! Let me know the dates.
[Message 98] Quinn: Will do! I'll send you guys some info later.
[Message 99] Elias: Great! Thanks, Quinn.
[Message 100] Jamie: Awesome!
[Message 101] Quinn: Okay, gotta run. Client meeting in 10 minutes.
[Message 102] Elias: Good luck!
[Message 103] Jamie: Bye!
[Message 104] Elias: Anyone have any recommendations for lunch places near the office? I'm starving.
[Message 105] Jamie: I'm always a fan of Harrison's Landing.
[Message 106] Elias: Ooh, good call. Seafood sounds good.
[Message 107] Jamie: They have great shrimp tacos.
[Message 108] Elias: Sold!
[Message 109] Jamie: Enjoy!
[Message 110] Elias: Will do! Thanks for the suggestion.
[Message 111] Jamie: No problem! Back to the grind...
[Message 112] Elias: You too! Talk later.
[Message 113] Elias: That shrimp taco was amazing! Thanks again, Jamie.
[Message 114] Jamie: Glad you liked it!
[Message 115] Elias: Seriously, the best. I needed that.
[Message 116] Jamie: Always happy to share the culinary knowledge.
[Message 117] Elias: Speaking of sharing, has anyone seen my blue pen? I swear I just had it...
[Message 118] Jamie: Check under your keyboard?
[Message 119] Elias: Good idea!
[Message 120] Elias: Nope, not there.
[Message 121] Jamie: Hmm, maybe it rolled off your desk?
[Message 122] Elias: Possible. I'll do a thorough search later. It's my favorite pen!
[Message 123] Jamie: I hope you find it! Losing a good pen is the worst.
[Message 124] Elias: I know, right? Anyway, back to work... for real this time.
[Message 125] Jamie: Good luck with the pen hunt and the spreadsheets!",0,

150,"[Message 1] Kai: Hey, did you hear about what happened at the Food Bank?

[Message 2] Riley: Yeah, it's all over the news. Terrible about Judge Thompson.

[Message 3] Kai: I know, right? Makes you wonder who would do something like that.

[Message 4] Riley: Some sicko, probably. You working tonight?

[Message 5] Kai: Nah, got the night off. Thinking of hitting up that new pizza place. You in?

[Message 6] Riley: Can't, got a double shift. But tell me how it is!

[Message 7] Kai: Will do! Stay safe.

[Message 8] Jordan: Riley, you seen Mateo today? He's been acting weird.

[Message 9] Riley: Weird how?

[Message 10] Jordan: Just…distant. And he kept asking about Judge Thompson’s schedule last week.

[Message 11] Riley: Mateo? Really? He's always been respectful of the Judge.

[Message 12] Jordan: I know! That's why it's strange. Maybe I'm just paranoid.

[Message 13] Riley: Probably. Don't jump to conclusions.

[Message 14] Mateo: Jordan, you seen my ring anywhere? I swear I had it on this morning.

[Message 15] Jordan: No, sorry. Check the break room?

[Message 16] Mateo: Already did. It’s driving me crazy. That ring was a gift.

[Message 17] Riley: I'll keep an eye out. Losing something valuable sucks.

[Message 18] Mateo: Thanks, I appreciate it.

[Message 19] Kai: Did you see Judge Thompson had a heart attack? I heard he wasnt feeling well last week

[Message 20] Riley: Where'd you hear that? The news said it was Poisoning via ingestion.

[Message 21] Kai: Oh, weird. A friend told me. Guess they were wrong.

[Message 22] Riley: Yeah, pretty big difference between those two things.

[Message 23] Jordan: Mateo, did you find your ring?

[Message 24] Mateo: No, still missing. I'm starting to freak out.

[Message 25] Jordan: Maybe it’ll turn up. Try to relax.

[Message 26] Riley: You okay, Jordan? You seem stressed.

[Message 27] Jordan: Just… this whole thing with Judge Thompson is getting to me. And Mateo losing his ring on top of it.

[Message 28] Riley: It's understandable. It's a lot to process.

[Message 29] Mateo: I just remembered, I saw Judge Thompson at the Food Bank around midnight last night. He was alone.

[Message 30] Jordan: Midnight? What were you doing there?

[Message 31] Mateo: I couldn't sleep. Went for a walk.

[Message 32] Jordan: Weird coincidence.

[Message 33] Riley: Yeah, that is a bit strange, Mateo.

[Message 34] Mateo: What do you mean? I'm just saying what I saw.

[Message 35] Riley: Nothing, just… bad timing.

[Message 36] Jordan: Hey, Mateo, remember when you were saying the Judge was being unfair to your mom's case?

[Message 37] Mateo: That was ages ago! I was just venting. It had nothing to do with...this.

[Message 38] Riley: Venting is one thing, but I heard you say you wanted to cause him harm.

[Message 39] Mateo: I didn't intend for anything like this to happen. It was just words!

[Message 40] Jordan: I saw Kai buying something at the store that looked like Poisoning via ingestion yesterday. Thought it was weird.

[Message 41] Riley: Really? That's… concerning.

[Message 42] Kai: What? I was buying rat Poisoning via ingestion for my apartment! I have a huge problem with them.

[Message 43] Riley: Proof?

[Message 44] Kai: Look at my search history. I was looking up rat Poisoning via ingestion all week

[Message 45] Jordan: Still sus. Why would you buy it yesterday?

[Message 46] Kai: Because that’s when I had time to go to the store! Seriously, you guys are twisting things.

[Message 47] Riley: Okay, okay. Calm down, Kai.

[Message 48] Mateo: Jordan, that's a messed up thing to say, especially when someone just died.

[Message 49] Jordan: I'm just saying what I saw.

[Message 50] Riley: Everyone, let’s just take a breath. This is getting out of hand.

[Message 51] Kai: I'm going home. I can't deal with this right now.

[Message 52] Riley: Okay, Kai. We'll talk later.

[Message 53] Jordan: Someone has to pay for what happened to Judge Thompson. I hope they get the death penalty.

[Message 54] Mateo: That’s a bit harsh, isn’t it?

[Message 55] Jordan: Is it? A man is dead.

[Message 56] Riley: Look, can we all agree to just cooperate with the police? Let them figure this out.

[Message 57] Mateo: Agreed. I'm happy to answer any questions.

[Message 58] Jordan: Fine.

[Message 59] Kai: So, you all are turning against each other now?

[Message 60] Riley: It's not turning against each other, Kai. It's about finding the truth.

[Message 61] Kai: Easy for you to say. I’m the one being accused of buying Poisoning via ingestion.

[Message 62] Jordan: Maybe you should have thought about that before buying rat Poisoning via ingestion.

[Message 63] Mateo: Lay off, Jordan.

[Message 64] Riley: Guys! This isn't helping.

[Message 65] Kai: I'm done talking.

[Message 66] Riley: Fine. I'm going to try and get some sleep before my shift.

[Message 67] Jordan: Night.

[Message 68] Mateo: Goodnight, Riley.

[Message 69] Riley: Hey Mateo, found the Judge's file in the trash. I thought it was weird that Jordan was the last one to be seen with it.

[Message 70] Mateo: Do you know what was in the file?

[Message 71] Riley: No, all I know is it was his case notes. Seems kinda suspicious if she was acting to protect a loved one.

[Message 72] Mateo: I'll see what I can do to help.

[Message 73] Riley: Appreciate it. I don't want someone else getting hurt.

[Message 74] Mateo: Hey, I think I know who was responsible for what happened with Judge Thompson, but I will need your help

[Message 9] Jamie: Probably in the fall, when it's not too hot.
[Message 10] Jordan: Smart move. I went in July once. Never again. Melting is an understatement.
[Message 11] Quinn: I'm hoping to get away for a long weekend sometime soon. Maybe a camping trip if the weather cooperates.
[Message 12] Alex: Camping, Quinn? That sounds refreshing! I've been meaning to get back into that.
[Message 13] Quinn: It's great! Highly recommend. Nothing beats a campfire and some starry skies.
[Message 14] Riley: I’ve always wanted to try glamping! Seems like a good middle ground.
[Message 15] Jordan: Glamping? Is that glamorous camping? Sounds...expensive.
[Message 16] Riley: Haha, yeah, basically! A little more comfortable than roughing it.
[Message 17] Alex: Back to vacations, any other planned trips? Or even dream destinations?
[Message 18] Jamie: I'd love to see the Northern Lights someday. Iceland or Norway maybe.
[Message 19] Jordan: Now that's a worthy goal. I'm more of a beach person myself. Give me sun, sand, and a good book.
[Message 20] Quinn: A good book is essential no matter where you are!
[Message 21] Alex: Agreed! So true. Speaking of books, has anyone read anything good lately? Slightly off-topic, I know.
[Message 22] Riley: I just finished ""Project Hail Mary"" by Andy Weir. So good!
[Message 23] Jamie: Oh, I’ve heard good things about that! I’ll add it to my list. Thanks, Riley!
[Message 24] Jordan: I'm currently slogging through a biography of Teddy Roosevelt. Fascinating, but dense.
[Message 25] Quinn: I'm reading a collection of short stories by Ted Chiang. Mind-bending stuff.
[Message 26] Alex: Cool! Okay, back on track. So, regarding the vacation policy...
[Message 27] Riley: Are we adding any extra floating holidays this year? Fingers crossed!
[Message 28] Jamie: That would be amazing!
[Message 29] Jordan: More time off is always appreciated.
[Message 30] Quinn: Agreed. Work-life balance is so important.
[Message 31] Alex: We'll get into those details shortly. Just wanted to gauge everyone's general interest in vacation time, which I think is pretty obvious!
[Message 32] Jamie: Haha, yes, very obvious!
[Message 33] Riley: I feel personally attacked. (In a good way!)
[Message 34] Jordan: Guilty as charged!
[Message 35] Quinn: No shame here!
[Message 36] Alex: So, the main changes to the policy are around carry-over days...
[Message 37] Jamie: Carry-over days? Tell me more!
[Message 38] Riley: Yes, please elaborate!
[Message 39] Jordan: I always forget what the limit is.
[Message 40] Quinn: Same here.
[Message 41] Alex: We're increasing the number of days you can carry over into the new year.
[Message 42] Jamie: That's fantastic news!
[Message 43] Riley: This is a game changer!
[Message 44] Jordan: Excellent! No more scrambling to use them up in December.
[Message 45] Quinn: Definitely reduces the end-of-year stress.
[Message 46] Alex: Exactly! We heard your feedback about that.
[Message 47] Jamie: It's great to know our opinions are being heard.
[Message 48] Riley: Truly appreciated!
[Message 49] Jordan: Thank you!
[Message 50] Quinn: Makes a big difference.
[Message 51] Alex: You're welcome! Also, there's a slight tweak to the blackout dates around the holidays...
[Message 52] Jamie: Blackout dates? Oh no...
[Message 53] Riley: Hopefully, it's not too restrictive.
[Message 54] Jordan: Crossing my fingers...
[Message 55] Quinn: What are the details?
[Message 56] Alex: We've actually *reduced* the number of blackout days around Christmas and New Year's.

[Message 17] Ben: Yeah, a little. We talked sometimes. Why?
[Message 18] Liam: Just wondering.
[Message 19] Anya: Did they say anything strange lately?
[Message 20] Ben: Nope. Just usual stuff. Weather, sports...
[Message 21] Liam: Huh.
[Message 22] Anya: Liam, you seem suspicious of Ben.
[Message 23] Liam: I'm just trying to understand what happened, Anya. That’s all.
[Message 24] Ben: Understandable. This is wild.
[Message 25] Anya: True.
[Message 26] Liam: By the way, Ben, I saw you leaving the gym around Early Afternoon yesterday.
[Message 27] Ben: Yeah, I was there. Working out. What time was that exactly?
[Message 28] Liam: Around Early Afternoon. Did you see anything weird?
[Message 29] Ben: Nope. Just the usual crowd.
[Message 30] Anya: Did you see anyone near that top platform, where they fell from?
[Message 31] Ben: Can't say that I did. Was focusing on my sets.
[Message 32] Liam: Right.
[Message 33] Anya: I heard the police are really investigating.
[Message 34] Ben: Yeah, they should be. Catch the creep who did it.
[Message 35] Liam: Hope they don't get the death penalty.
[Message 36] Anya: Me too.
[Message 37] Ben: So, anyone want to grab pizza later?
[Message 38] Liam: Seriously, Ben?
[Message 39] Anya: Maybe later, Ben.
[Message 40] Ben: Okay, okay. Just thought I'd ask.
[Message 41] Liam: Okay.
[Message 42] Anya: This is just so awful, thinking about Dana and Alex...
[Message 43] Ben: Agreed. Tragic.
[Message 44] Liam: Did either of them mention having any enemies, Ben?
[Message 45] Ben: Not to me, no.
[Message 46] Anya: Okay.
[Message 47] Liam: You seem pretty calm, Ben.
[Message 48] Ben: What do you want me to do, Liam? Freak out? I'm dealing with it my way.
[Message 49] Anya: Maybe Liam is right. You are acting kinda strange.
[Message 50] Ben: Look, I'm just not as emotional as you two. Doesn't mean I'm a suspect!
[Message 51] Liam: I never said you were a suspect.
[Message 52] Ben: You heavily implied it.
[Message 53] Anya: Guys, stop. Arguing isn't going to help.
[Message 54] Liam: Fine.
[Message 55] Ben: Fine.
[Message 56] Anya: I'm gonna go help Dana's family if they need anything.
[Message 57] Liam: Good idea, Anya.
[Message 58] Ben: Let me know if they need anything.
[Message 59] Anya: I will.
[Message 60] Liam: I'm going to see if I can find any info from anyone else at the gym.
[Message 61] Ben: Alright. Be careful.
[Message 62] Anya: Okay guys, talk soon.
[Message 63] Liam: Later.
[Message 64] Ben: Later.
[Message 65] Liam: Hey, Anya, you still up?
[Message 66] Anya: Yeah, what's up, Liam?
[Message 67] Liam: I was thinking about what Ben said. He was acting weirdly calm.
[Message 68] Anya: I know.
[Message 69] Liam: And he was at the gym at Early Afternoon...
[Message 70] Anya: What if he knew something he isn't saying?
[Message 71] Liam: Exactly! He also mentioned he saw a new eyebrow piercing Pushing from a height just a week before, online..
[Message 72] Anya: Maybe he’s hiding something.
[Message 73] Liam: I'm going to dig deeper into this.
[Message 74] Anya: Okay, be careful.
[Message 75] Liam: Always am.
[Message 76] Anya: Good.
[Message 77] Anya: Hey Liam, I found out something about Naomi.
[Message 78] Liam: Who’s Naomi?
[Message 79] Anya: Naomi, remember? Works at the gym. She told me she saw Ben and Alex arguing last week. She said he purposefully caused the arguement.
[Message 80] Liam: About what?
[Message 81] Anya: She didn't know, but it got heated.
[Message 82] Liam: Damn. This is getting interesting.
[Message 83] Anya: I know, right?
[Message 84] Liam: I’m gonna go talk to Naomi myself.
[Message 85] Anya: Good luck. Let me know what you find out.
[Message 86] Liam: Will do.
[Message 87] Ben: Hey guys, just checking in. How are you holding up?
[Message 88] Anya: Doing okay, Ben. Just trying to process everything.
[Message 89] Liam: Still trying to figure things out.
[Message 90] Ben: Any leads?
[Message 91] Liam: Maybe.
[Message 92] Ben: Don't tell me you still suspect me...
[Message 93] Liam: I'm not ruling anyone out, Ben.
[Message 94] Ben: That's messed up.
[Message 95] Anya: Liam, that's enough.
[Message 96] Liam: Fine.
[Message 97] Ben: Thanks, Anya.
[Message 98] Anya: Anytime.
[Message 99] Liam: I heard Alex was in some financial trouble.
[Message 100] Ben: Really? I didn't know that.
[Message 101] Anya: Maybe that had something to do with it?
[Message 102] Liam: Could be.
[Message 103] Ben: Well, I gotta go. Talk later.
[Message 104] Anya: Okay, bye.
[Message 105] Liam: Later.
[Message 106] Liam: Anya, I just spoke to Naomi.
[Message 107] Anya: And?
[Message 108] Liam: She said Ben told her he hated Alex and that Alex had deserved it, right before he went over there.
[Message 109] Anya: Whoa.
[Message 110] Liam: She also said she saw Ben looking up how to make Pushing from a height online a week ago.
[Message 111] Anya: This is bad. Really bad.
[Message 112] Liam: I know.
[Message 113] Anya: We need to tell the police.
[Message 114] Liam: Agreed. I'm going now.
[Message 115] Anya: Good luck. I hope they catch him.
[Message 116] Liam: Me too. For Dana and Alex.
[Message 117] Anya: Yeah.
[Message 118] Ben: Hey, anyone know what time the coffee shop opens tomorrow?
[Message 119] Anya: Ben, seriously?
[Message 120] Liam: We know, Ben.
[Message 121] Ben: Know what?
[Message 122] Liam: Don't play dumb. Naomi told us everything.
[Message 123] Ben: Naomi is lying!
[Message 124] Anya: The police are on their way, Ben.
[Message 125] Ben: This is a setup!
[Message 126] Liam: No, Ben. This is justice.
[Message 127] Anya: You’re going away for a long time for this, Ben.
[Message 128] Ben: I didn't do anything!
[Message 129] Liam: Save it for the cops.
[Message 130] Ben: You'll regret this!
[Message 131] Anya: I doubt it.
[Message 132] Liam: Not as much as you'll regret what you did, Ben.
[Message 133] Anya: Yeah.

154,"[Message 1] Ben: Hey Sarah, you working tomorrow?
[Message 2] Sarah: Yeah, graveyard shift. Ugh. You?
[Message 3] Ben: Nah, off tomorrow. Gonna try that new VR place downtown.
[Message 4] Sarah: Lucky. Be careful though, heard it's kinda glitchy.
[Message 5] Ben: Will do! You be safe too. Heard there was that incident at Pharmacy last night. Crazy.
[Message 6] Sarah: I know, right? Poor Jamie. The Security Guard was just doing their job.
[Message 7] Chloe: Guys, seriously, stop talking about it. It’s making me anxious.
[Message 8] Ben: Sorry, Chloe. Just saying it's wild stuff.
[Message 9] Chloe: I saw Dale near Pharmacy last night around midnight. Thought it was weird. He was muttering to himself.
[Message 10] Sarah: Dale? Really? He's always seemed a bit off, tbh.
[Message 11] Ben: Dale always hated Jamie. Ever since Jamie fired him from the grocery store job.
[Message 12] Chloe: I didn’t know that. Still, doesn’t mean he…you know.
[Message 13] Sarah: True. Everyone's stressed these days.
[Message 14] Ben: Stress is one thing, Chloe. Didn't you say he seemed agitated? Was he near the back of the building?
[Message 15] Chloe: Yeah, kinda ranting about how people were out to get him. And yes, it was near the delivery entrance around back.
[Message 16] Sarah: Maybe he just needed his meds adjusted?
[Message 17] Chloe: Maybe. But it's still unsettling, given what happened to Jamie.
[Message 18] Ben: Yeah. This is awful. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 19] Sarah: Has anyone talked to Marcy? She knew Jamie well.
[Message 20] Chloe: I haven't. Thought she might need some space.
[Message 21] Ben: I can try reaching out.
[Message 22] Ben: Hey Marcy, how are you holding up?
[Message 23] Marcy: Not good, Ben. Not good at all. I keep replaying things in my head.
[Message 24] Ben: Anything you want to share? Anything at all?
[Message 25] Marcy: I remember Jamie was worried about Dale a few weeks ago. Said Dale was asking weird questions about…pharmaceuticals.
[Message 26] Ben: Pharmaceuticals? Like what?
[Message 27] Marcy: I don't know exactly. Just said it made them uncomfortable. Like Dale was researching how to make Administering a lethal injection online.
[Message 28] Sarah: Oh my god, Marcy. That's huge.
[Message 29] Chloe: This is getting really scary.
[Message 30] Ben: Marcy, did Jamie mention *why* Dale was asking about those things?
[Message 31] Marcy: They thought he was just being paranoid. Dale always thought people were trying to poison him or something. It seemed like a delusion.
[Message 32] Sarah: So, he thought he needed to protect himself? That's kinda… mens rea, right? Planning?
[Message 33] Chloe: Please stop with the cop shows. It makes me uncomfortable.
[Message 34] Ben: Guys, let's focus. Marcy, thanks for sharing.
[Message 35] Marcy: I just keep thinking, If I had taken Jamie out for coffee, like we planned that night, none of this would have happened.
[Message 36] Sarah: Don't blame yourself, Marcy. This isn't your fault.
[Message 37] Ben: Definitely not. Listen, I gotta go. VR time! I will circle back with everyone later.

[Message 2] Lex: Yeah, crazy. Old Man Hemlock, right?
[Message 3] River: Hemlock? The drug dealer? What happened?
[Message 4] Kai: Murdered. Hammer, apparently. Midday.
[Message 5] Quinn: OMG, that's awful! I was just there yesterday buying tomatoes.
[Message 6] Lex: Seriously? Hammer? That's brutal.
[Message 7] River: I heard Hemlock was dealing some heavy stuff. Probably ticked off the wrong people.
[Message 8] Kai: Maybe. Or maybe it was personal. He fired Bethany last month.
[Message 9] Bethany: WTF, Kai? You think I did it?
[Message 10] Kai: Just saying, motive, Bethany. You were furious.
[Message 11] Bethany: I was upset, sure, but murder? Seriously? I was with Ezra ALL day yesterday.
[Message 12] Ezra: Can confirm. We were binge-watching Star Trek.
[Message 13] Quinn: Bethany, you okay? This must be rough.
[Message 14] Bethany: I'm fine, Quinn. Just annoyed at Kai jumping to conclusions.
[Message 15] River: Lay off, Kai. It's a bit insensitive.
[Message 16] Lex: So, who else had beef with Hemlock? I heard he was screwing over some farmers.
[Message 17] Kai: Good point, Lex. He wasn't exactly a saint.
[Message 18] Quinn: This is just… I saw Officer Miller down there. It's serious.
[Message 19] River: Cops are probably talking to everyone who knew him.
[Message 20] Bethany: I hope they find who did this. Hemlock might have been a jerk, but he didn't deserve this.
[Message 21] Ezra: Poor guy.
[Message 22] Lex: Heard he stiffed Marco on a deal last week. Anyone know Marco?
[Message 23] Kai: Marco? Isn't he the one with the… religious views?
[Message 24] Quinn: Yeah, and he's got that weird intense stare. Makes me uncomfortable.
[Message 25] Marco: Leave me out of this, I was praying all day.
[Message 26] Bethany: Praying to what, Marco? The hammer gods?
[Message 27] Ezra: Bethany, dude, not cool.
[Message 28] Kai: Guys, let's not start pointing fingers. Let the police do their job.
[Message 29] Lex: True, true. Just brainstorming here. Wonder what Hemlock was up to that day?
[Message 30] River: Probably dealing. He always seemed anxious.
[Message 31] Quinn: I just feel so bad for his family.
[Message 32] Bethany: He didn't have any family. Just that mangy dog.
[Message 33] Ezra: That dog is gonna be lonely now.
[Message 34] Kai: Maybe he had more enemies than we knew.
[Message 35] Lex: Speaking of enemies, I saw River arguing with Hemlock last week. Something about ""promises.""
[Message 36] River: Lex, you’re imagining things. We just had a disagreement about prices.
[Message 37] Quinn: I thought I saw that too, River. You looked pretty heated.
[Message 38] River: Seriously guys? I sell flowers, I don't kill people. I have small hands anyway.
[Message 39] Bethany: Everyone's a suspect now, apparently.
[Message 40] Ezra: This is getting ridiculous.
[Message 41] Kai: Alright, alright. Let's change the subject. Anyone watching the game tonight?
[Message 42] Lex: Yeah, definitely. Need to take my mind off this.
[Message 43] River: I'm in. Anything is better than this conversation.
[Message 44] Quinn: Me too. Pizza at my place?
[Message 45] Bethany: Can't. Got that thing with Ezra.
[Message 46] Ezra: Yep, Trek marathon continues.
[Message 47] Marco: My prayers are with all of you.
[Message 48] Kai: Thanks, Marco. Appreciate it.
[Message 49] Lex: So, pizza at Quinn's. 7 pm?
[Message 50] River: Sounds good.
[Message 51] Quinn: Perfect. See you guys then.
[Message 52] Bethany: Still think I did it, Kai?
[Message 53] Kai: I didn't say that, Bethany. Just playing devil's advocate.
[Message 54] Lex: Anyone know what kind of hammer it was?
[Message 55] River: Why does that matter, Lex?
[Message 56] Lex: Just curious. Maybe it's a clue.
[Message 57] Quinn: Focus on happy thoughts, guys. Pizza soon!
[Message 58] Bethany: Happy thoughts are hard right now.
[Message 59] Ezra: I understand how you feel.
[Message 60] Kai: You think the cops will solve it quickly?
[Message 61] Lex: Depends. If they have solid evidence.
[Message 62] River: Or a good witness.
[Message 63] Quinn: I hope they don't drag this out.
[Message 64] Bethany: Me neither.
[Message 65] Ezra: Agreed.
[Message 66] Marco: Justice will prevail.
[Message 67] Kai: I’m thinking they are going away for a long time.
[Message 68] Lex: Yeah, murder one is no joke.
[Message 69] River: No kidding.
[Message 70] Quinn: So scary to think something like that happened in our city.
[Message 71] Bethany: It is. Makes you wonder about people.
[Message 72] Ezra: True.
[Message 73] Kai: Someone like Hemlock probably made a lot of enemies. Maybe it was intended to happen.
[Message 74] Lex: Maybe. Or maybe it was random.
[Message 75] River: Hard to say.
[Message 76] Quinn: Guys, seriously, pizza. Let’s stop dwelling.
[Message 77] Bethany: Okay, okay. Pizza sounds good.
[Message 78] Ezra: Can't wait.
[Message 79] Kai: I heard Hemlock recently got an expensive watch.
[Message 80] Lex: Probably fake. He always seemed shady.
[Message 81] River: Maybe that's what they were after.
[Message 82] Quinn: Or maybe they hated him.
[Message 83] Bethany: Or maybe he owed someone money.
[Message 84] Ezra: So many possibilities.
[Message 85] Marco: The root of all evil...
[Message 86] Kai: Exactly.
[Message 87] Lex: I am really hungry. Is it pizza time yet?

[Message 1] Alex: ""Hey Riley, you up?""
[Message 2] Riley: ""Yeah, insomnia hitting hard. What's up?""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Did you hear about what happened at the Pharmacy?""
[Message 4] Riley: ""No, what? Another robbery?""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Worse. Two people dead. Judge Thompson and some cop. At dawn.""
[Message 6] Riley: ""WHAT?! Judge Thompson? I knew her! That's insane.""
[Message 7] Riley: ""Who was the cop?""
[Message 8] Alex: ""Officer Miller, I think. Fresh out of the academy. Tragic.""
[Message 9] Jordan: ""OMG, I just saw the news. So messed up.""
[Message 10] Jordan: ""Alex, were you anywhere near there this morning? I know you sometimes grab coffee before work near that Pharmacy.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Jordan, seriously? I was home, asleep. Don't even joke about that.""
[Message 12] Jordan: ""Sorry, sorry. Just freaked out. This whole thing is crazy. Hope they catch whoever did it. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 13] Riley: ""Yeah, no kidding. What kind of monster...""
[Message 14] Alex: ""They said it was a stabbing. Brutal.""
[Message 15] Riley: ""Did they say anything about a motive?""
[Message 16] Alex: ""Robbery gone wrong, maybe? That's what the early reports are saying.""
[Message 17] Jordan: ""Maybe someone Judge Thompson pissed off? She was known to be Cynical""
[Message 18] Riley: ""Or a cop hater targeting Miller? This is Dallas, after all.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""True. So many possibilities.""
[Message 20] Riley: ""I feel sick. I need to get off my phone. Let me know if you hear anything else.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Will do. Try to get some sleep.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""Me too. Night, guys.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Night.""
[Message 24] Jordan: ""Hey Alex, did you ever find that Stabbing with a knife you were looking for online? You said you wanted to start cooking more.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Seriously, Jordan? Now is not the time. And I was looking at chef's knives, not... that. Jeez.""

[Message 31] Riley: ""Yeah, unfortunately. What is it?""
[Message 32] Alex: ""Something's bothering me about Jordan's questions. Seemed…off.""
[Message 33] Riley: ""Yeah, I noticed that too. Maybe they're just in shock and not thinking straight.""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Maybe. But I saw Jordan leave the building at Dawn yesterday. Don't know why he was there.""
[Message 35] Riley: ""Wait, really? You saw Jordan? That's weird. Did you say anything?""
[Message 36] Alex: ""No, I was across the street and didn't want to bother him if he was busy. Thought he was grabbing food or something.""
[Message 37] Riley: ""Hmm. Keep me posted if you remember anything else.""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Will do.""
[Message 39] Jordan: ""Hey guys, I can't shake this feeling. This city is going to hell.""
[Message 40] Riley: ""Tell me about it. Makes you wonder if anything is safe anymore.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Exactly. Makes me want to move.""

[Message 43] Riley: ""Montana? That's random.""
[Message 44] Jordan: ""Fresh air, fewer crazies. Just a thought.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""I've always wanted to visit. Never thought about living there.""
[Message 46] Riley: ""Well, let's solve this crime first before we all run off to Montana.""

[Message 49] Jordan: ""What? No! Just saying, crime is up everywhere. They're stretched thin.""
[Message 50] Riley: ""He's got a point, Alex.""

[Message 58] Alex: ""I just remembered something else about yesterday morning...""
[Message 59] Riley: ""What?""
[Message 60] Alex: ""I saw Jordan talking to a guy I've never seen before, near the Pharmacy. They looked like they were arguing.""
[Message 61] Riley: ""Did you get a good look at the guy?""
[Message 62] Alex: ""Not really. Tall, kinda hunched over. That's about it.""
[Message 63] Riley: ""Hunched over... that's not much to go on.""
[Message 64] Alex: ""I know. But the arguing part…maybe it’s nothing.""
[Message 65] Riley: ""Maybe. But it's worth remembering. We should tell the police about this.""
[Message 66] Alex: ""I don't know... what if I'm wrong? I don't want to get Jordan in trouble if he's innocent.""
[Message 67] Riley: ""True. Let's sit on it for a bit. See if anything else comes to light.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Agreed.""

[Message 71] Alex: ""Same here. Trying to focus on work.""
[Message 72] Jordan: ""Yeah, gotta keep busy. Distraction is key.""

[Message 74] Alex: ""That's awful. So young.""
[Message 75] Jordan: ""Tragic. Makes you wonder what the world is coming to.""
[Message 76] Riley: ""I saw on Facebook someone saying Judge Thompson was about to rule on a big case that could have made some enemies.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""That's possible. She was a tough Judge.""
[Message 78] Jordan: ""See? Plenty of motives. Could be anyone.""
[Message 79] Riley: ""Anyone who had access to the pharmacy that early, anyway.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Good point.""
[Message 81] Jordan: ""You think they'll release the security footage?""
[Message 82] Riley: ""Eventually, probably. But it could take a while.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Maybe the security footage will show that Jordan was there before it happened.""
[Message 84] Jordan: ""Why are you so obsessed with me being there, Alex? I was just getting a prescription filled. I'm trying to get notorious!""
[Message 85] Riley: ""Whoa, chill out, guys. No need to get defensive.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Sorry, Jordan. Just on edge.""
[Message 87] Jordan: ""Easy for you to say. You're not the one being interrogated via text.""

[Message 89] Alex: ""Okay, okay. My bad.""
[Message 90] Jordan: ""Yeah, whatever.""
[Message 91] Riley: ""Anyway, I was thinking about volunteering at a homeless shelter this weekend. Need to do something positive.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""That's a good idea, Riley. Maybe I'll join you.""
[Message 93] Jordan: ""I'm busy, but good for you guys.""
[Message 94] Riley: ""Okay, well, if you change your mind, let us know.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""Yeah, the more the merrier.""
[Message 96] Jordan: ""Whatever.""
[Message 97] Riley: ""Alex, can I ask you something in private?""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Sure, go ahead.""
[Message 99] Riley: ""*Private chat* I'm really starting to think Jordan knows more than he's letting on. All the defensiveness…""
[Message 100] Alex: ""*Private chat* I know, right? Especially the ""I'm trying to get notorious!"" comment. What was that about?""
[Message 101] Riley: ""*Private chat* Exactly! And him being at the Pharmacy at Dawn… I’m really worried.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""*Private chat* Me too. But we still don't have proof of anything. Just a bad feeling.""
[Message 103] Riley: ""*Private chat* We need to be careful. Maybe we should talk to the police anonymously.""

[Message 118] Alex: ""Riley, are you awake?""
[Message 119] Riley: ""Yeah, just barely. What's wrong?""
[Message 120] Alex: ""Jordan just texted me asking what we talked about privately. He's totally suspicious.""
[Message 121] Riley: ""I know! He asked me too. I told him it was nothing.""
[Message 122] Alex: ""He's definitely trying to figure out if we suspect him. We need to be careful.""

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, Marcia, just a lot on my mind. Work stuff.
[Message 3] DEVIN: Marcia, you hear about the accident down by the bank? Awful.
[Message 4] MARCIA: Devin, no! What happened?
[Message 5] DEVIN: Some kinda car crash. Two people dead. Apparently, it was EARLY MORNING
[Message 6] LIAM: EARLY MORNING? Damn.
[Message 7] CHLOE: OMG that's awful. Anyone we know?
[Message 8] DEVIN: Think I saw it on the news, one of them was a 4.  Journalist named Sarah
[Message 9] MARCIA: Sarah? Oh my god, I know Sarah. She was such a sweet person.
[Message 10] LIAM: Yeah, real tragedy. Hey Devin, you free later? Need to bounce something off you.
[Message 11] DEVIN: Sure, Liam. After 5?
[Message 12] LIAM: Perfect. Chloe, you still on for that movie tomorrow?
[Message 13] CHLOE: Yep! Looking forward to it. Need some distraction.
[Message 14] MARCIA: Distraction from what? Besides the obvious tragedy
[Message 15] CHLOE: Just stressed about work. Deadlines are killing me.
[Message 16] DEVIN: Speaking of work, gotta run. See you guys later. Liam, 5 it is.
[Message 17] LIAM: Later, Devin.
[Message 18] MARCIA: I was going to say, Didnt sarah work at the bank?
[Message 19] CHLOE: I didn't know that, Marcia. Poor thing.
[Message 20] LIAM: Wait, I thought you said she was a 4.  Journalist Devin?
[Message 21] DEVIN: I thought she worked at the bank previously? maybe she was freelancing now.
[Message 22] CHLOE: This whole thing is so messed up. Hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 23] MARCIA: Me too. They're going away for a long time for this
[Message 24] LIAM: Amen to that. Anyway, I need to grab some coffee. Talk later?
[Message 25] CHLOE: Sure. Later, Liam. Marcia, you okay? You seem…intense.
[Message 26] MARCIA: I just…I can't shake this feeling something's not right. I saw Devin buying Car accident (vehicular homicide) yesterday.
[Message 27] CHLOE: Car accident (vehicular homicide)? That's weird, but maybe he needed it for his car?
[Message 28] MARCIA: Maybe. But he always hated 4.  Journalist
[Message 29] CHLOE: Woah, Marcia, don’t go jumping to conclusions. That’s a serious accusation.
[Message 30] MARCIA: I know, I know. Just…be careful, okay?
[Message 31] CHLOE: Always am. You too.
[Message 32] LIAM: (To Devin) Hey, things got a little heated with Marcia and Chloe, mind changing our meeting place to my apartment?
[Message 33] DEVIN: (To Liam) Sure, no problem. See you soon. I heard that Sarah was investigating some shady deals the victims were involved in, like she was purposefully getting to close to the truth.
[Message 34] LIAM: (To Devin) That makes sense. Good thing its not our business
[Message 35] LIAM: (To Devin) Listen, about this morning. I might have seen you leave the building at Early Morning. You know the Car accident (vehicular homicide) was an accident, right?
[Message 36] DEVIN: (To Liam) Yeah, of course it was. So youre saying you saw me leave the building at the time of the murder, I mean accident?
[Message 37] LIAM: (To Devin) Look, I just want to make sure we're on the same page. They will find out what happened eventually.
[Message 38] DEVIN: (To Liam) I understand. I think that someonw might have been angry about getting fired from the firm for insider trading. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 39] DEVIN: (To Liam) He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 40] LIAM: (To Devin) I see. I just don’t want to go down for anything, you know?
[Message 41] DEVIN: (To Liam) Of course, man. We’re in this together.
[Message 42] CHLOE: (To Marcia) Just heard from Liam, he's acting weird. Asked if I knew anything about the accident.
[Message 43] MARCIA: (To Chloe) See? Something’s definitely up.
[Message 44] CHLOE: (To Marcia) He said Devin tried to talk him out of it, whatever ""it"" is.

[Message 5] Finn: David? The corrections officer? Man, that's rough. I used to see him at the gym.

[Message 6] Chloe: I know, right? Poor guy.

[Message 7] Ash: Whoa, seriously? Murder? In Greenville?

[Message 8] Liam: Yeah. Midnight. Apparently, it was brutal.

[Message 9] Chloe: Police haven't released much info, have they?

[Message 10] Finn: Nah, just that they’re investigating.

[Message 11] Ash: This is insane.

[Message 20] Ash: Well, share the rumors!

[Message 21] Chloe: Something about a stabbing.

[Message 22] Liam: Yikes.

[Message 23] Finn: Brutal.

[Message 24] Ash: I knew David a little. He was always on edge, like he was expecting something bad to happen.

[Message 25] Chloe: Maybe he knew something we didn’t.

[Message 26] Liam: Maybe. Or maybe he was just anxious.

[Message 27] Finn: He worked at the prison. Probably saw a lot of messed up stuff.

[Message 28] Ash: Good point. Still, creepy.

[Message 29] Chloe: So, anyone hear anything about suspects?

[Message 30] Liam: Not a peep.

[Message 31] Finn: Probably too early.

[Message 32] Ash: I heard he got into an argument with some kid a few weeks ago at bar across the street. Some punk with a tongue ring.

[Message 33] Chloe: That could be something.

[Message 34] Liam: A tongue ring? Seriously?

[Message 35] Finn: People fight all the time. Doesn't mean they commit murder.

[Message 36] Ash: Yeah, true. But still.

[Message 38] Finn: Haha, very funny, Chloe. I was home, playing video games.

[Message 39] Liam: Same here.

[Message 41] Chloe: Anyone know his family?

[Message 42] Liam: I think he had a sister.

[Message 51] Chloe: Not really. Just trying to process all this.

[Message 52] Finn: Yeah, me too. It’s messed up.

[Message 53] Ash: Hey Chloe, you were at that protest last month right?

[Message 54] Chloe: Yeah, why?

[Message 55] Ash: Just wondering. David had some pretty strong opinions about those things.

[Message 56] Chloe: So? Lots of people have opinions. Doesn't make me a suspect.

[Message 57] Finn: Chill, Ash.

[Message 58] Ash: I’m just saying.

[Message 59] Chloe: He also fired my friend, so if anyone had a motive, it would be me.

[Message 60] Finn: Wow, Chloe, that's not something to joke about.

[Message 61] Chloe: I'm not joking. I'm pointing out how easy it is to make assumptions.

[Message 73] Chloe: Just wondering, anyway i should go.

[Message 74] Ash: Wait, I have to get something off my chest.

[Message 75] Chloe: What is it?

[Message 76] Ash: I was short on money recently and David made me a loan a month back. I'm having trouble paying it back, I dont wanna look suspicious, but the money is missing.

[Message 77] Chloe: Now thats a big problem.

[Message 78] Ash: I know.

[Message 79] Chloe: Did you try talking to his family to see if they found it?

[Message 2] Alex: Tired, but good to be off work! How was the drive, Liam?
[Message 3] River: Doing well! Just picked up my prescription at Wee Hours. Reminded me of when I was a kid and used to get candy there.
[Message 4] Jordan: Wee Hours still kicking? Wow. That place is ancient.
[Message 5] Liam: The drive was alright, Alex. Long, as always. Anything exciting happen with you guys today?
[Message 6] Alex: Not much here, Liam. Mostly just crunching numbers. River, what kind of candy did they have back then?
[Message 7] River: Oh man, they had everything! Jawbreakers, Mary Janes, those little wax bottles with juice inside...
[Message 8] Jordan: Wax bottles! I completely forgot about those. The juice was always so weirdly flavored.
[Message 9] Liam: I remember those too! We used to get them after fishing trips.
[Message 10] Alex: Fishing trips, Liam? Did you catch anything good?
[Message 11] Liam: Sometimes! Mostly just sunfish and the occasional small bass. Nothing brag-worthy.
[Message 12] River: I wish I'd gone fishing more as a kid. I was always stuck inside reading.
[Message 13] Jordan: Reading is good! I was always getting into trouble, so reading was my escape.
[Message 14] Alex: What were you reading, River?
[Message 15] River: Mostly fantasy and sci-fi. Big Tolkien fan. Still am, actually.
[Message 16] Liam: My grandpa tried to get me into Tolkien. Never stuck. Too many elves.
[Message 17] Jordan: Elves are alright. I prefer a good mystery.
[Message 18] Alex: I'm more of a non-fiction kind of person myself. History, mostly.
[Message 19] River: I dabbled in history too! Ancient Egypt was always fascinating to me.
[Message 20] Liam: Egypt? Snakes and pyramids. Not my cup of tea.
[Message 21] Jordan: Okay, someone tell me a good book. I need something to read.
[Message 22] Alex: ""Sapiens"" by Yuval Noah Harari is pretty good. Thought-provoking.
[Message 23] River: For fiction, I'd recommend anything by Neil Gaiman. ""American Gods"" is a good place to start.
[Message 24] Liam: I'll stick to my fishing magazines. Thanks, though.
[Message 25] Jordan: I'll check out Gaiman. Thanks, River!
[Message 26] Alex: So, anyone got any fun plans for the weekend?
[Message 27] River: I'm hoping to get some writing done. Maybe visit a museum.
[Message 28] Liam: Fishing, if the weather holds up.
[Message 29] Jordan: I might try that new restaurant downtown. Heard good things.
[Message 30] Alex: Which one? The Italian place?
[Message 31] Jordan: Yeah, Bella Notte or something like that.
[Message 32] River: Oh, I've heard of that place. Let me know if it's any good!
[Message 33] Liam: Italian food is good. As long as there's no anchovies.
[Message 34] Alex: Anchovies are an acquired taste.
[Message 35] River: I actually like anchovies! On pizza, specifically.
[Message 36] Jordan: Okay, now you're just trying to start a fight.
[Message 37] Liam: Anchovies belong in the garbage.
[Message 38] Alex: To each their own. More for River, I guess.
[Message 39] River: Haha, exactly!
[Message 40] Jordan: So, back to childhood memories... anyone ever have a really embarrassing school picture?
[Message 41] Liam: Oh god, yes. I had a terrible bowl cut.
[Message 42] Alex: Bowl cuts were the style back then!
[Message 43] River: I had braces and a perm. It was a disaster.
[Message 44] Jordan: Ouch. My mom made me wear this ridiculous floral dress. I looked like a grandma.
[Message 45] Liam: Floral dresses are making a comeback, Jordan!
[Message 46] Alex: Everything comes back eventually.
[Message 47] River: I'm just glad perms are out.
[Message 48] Jordan: Agreed. Anything else interesting happen today? Besides Wee Hours nostalgia?
[Message 49] Liam: I saw a deer on the side of the road. That was kind of interesting.
[Message 50] Alex: Always a bit scary when they're near the road.
[Message 51] River: I had a good writing session, actually. Got a lot done on my new story.
[Message 52] Jordan: That's awesome, River! What's it about?
[Message 53] River: It's a sci-fi thing, about a colony on Mars.
[Message 54] Liam: Mars? Sounds complicated.
[Message 55] Alex: I'm sure it's great, River.
[Message 56] Jordan: I'd read that.
[Message 57] River: Thanks guys! Appreciate it.

[Message 63] Alex: Goodnight!

[Message 65] Liam: Quick question before I go... anyone ever work a really terrible summer job?
[Message 66] Alex: Oh yeah. I worked at a fast food place. Grease everywhere.
[Message 67] River: I was a telemarketer. It was soul-crushing.
[Message 68] Jordan: I was a lifeguard at a really gross public pool.
[Message 69] Liam: I picked strawberries. My back was killing me.
[Message 70] Alex: Those all sound pretty awful.
[Message 71] River: I think telemarketing takes the cake.
[Message 72] Jordan: Maybe. But dealing with screaming kids covered in sunscreen...
[Message 73] Liam: Strawberries were at least... edible.
[Message 74] Alex: True.
[Message 75] River: Okay, I concede. Lifeguarding sounds worse.
[Message 76] Jordan: Finally!
[Message 77] Liam: Alright, NOW I'm heading out. Seriously.
[Message 78] Alex: Okay, see ya!
[Message 79] River: Bye Liam!
[Message 80] Jordan: Bye!
[Message 81] Alex: So, River, how's the writing going in general? Feeling inspired?
[Message 82] River: Pretty good, actually! I've been on a roll lately.
[Message 83] Jordan: That's fantastic! It's always nice when the creativity is flowing.
[Message 84] Alex: Agreed. Inspiration is a fickle thing.
[Message 85] River: Tell me about it! Sometimes I stare at a blank page for hours.
[Message 86] Jordan: I get that. It's the same with cooking sometimes. You just can't think of anything good to make.
[Message 87] Alex: I can't even imagine having to be creative like that for a job.
[Message 88] River: It has its ups and downs, for sure.
[Message 89] Jordan: Speaking of jobs, anyone have any particularly memorable job interviews? Good or bad?
[Message 90] Alex: I had one where I completely blanked on a really basic question. It was mortifying.
[Message 91] River: Oh no! What was the question?
[Message 92] Alex: Something about financial ratios. I'm a financial analyst! I should have known it.
[Message 93] Jordan: We all have those moments. Don't beat yourself up.
[Message 94] River: I had an interview where I spilled coffee all over the interviewer.
[Message 95] Jordan: Oh my god!
[Message 96] Alex: That's even worse than forgetting a financial ratio!
[Message 97] River: I thought I'd blown it for sure, but I still got the job!
[Message 98] Jordan: Wow! That's amazing. Maybe they felt sorry for you.
[Message 99] Alex: Maybe they appreciated your honesty about being clumsy.
[Message 100] River: Haha, maybe.
[Message 101] Jordan: I had an interview where the guy kept staring at my chest. I walked out.
[Message 102] Alex: Good for you! That's completely unacceptable.
[Message 103] River: Absolutely.
[Message 104] Jordan: Yeah, I wasn't sticking around for that.
[Message 105] Alex: You did the right thing. There are plenty of other jobs out there.
[Message 106] River: Definitely. You deserve to be treated with respect.
[Message 107] Jordan: Thanks, guys. It was a while ago, but it still makes me mad.
[Message 108] Alex: It's understandable.
[Message 109] River: Some people are just awful.
[Message 110] Jordan: True. Anyway, enough about bad interviews. What's everyone having for dinner?
[Message 111] Alex: I'm thinking of making a salad.
[Message 112] River: I'm going to order pizza.
[Message 113] Jordan: I'm making a stir-fry.
[Message 114] Alex: Sounds good, everyone!
[Message 115] River: Pizza sounds amazing right now.
[Message 116] Jordan: Stir-fry is pretty quick and easy.
[Message 117] Alex: I should probably try to eat healthier.
[Message 118] River: Pizza can be healthy! If you get it with vegetables.
[Message 119] Jordan: Or if you only eat one slice.
[Message 120] Alex: That's the problem. I can't eat just one slice.
[Message 121] River: Haha, me neither.
[Message 122] Jordan: Alright, I'm gonna start cooking. Chat later!
[Message 123] Alex: Have a good dinner!
[Message 124] River: Bye!

[Message 128] River: Yep! Can't go wrong with a classic.
[Message 129] Alex: True.
[Message 130] River: So, what kind of salad are you making?
[Message 131] Alex: Just a simple mixed greens with some grilled chicken.
[Message 132] River: Sounds healthy and delicious!
[Message 133] Alex: I try.
[Message 134] River: I should probably eat more salads.
[Message 135] Alex: We all should.
[Message 136] River: Maybe tomorrow.
[Message 137] Alex: One step at a time.
[Message 138] River: Exactly.
[Message 139] Alex: Well, I'm gonna go make my salad.

[Message 163] River: That sounds relaxing.
[Message 164] Alex: It is.

[Message 2] Alex: Yep! Just got here. So many options… overwhelmed already. Home decor, right?
[Message 3] Quinn: Yeah, something for their new place. I was thinking maybe a cool vase or something abstract? My sculpting experience makes me partial to unusual shapes.
[Message 4] Alex: A vase is a good idea. Practical and stylish. I saw a really nice ceramic one over here. It’s kind of… rustic?
[Message 5] Quinn: Rustic could work! What color is it? Their place is pretty modern, I think. Mostly grays and whites.
[Message 6] Alex: It's a sort of creamy off-white with some brown speckles. Very earthy.
[Message 7] Quinn: Hmm, earthy could be a nice contrast. Send me a pic if you can?
[Message 8] Alex: Okay, one sec... *attachment: image of a ceramic vase*
[Message 9] Quinn: Ooh, I like that! It's got a nice texture.
[Message 10] Alex: Right? It feels well-made, too.
[Message 11] Quinn: How much is it?
[Message 12] Alex: Let me check… $45.
[Message 13] Quinn: Not bad! I was thinking we could spend around $100 total.
[Message 14] Alex: Okay, so that leaves us with $55 for something else. Maybe some nice candles?
[Message 15] Quinn: Candles are always a good option. What kind of scents do you think they'd like?
[Message 16] Alex: Hmm, Sarah likes floral scents, I think. I remember her mentioning lavender once.
[Message 17] Quinn: Lavender sounds good. Maybe something citrusy too?
[Message 18] Alex: Yeah, a citrus blend would be refreshing. I'll see what they have.
[Message 19] Quinn: Perfect! In the meantime, I'm browsing the art section. Any interesting sculptures catch your eye?
[Message 20] Alex: Not yet, but I'll keep an eye out. Focusing on candles for now. So many choices!
[Message 21] Quinn: Take your time! No rush.
[Message 22] Alex: Okay, found a nice lavender and chamomile set. Comes in a cute little box.
[Message 23] Quinn: Chamomile is relaxing. Sounds perfect for a new home.
[Message 24] Alex: Yeah, I thought so too. And it's on sale! $20.
[Message 25] Quinn: Score! So, vase and candles. Anything else we should consider?
[Message 26] Alex: Maybe a nice throw blanket? Their couch looked a little bare at the engagement party.
[Message 27] Quinn: A throw blanket! That's a great idea! What color? Something that goes with gray and white?
[Message 28] Alex: Exactly! Maybe a soft blue or a muted green?
[Message 29] Quinn: Ooh, soft blue sounds lovely. Like a periwinkle shade?
[Message 30] Alex: Yeah, periwinkle would be perfect! I'll go look in the blanket section.
[Message 31] Quinn: Awesome! Let me know what you find.
[Message 32] Alex: Okay, I see a periwinkle one! It's super soft, too. Cashmere blend.
[Message 33] Quinn: Cashmere! Fancy. How much?
[Message 34] Alex: …$75. A bit over budget.
[Message 35] Quinn: Hmm, that is a bit much. Maybe something less… luxurious?
[Message 36] Alex: Yeah, good point. I'll keep looking. There's a cotton one in a similar color.
[Message 37] Quinn: Cotton sounds great. Practical and comfy.
[Message 38] Alex: Okay, found a cotton one! It's a nice knit pattern, too.
[Message 39] Quinn: How much is that one?
[Message 40] Alex: $30. Much better!
[Message 41] Quinn: Perfect! Vase, candles, and blanket. I think we've got a winner!
[Message 42] Alex: Agreed! I'll grab everything and meet you at the checkout?
[Message 43] Quinn: Sounds like a plan! I'm heading there now.
[Message 44] Alex: Great! See you in a few.
[Message 45] Quinn: See ya!
[Message 46] Alex: *10 minutes later* At the checkout. Got everything.
[Message 47] Quinn: Cool, I'm here too. Just admiring this giant stuffed giraffe.
[Message 48] Alex: Haha, classic toy store distraction.
[Message 49] Quinn: Seriously! I almost want to buy it for myself.
[Message 50] Alex: Resist! We’re here for Sarah and Tom.
[Message 51] Quinn: You're right, you're right. Okay, focusing on the task at hand.
[Message 52] Alex: Good. So, should we split the cost?
[Message 53] Quinn: Yeah, split it sounds fair.
[Message 54] Alex: Okay, great. Ready to pay when you are.
[Message 55] Quinn: I'm good to go. Let's do this!
[Message 56] Alex: Awesome! *a few minutes later* All paid!
[Message 57] Quinn: Yay! Gift acquired. Now, for wrapping paper...
[Message 58] Alex: Oh good point! I forgot about that.
[Message 59] Quinn: They have a whole section here. Let's go find something nice.
[Message 60] Alex: Lead the way!
[Message 61] Quinn: *browsing the wrapping paper* Ooh, this one with the little flowers is cute!
[Message 62] Alex: That is nice! Very springy.
[Message 63] Quinn: Yeah, perfect for a wedding. And it's recycled paper, which is a bonus.
[Message 64] Alex: Even better! Let's grab that. And some ribbon?
[Message 65] Quinn: Definitely ribbon. Maybe a satin ribbon in a complementary color?
[Message 66] Alex: I like the way you think. I see a nice pale green one.
[Message 67] Quinn: Pale green would be perfect! Let's get it.
[Message 68] Alex: Okay, wrapping supplies acquired!
[Message 69] Quinn: Mission accomplished! Now, coffee? I need a caffeine boost after all that decision-making.
[Message 70] Alex: Coffee sounds amazing. There's that little cafe across the street.
[Message 71] Quinn: Perfect! Let's head over there.
[Message 72] Alex: *walking to the cafe* You know, it's so nice to get out and do this kind of thing.
[Message 73] Quinn: I agree! Beats sitting at home all day. Especially since I've been stuck on this sculpture idea and just can't seem to execute it.
[Message 74] Alex: Ah, sculptor's block! Happens to the best of us. Baking can be the same way sometimes.
[Message 75] Quinn: What are you working on baking-wise these days?
[Message 76] Alex: Trying to perfect my sourdough recipe. It's a never-ending quest!
[Message 77] Quinn: Sourdough! That's ambitious. I've never even attempted it.
[Message 78] Alex: It's challenging, but so rewarding when it finally works.
[Message 79] Quinn: I can imagine! Maybe you could bake Sarah and Tom a loaf as a housewarming gift?
[Message 80] Alex: That's a sweet idea! I might just do that.
[Message 81] Quinn: They'd love it! Homemade bread is always appreciated.
[Message 82] Alex: True. Okay, we're here at the cafe. What are you having?
[Message 83] Quinn: I'm thinking a latte. Extra shot of espresso.
[Message 84] Alex: I'll go with a cappuccino. And maybe a pastry...
[Message 85] Quinn: Treat yourself! You deserve it after all that shopping.
[Message 86] Alex: Haha, you're right. Okay, I'm ordering.
[Message 87] Quinn: I'll grab a table.
[Message 88] Alex: *a few minutes later, at the table with coffees* This is exactly what I needed.
[Message 89] Quinn: Me too. This latte is hitting the spot.
[Message 90] Alex: So, are you going to work on your sculpture this weekend?
[Message 91] Quinn: I'm planning to. I've got to break through this block somehow.
[Message 92] Alex: Maybe try a different medium? Sometimes a change of scenery can help.
[Message 93] Quinn: That's a good idea. I might try working with clay instead of metal.
[Message 94] Alex: Yeah, clay is very forgiving.
[Message 95] Quinn: True. And it's a lot less noisy! My neighbors will appreciate that.
[Message 96] Alex: Haha, definitely!
[Message 97] Quinn: What about you? Any baking plans for the weekend?
[Message 98] Alex: Besides the sourdough, I'm thinking of making a batch of cookies. Maybe chocolate chip.
[Message 99] Quinn: Chocolate chip cookies are a classic! You can't go wrong with those.
[Message 100] Alex: Exactly! They're always a crowd-pleaser.
[Message 101] Quinn: Speaking of crowds, are you looking forward to the wedding reception?
[Message 102] Alex: I am! It'll be nice to see everyone. And to celebrate Sarah and Tom.
[Message 103] Quinn: Definitely! They're such a sweet couple.
[Message 104] Alex: They really are. I'm so happy for them.
[Message 105] Quinn: Me too. I'm glad we could get them a nice gift.
[Message 106] Alex: Yeah, it was fun shopping together.
[Message 107] Quinn: We make a good team!
[Message 108] Alex: We do!
[Message 109] Quinn: So, are you bringing a date to the wedding?
[Message 110] Alex: Nope, just going solo. You?
[Message 111] Quinn: Same here. Figured I'd just mingle and enjoy the music.
[Message 112] Alex: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 113] Quinn: I heard they're having a live band.
[Message 114] Alex: Oh, that's awesome! I love live music.
[Message 115] Quinn: Me too! I'm looking forward to dancing.
[Message 116] Alex: Haha, I'm not much of a dancer, but I'll definitely tap my foot to the beat.
[Message 117] Quinn: That's all that matters!
[Message 118] Alex: So, what are you wearing to the wedding?
[Message 119] Quinn: I haven't decided yet! I was thinking maybe a nice dress pants and button down. Something comfortable.
[Message 120] Alex: That sounds good. I'm probably just going to wear a nice button down and slacks.
[Message 121] Quinn: Classic and stylish!
[Message 122] Alex: Exactly!
[Message 123] Quinn: Okay, I think I'm starting to feel a little more awake now. This latte was a lifesaver.
[Message 124] Alex: Me too! That pastry definitely helped.
[Message 125] Quinn: What kind did you get?
[Message 126] Alex: A blueberry muffin. My favorite!
[Message 127] Quinn: Good choice!
[Message 128] Alex: So, should we head back to our respective homes?
[Message 129] Quinn: Yeah, I think so. I need to wrap that gift and then maybe take a nap.
[Message 130] Alex: Sounds like a good plan. I need to get started on that sourdough.
[Message 131] Quinn: Good luck with the sourdough!
[Message 132] Alex: Thanks! I'll need it.
[Message 133] Quinn: Well, it was fun hanging out with you today!
[Message 134] Alex: You too! We should do this again sometime.
[Message 135] Quinn: Definitely! Maybe next time we can go thrifting.
[Message 136] Alex: Ooh, I love thrifting! That's a great idea.
[Message 137] Quinn: We could find some really unique pieces for our homes.
[Message 138] Alex: Absolutely! Okay, I'm heading out now.
[Message 139] Quinn: Alright, have a good afternoon!
[Message 140] Alex: You too! Talk to you soon.
[Message 141] Quinn: Bye!
[Message 142] Alex: Bye!
[Message 143] Quinn: P.S. I saw a sign that said ""Free Puppies"" nearby... Don't get any ideas!
[Message 144] Alex: Haha, no promises! I do love puppies...
[Message 145] Quinn: Resist the urge!
[Message 146] Alex: Okay, okay. I'll try!
[Message 147] Quinn: Good!
[Message 148] Alex: Just thinking about them...so cute!
[Message 149] Quinn: Focus on the sourdough!
[Message 150] Alex: Right, sourdough. I will.
[Message 151] Quinn: That's the spirit!
[Message 152] Alex: Maybe I'll bake a sourdough shaped like a puppy...
[Message 153] Quinn: Now you're just messing with me!
[Message 154] Alex: Maybe a little...
[Message 155] Quinn: You're incorrigible!
[Message 156] Alex: Haha, you know me too well.
[Message 157] Quinn: I do! Okay, I'm seriously leaving now.
[Message 158] Alex: Alright, alright. Safe travels!
[Message 159] Quinn: You too!
[Message 160] Alex: *Later that evening* Hey, just wanted to say the sourdough is rising nicely!
[Message 161] Quinn: Awesome! Send me a picture when it's done.
[Message 162] Alex: Will do! And... I didn't get a puppy.
[Message 163] Quinn: I'm so proud of you!
[Message 164] Alex: It was a close call though.
[Message 165] Quinn: I can imagine.
[Message 166] Alex: Anyway, I'm going to bed now. Early start tomorrow.
[Message 167] Quinn: Sleep well!
[Message 168] Alex: You too!
[Message 169] Quinn: Goodnight!
[Message 170] Alex: Goodnight!
[Message 171] Quinn: Seriously, goodnight!
[Message 172] Alex: Okay, okay! Goodnight for real this time.

[Message 2] Maya: Morning, Liam! Absolutely gorgeous. Ready to admire some plants, Alex?
[Message 3] Alex: Morning! Always ready for some plant admiration. Especially early in the morning like this. The light is perfect.
[Message 4] Liam: Did you guys see the new rose garden they were working on last week?
[Message 5] Maya: No, I missed that! I was focused on the herb garden. I'm trying to grow more herbs this year.
[Message 6] Alex: Oh, the herb garden is lovely. I need to remember to take some photos there later.
[Message 7] Liam: Herbs are great. I use them a lot when I'm cooking.
[Message 8] Maya: Me too! Fresh herbs make such a difference. What are your favorites, Liam?
[Message 9] Liam: Rosemary and thyme are my go-to. What about you, Alex? You ever cook with herbs?
[Message 10] Alex: I mostly bake, so not as much. But I do use lavender sometimes, for shortbread.
[Message 11] Maya: Lavender shortbread? That sounds amazing!
[Message 12] Alex: It's pretty good! I got the recipe from an old book.
[Message 13] Liam: I need that recipe! Haha. Back to the roses - any particular kind you're hoping for, Maya?
[Message 14] Maya: Oh, I'm just excited to see what they've chosen. I love the old English roses.
[Message 15] Alex: I love the really vibrant colors. The contrast against the green foliage is just stunning.
[Message 16] Liam: Agreed! So, anyone got plans for dinner tonight? My family's thinking of grilling.
[Message 17] Maya: Grilling sounds amazing. We're having a simple pasta dish tonight.
[Message 18] Alex: I'm actually working tonight. Dinner will be... whatever I can find in the fridge when I get home, haha.
[Message 19] Liam: Ah, that's a bummer, Alex. Maybe leftovers tomorrow?
[Message 20] Alex: Definitely! Leftovers are the best, aren't they?
[Message 21] Maya: Absolutely! Especially when someone else has cooked them.
[Message 22] Liam: True that! Okay, let's go check out this rose garden then. Alex, you bringing your camera?
[Message 23] Alex: Of course! Never leave home without it.
[Message 24] Maya: Excellent! We'll need your artistic eye.
[Message 25] Liam: So, Maya, any tips for growing basil? Mine always seems to wilt.
[Message 26] Maya: Basil can be tricky. Make sure it's getting plenty of sun, and don't overwater it. Well-draining soil is key.
[Message 27] Alex: Sun is so important. I always underestimate how much light plants need.
[Message 28] Liam: Noted! Thanks, Maya. I'll try that. Maybe I need a sunnier spot in my garden.
[Message 29] Maya: Good luck! And don't be afraid to prune it back. That encourages growth.
[Message 30] Alex: Pruning is scary! I'm always worried I'll kill the plant.
[Message 31] Liam: Haha, me too! But Maya's right, it usually helps.
[Message 32] Maya: You can't be afraid to experiment a little. That's how you learn.
[Message 33] Alex: Wise words. I should try being less cautious.
[Message 34] Liam: Speaking of learning, I saw a writing workshop advertised at the library. Might be fun, Maya?
[Message 35] Maya: Ooh, that does sound interesting! What kind of writing?
[Message 36] Liam: I think it was general fiction. Could be a good way to get some feedback.
[Message 37] Maya: I might look into that. Thanks, Liam!
[Message 38] Alex: While you guys are writing, I'll be busy trying to capture the perfect light on a dewdrop.
[Message 39] Liam: Haha, we'll need to see those photos, Alex!
[Message 40] Maya: Definitely! You always take such beautiful pictures.
[Message 41] Alex: I try my best. This garden makes it easy, though.
[Message 42] Liam: So true. It's a little oasis in the city.
[Message 43] Maya: Completely agree. It's so peaceful here in the mornings.
[Message 44] Alex: It's a good way to start the day, for sure. Better than doomscrolling, that's for sure.
[Message 45] Liam: Haha, preach! Okay, rose garden time!
[Message 46] Maya: Lead the way!
[Message 47] Alex: Coming! Camera's ready.
[Message 48] Liam: Ooh, look at that climbing rose! Stunning.

[Message 53] Maya: I wonder what kind it is. Maybe we can find a label.
[Message 54] Liam: Let's check. I'm curious too.
[Message 55] Alex: Found one! It's labeled ""Lady Emma Hamilton.""
[Message 56] Maya: Lady Emma Hamilton? That's a beautiful name.
[Message 57] Liam: It suits the rose perfectly.
[Message 58] Alex: It really does. I'm going to look that up later.
[Message 59] Maya: Me too! Okay, what's next on our garden tour?
[Message 60] Liam: How about the Japanese garden? It's always so calming.
[Message 61] Alex: Sounds lovely. I'm in.
[Message 62] Maya: Let's go! I could use some calming vibes.
[Message 63] Liam: After that, coffee? I need a caffeine boost.

[Message 2] Jamie: Long week already! Had back-to-back patient appointments. How about you, Alex?
[Message 3] Alex: Pretty hectic too. Flu season is definitely keeping us busy at the pharmacy.
[Message 4] Riley: Construction's been slow. Weather's been messing with our schedule.
[Message 5] Jordan: Tell me about it, Riley. Market's so unpredictable right now. Makes investing stressful.
[Message 6] Jamie: Pharmacy, construction, investing... we're a diverse bunch! Anyone catch that new episode of ""Comet Chasers"" last night?
[Message 7] Alex: Oh, is that the one you were telling me about last week? I might check it out.
[Message 8] Jamie: You should! So good. Anyway, back to work... How are those teacher-student conferences going, Riley? Your grandkid's, right?
[Message 9] Riley: Yeah, little Timmy's. His teacher wants to talk about his reading comprehension. He's a bright kid, just gets distracted easily.
[Message 10] Jordan: Distraction is a common theme these days. Tough for kids to focus.
[Message 11] Alex: It is. At least we have caffeine to help us adults.
[Message 12] Jamie: Truer words! I swear, my coffee intake has doubled this week.
[Message 13] Riley: Haha, I stick to tea myself. Less jittery.
[Message 14] Jordan: Used to drink coffee, now it's just herbal tea. Gotta watch the heart.
[Message 15] Alex: Good point, Jordan. I should probably cut back.
[Message 16] Jamie: So, Riley, any specific concerns from Timmy's teacher besides the distraction?
[Message 17] Riley: Just that and maybe his participation in class. He's a bit shy.
[Message 18] Alex: That's understandable. Some kids just take a while to warm up.
[Message 19] Jordan: Patience is key. Hard to remember sometimes, though.
[Message 20] Jamie: Totally. Speaking of patience, anyone have any sculpting projects in the works, Alex?
[Message 21] Alex: I'm working on a small bust. It's proving trickier than I thought!
[Message 22] Riley: Sounds interesting. Always admired people who can create things with their hands.
[Message 23] Alex: Thanks, Riley! It's a good way to de-stress after a long day.
[Message 24] Jordan: Stress relief is definitely important. Wish I had more time for hobbies.
[Message 25] Jamie: Investing IS a hobby, isn't it, Jordan? A stressful one, but still...
[Message 26] Jordan: Sometimes feels more like a job! A very precarious one.
[Message 27] Alex: I can imagine! So, any big plans for the weekend, everyone?
[Message 28] Jamie: Thinking of trying that new vegan place downtown.
[Message 29] Riley: Might take Timmy to the park, weather permitting.
[Message 30] Jordan: Going over my portfolio. Exciting stuff, I know.
[Message 31] Alex: I'm hoping to spend some time in the studio. Maybe finish that bust!
[Message 32] Jamie: Good luck with that, Alex! You'll have to show us when it's done.
[Message 33] Alex: Will do! What kind of painting have you been up to lately, Riley?
[Message 34] Riley: Landscapes, mostly. Trying to capture the autumn colors before they're all gone.
[Message 35] Jordan: Nashville in the fall is beautiful. Even when the market's down, the scenery's up.
[Message 36] Jamie: Very true! Okay, I should probably head back inside. My lunch break is almost over.

[Message 5] Maya: Absolutely! I’ve been counting down the days. Think they’ll pull out a win?
[Message 6] Alex: Depends on their defense, I think. Last few games have been a bit shaky.
[Message 7] Liam: Agreed, Alex. Defense needs to step up. What about offense, Maya? Optimistic?
[Message 8] Maya: Always! Taylor’s been looking good, and the receivers are decent. I have faith!
[Message 9] Alex: Speaking of faith, did you guys see that article about the Special Olympics coming to Indianapolis again?
[Message 10] Liam: No, I missed that, Alex. That's awesome!
[Message 11] Maya: Oh, that’s great! Indy does a good job hosting.
[Message 12] Liam: Totally. Okay, back to the Colts… anyone got any bold predictions for Sunday?
[Message 13] Maya: Taylor scores twice! Book it!

[Message 16] Maya: Ooh, I like the drama, Liam!
[Message 17] Alex: Anyone thinking about travel lately? Trying to decide where to go next.
[Message 18] Liam: I've been itching to go back to Italy. Florence was amazing.

[Message 43] Maya: Oh, cool! What's it of?
[Message 44] Liam: It's abstract, so it's hard to describe. Let's just say it involves a lot of twisted metal.
[Message 45] Alex: Sounds intense!
[Message 46] Maya: I'm working on a big project at work, so that's consuming most of my energy.
[Message 47] Alex: What kind of project? If you can say, of course.
[Message 48] Maya: It's a new system implementation for our supply chain. Pretty exciting stuff. (For a project manager, anyway!)
[Message 49] Liam: Sounds like a challenge!
[Message 50] Alex: I'm trying to finish binge-watching this show on Netflix. Almost there!

[Message 83] Alex: So, any other sports plans for the weekend besides the Colts game?
[Message 84] Liam: Not really. Just gonna relax and maybe catch some highlights of other games.
[Message 85] Alex: Same here. Probably just the Colts game for me.
[Message 86] Liam: Alright, well, I should probably get back to sculpting before it gets too late.
[Message 87] Alex: Sounds good! Have fun with that.
[Message 88] Liam: Thanks! Talk to you later.
[Message 89] Alex: Later! Go Colts!
[Message 90] Liam: Go Colts!
[Message 91] Alex: Oh, one more thing...anyone know of any good coffee shops near the nursing home?
[Message 92] Liam: There's a Starbucks a few blocks away.
[Message 93] Alex: Perfect! Thanks.

170,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone, ready to dive into chapter 3 of ""Sapiens""?
[Message 2] Jordan: Yup! Just finished re-reading it. So much to unpack.
[Message 3] Casey: Almost ready. Just grabbing my coffee. Be right back.
[Message 4] Alex: No worries, Casey. We'll wait. Jordan, what were your initial thoughts?
[Message 5] Jordan: I was struck by the discussion on the Agricultural Revolution. Such a double-edged sword.
[Message 6] Alex: Totally agree. It's presented as progress, but at what cost?
[Message 7] Casey: Okay, I'm back! Coffee in hand and ready to go.
[Message 8] Casey: Agricultural Revolution, huh? Interesting. I always thought it was a definite step forward.
[Message 9] Jordan: ""Sapiens"" makes a compelling argument against that simplistic view.
[Message 10] Alex: Yeah, the book really highlights the decrease in dietary variety and increased workload for early farmers.
[Message 11] Casey: Huh. I never thought about that. I guess I just assumed more food meant better lives.
[Message 12] Jordan: Exactly! It's a much more nuanced story than we usually hear.
[Message 13] Alex: So, question for you both: do you think we're still feeling the effects of that shift today?
[Message 14] Jordan: Absolutely. Our entire societal structure is built upon agricultural surplus.
[Message 15] Casey: Makes sense. I'm starting to see it. It's crazy how much our lives are shaped by something that happened so long ago.
[Message 16] Alex: Right? What about the section on imagined realities? That blew my mind.
[Message 17] Jordan: Oh man, the imagined realities! That's where the book really gets philosophical.
[Message 18] Casey: Imagined realities? Can someone refresh my memory?
[Message 19] Alex: It's the idea that things like corporations, money, and even human rights are all constructs we've collectively agreed to believe in.
[Message 20] Jordan: Pretty wild, right? It means our entire world is built on shared fictions.
[Message 21] Casey: Wow. That's... a lot to take in. Okay, I'm officially intrigued.
[Message 22] Alex: I know, right? It makes you question everything.
[Message 23] Jordan: Especially how power is wielded and maintained through these systems.
[Message 24] Casey: So, are we saying that our entire system of education is also part of these ""imagined realities""?
[Message 25] Alex: That's an interesting question. I think so, to some extent. The value we place on degrees, for example.
[Message 26] Jordan: Definitely. Education is a constructed system with its own rules and hierarchies.
[Message 27] Casey: And we're all actively participating in it right now!
[Message 28] Alex: Exactly! Which is kind of meta, when you think about it.
[Message 29] Jordan: So, shifting gears slightly, did either of you see that cool exhibit at the Getty recently?
[Message 30] Casey: No, what exhibit are you talking about, Jordan?
[Message 31] Jordan: It's a photography exhibit on early California landscapes. Really stunning.
[Message 32] Alex: Oh, I've been meaning to go! Is it still running?
[Message 33] Jordan: I think it's up for another two weeks. You should definitely check it out, Alex.
[Message 34] Alex: I will! Thanks for the reminder. Back to ""Sapiens"" – what did you think about the chapter's ending?
[Message 35] Casey: I'm still digesting the imagined realities part, honestly. Give me a minute.
[Message 36] Jordan: The ending felt a little pessimistic, didn't it? About the future of humanity?
[Message 37] Alex: Yeah, a bit. But also realistic, I think.
[Message 38] Casey: Okay, I'm back! The ending... it was definitely thought-provoking.
[Message 39] Jordan: What struck you the most, Casey?
[Message 40] Casey: Just the sheer scale of our impact on the planet. It's kind of overwhelming.
[Message 41] Alex: Agreed. It's hard to reconcile our accomplishments with the environmental consequences.
[Message 42] Jordan: It makes you wonder what the next stage of our evolution will be.
[Message 43] Casey: Hopefully, one where we're a little more mindful of our surroundings.
[Message 44] Alex: Hear, hear!
[Message 45] Jordan: So, what are we tackling next week? Chapter 4?
[Message 46] Alex: Yep! Chapter 4. ""The Flood."" Sounds ominous.
[Message 47] Casey: Maybe I should get a head start this time.
[Message 48] Jordan: Good plan! It's a dense one.
[Message 49] Alex: Before we wrap up, anyone want to grab some pizza after this?
[Message 50] Jordan: I'm in! Pizza sounds amazing.
[Message 51] Casey: I'm game too. I'm starving.
[Message 52] Alex: Awesome! Let's aim to finish up in an hour or so?
[Message 53] Jordan: Sounds good. Time to power through this chapter!
[Message 54] Casey: Agreed. Let's do this!
[Message 55] Alex: Okay, back to the book. What about the section on the unification of humankind?
[Message 56] Jordan: That was fascinating. The idea that cultures are constantly evolving and merging.
[Message 57] Casey: It's true. Everything is always changing.
[Message 58] Alex: Do you think we're heading towards a more homogenous global culture?
[Message 59] Jordan: Possibly. But I think local cultures will always find a way to adapt and survive.
[Message 60] Casey: I hope so. I think diversity is important.
[Message 61] Alex: Agreed. It's what makes the world interesting.
[Message 62] Jordan: So, I was reading about this new AI development… completely unrelated, but fascinating.
[Message 63] Casey: Oh? Tell me more, Jordan!
[Message 64] Alex: Is it one of those AI art generators? I've been seeing those everywhere.
[Message 65] Jordan: Something like that, but it's geared toward analyzing complex data sets and predicting trends.
[Message 66] Casey: Wow, that's pretty cool. Could it predict the future of education, maybe?
[Message 67] Jordan: Haha, maybe! We should feed it ""Sapiens"" and see what it says.
[Message 68] Alex: That would be amazing! Okay, let's focus. Back to unification...
[Message 69] Casey: Back to unification it is! My brain is starting to hurt.
[Message 70] Jordan: Alright, let's wrap this up and get some pizza! My treat.",0,

[Message 2] Jamie: Hi Evelyn! I am! And yes, I've been eyeing the Artsplosure festival downtown. It's usually fantastic.
[Message 3] Casey: Artsplosure is great! I went last year and got some really cool prints.
[Message 4] Alex: Hey all! I'm good, thanks. Festivals? Hmm, I'm more of a stay-at-home type, but I’m always up for trying new food at the restaurants downtown.
[Message 5] Evelyn: That's fair, Alex! There are some excellent new restaurants opening up. Have you tried the new Thai place on Glenwood?
[Message 6] Alex: Not yet, Evelyn! Is it good? What do you recommend?
[Message 7] Jamie: The Pad See Ew is amazing at that Thai place, Alex. Definitely try it!
[Message 8] Casey: I second that! Pad See Ew is always a winner.
[Message 9] Evelyn: I'm partial to the Green Curry myself. So fragrant!
[Message 10] Casey: Speaking of fragrant, are those your roses, Alex? They smell lovely.
[Message 11] Alex: Thanks, Casey! They are. Just started blooming.
[Message 12] Jamie: You have a green thumb, Alex! I'm jealous.
[Message 13] Alex: Just a lot of patience, Jamie. And maybe a little luck.
[Message 14] Evelyn: So, back to festivals – any interest in the Hopscotch Music Festival?
[Message 15] Jamie: Hopscotch is usually pretty good, though it can get a bit crowded for my taste.
[Message 16] Casey: I went to Hopscotch a few years ago. Some really good bands play.
[Message 17] Alex: Music festivals aren't really my thing, but I appreciate the energy. I do like the smaller, community garden festivals more.
[Message 18] Evelyn: I didn't even know there were community garden festivals!
[Message 19] Alex: Oh yeah! Usually in the spring. Plant sales, workshops, that kind of thing.
[Message 20] Jamie: That sounds lovely, Alex. I should look into those.
[Message 21] Casey: Me too!
[Message 22] Evelyn: Maybe we can all go to one together!
[Message 23] Jamie: I'd be up for that!
[Message 24] Casey: Count me in!
[Message 25] Alex: Sounds good! I can keep an eye out for announcements.
[Message 26] Evelyn: Wonderful! You’re the gardening expert, Alex.
[Message 27] Jamie: Speaking of experts, Evelyn, how's your investing going? Any good tips?
[Message 28] Evelyn: Oh, it's always a learning process, Jamie. Diversification is key, as always!
[Message 29] Casey: I should probably start investing at some point...
[Message 30] Jamie: It's never too late, Casey!
[Message 31] Alex: My brother's always telling me to invest. I just don't know where to start.
[Message 32] Evelyn: There are tons of resources online, Alex. Or you could talk to a financial advisor.
[Message 33] Jamie: True! Knowledge is power when it comes to investing.
[Message 34] Casey: I’m just trying to save up for a down payment on a house first.
[Message 35] Alex: That's a big goal! Good luck, Casey.
[Message 36] Jamie: It is! But totally worth it.
[Message 37] Evelyn: Absolutely, Casey! Homeownership is a great feeling.
[Message 38] Evelyn: Has anyone been to the State Fair recently?
[Message 39] Jamie: Not recently, Evelyn, but I do enjoy the food!
[Message 40] Casey: I went last year. It was fun, but super crowded.
[Message 41] Alex: I haven't been to the State Fair in years. Too many people for me.
[Message 42] Evelyn: I understand. It can be overwhelming. I do love the crafts though.
[Message 43] Jamie: The crafts are great! And the prize-winning vegetables!
[Message 44] Casey: Yes! The giant pumpkins are always impressive.
[Message 45] Alex: Okay, now I'm tempted to go just to see the giant pumpkins.
[Message 46] Evelyn: You should! It's a real spectacle.
[Message 47] Jamie: Maybe we should all go together sometime?
[Message 48] Casey: That could be fun!
[Message 49] Alex: I'm in, just for the pumpkins.
[Message 50] Evelyn: Excellent! We'll have to coordinate.
[Message 51] Jamie: I'm thinking of making a big batch of chili this weekend. Anyone interested in coming over?
[Message 52] Casey: Chili sounds amazing, Jamie! I’d love to.
[Message 53] Alex: I'm in! I can bring some cornbread.
[Message 54] Evelyn: That sounds wonderful, Jamie! I'm unfortunately busy this weekend, but have fun!
[Message 55] Jamie: Aww, too bad, Evelyn! Maybe next time.
[Message 56] Casey: Cornbread sounds perfect, Alex!
[Message 57] Alex: I have a really good recipe.
[Message 58] Jamie: I'm excited to try it!
[Message 59] Casey: Me too!
[Message 60] Evelyn: You're all making me hungry!
[Message 61] Jamie: We'll save you some chili, Evelyn!
[Message 62] Evelyn: Thank you, Jamie!
[Message 63] Casey: So, Alex, what kind of gardening projects are you working on right now?
[Message 64] Alex: I'm trying to get my tomatoes to actually ripen this year. They're taking forever.
[Message 65] Jamie: I feel your pain! My tomatoes are the same.
[Message 66] Casey: Any tips for tomato ripening, Alex?
[Message 67] Alex: I've heard that pinching off some of the lower leaves can help.
[Message 68] Jamie: I'll try that! Thanks, Alex.
[Message 69] Evelyn: Interesting! I might have to try that with my friend's tomato plants.
[Message 70] Casey: I’m also trying to attract more pollinators to my garden.
[Message 71] Alex: Planting bee-friendly flowers is the best way to do that!
[Message 72] Jamie: What kind of bee-friendly flowers do you recommend?
[Message 73] Alex: Lavender, sunflowers, coneflowers, and borage are all good choices.
[Message 74] Casey: Thanks! I’ll look into those.
[Message 75] Evelyn: I love lavender!
[Message 76] Jamie: Me too! The scent is so relaxing.
[Message 77] Casey: Has anyone seen any good movies lately?
[Message 78] Alex: I watched a documentary about mushrooms last week. It was surprisingly interesting.
[Message 79] Jamie: Mushrooms? Really? What was it about?
[Message 80] Alex: All sorts of things! Their role in ecosystems, medicinal uses, psychedelic properties…
[Message 81] Evelyn: That sounds fascinating!
[Message 82] Casey: I saw the new action movie last week. It was pretty good.
[Message 83] Jamie: I'm not a big fan of action movies, but I do enjoy a good documentary.
[Message 84] Evelyn: I prefer historical dramas myself.
[Message 85] Alex: To each their own!
[Message 86] Jamie: Exactly! That's what makes life interesting.
[Message 87] Casey: True!
[Message 88] Evelyn: Absolutely!
[Message 89] Casey: I think I'm going to grab another sandwich. Anyone want anything from the picnic basket?
[Message 90] Jamie: I'm good, thanks!
[Message 91] Alex: Me too, thanks.
[Message 92] Evelyn: I'll take a cookie, if there are any left!
[Message 93] Casey: Yep! Plenty of cookies. Coming right up!
[Message 94] Jamie: This picnic is lovely. Thanks for organizing it, Evelyn!
[Message 95] Evelyn: You're very welcome, Jamie! It's been great catching up with everyone.
[Message 96] Casey: Agreed!
[Message 97] Alex: Definitely. Good to see you all.
[Message 98] Jamie: Have you guys seen the new library downtown? It’s gorgeous.
[Message 99] Casey: I haven't! I need to check it out.
[Message 100] Alex: I haven't either. Libraries aren't really my thing, but I should probably visit sometime.
[Message 101] Evelyn: I've heard it's beautiful. They have a wonderful reading room.
[Message 102] Jamie: They do! And a great selection of books, of course.
[Message 103] Casey: I'll have to make a trip soon.
[Message 104] Alex: Maybe I'll join you, Casey.
[Message 105] Casey: That would be great, Alex!
[Message 106] Evelyn: Perhaps we could all go together sometime?
[Message 107] Jamie: That would be fun! A library outing!
[Message 108] Casey: Count me in!
[Message 109] Alex: Okay, okay, I'm in too.
[Message 110] Evelyn: Wonderful!
[Message 111] Jamie: It's supposed to rain tomorrow. Any good indoor activity recommendations?
[Message 112] Casey: Board game night?
[Message 113] Alex: I'm terrible at board games.
[Message 114] Evelyn: A museum visit?
[Message 115] Jamie: Ooh, good idea, Evelyn!
[Message 116] Casey: There's a new exhibit at the art museum.
[Message 117] Alex: Okay, I could do a museum.
[Message 118] Evelyn: Excellent! We're full of ideas today.
[Message 119] Jamie: We are!
[Message 120] Casey: Definitely!
[Message 121] Alex: So, museum tomorrow then? Assuming it rains.
[Message 122] Jamie: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 123] Casey: Perfect!
[Message 124] Evelyn: Enjoy! I won't be able to make it.
[Message 125] Jamie: No worries, Evelyn!
[Message 126] Casey: We'll tell you all about it!
[Message 127] Alex: Yeah, we'll bring back a postcard or something.
[Message 128] Evelyn: That would be lovely! Thank you!
[Message 129] Jamie: What kind of art are you hoping to see, Casey?
[Message 130] Casey: I'm always a fan of impressionism.
[Message 131] Alex: I don't really know much about art. I just kind of wander around and look at things.
[Message 132] Jamie: That's a perfectly valid approach, Alex!
[Message 133] Evelyn: Indeed! Art is subjective.
[Message 134] Casey: Exactly!
[Message 135] Alex: True. Maybe I'll learn something tomorrow.
[Message 136] Jamie: You never know!
[Message 137] Casey: It's always good to broaden your horizons.
[Message 138] Evelyn: I agree wholeheartedly!
[Message 139] Jamie: Well, this has been a wonderful afternoon. Thanks again, Evelyn!
[Message 140] Casey: Yes, thank you!
[Message 141] Alex: Thanks, Evelyn!
[Message 142] Evelyn: My pleasure, everyone! It was lovely seeing you all.
[Message 143] Jamie: I should probably head out soon. Gotta get ready for that chili cook-off!
[Message 144] Casey: Have fun! I'm looking forward to it!
[Message 145] Alex: See you tomorrow, Jamie!
[Message 146] Evelyn: Good luck with the chili, Jamie!
[Message 147] Jamie: Thanks, everyone! See you all soon!
[Message 148] Casey: I'm going to start packing up my things as well.
[Message 149] Alex: Me too. It's getting a little cooler.
[Message 150] Evelyn: Yes, the sun is starting to go down.
[Message 151] Casey: It was a perfect day for a picnic though.
[Message 152] Alex: Definitely.
[Message 153] Evelyn: Absolutely.
[Message 154] Casey: Well, I'm off! See you all soon!
[Message 155] Alex: Bye, Casey!
[Message 156] Evelyn: Goodbye, Casey!
[Message 157] Casey: Bye Evelyn, Bye Alex!
[Message 158] Alex: I think I'll get going too. Evelyn, do you need help packing anything up?
[Message 159] Evelyn: That's very kind of you, Alex, but I think I can manage. Thank you though!
[Message 160] Alex: Alright. Well, see you around!
[Message 161] Evelyn: Goodbye, Alex! Drive safely!
[Message 162] Alex: You too, Evelyn!
[Message 163] Evelyn: I think I’ll stay for a little while longer and enjoy the peace and quiet.
[Message 164] Evelyn: It was lovely chatting about Festivals and everything else with everyone!
[Message 165] Evelyn: I am already excited for our next get together!
[Message 166] Evelyn: Perhaps we can try that new restaurant next time.
[Message 167] Evelyn: I hear they have great lunch specials.

[Message 2] Fatima: Yeah, crazy. Old Mrs. Davies, right? The security guard?
[Message 3] Omar: Yeah, terrible.
[Message 4] Fatima: Poor woman. What happened exactly?
[Message 5] Omar: Word is, some kind of poisoning.
[Message 6] Fatima: Poisoning? At the Mosque? Who would do that?
[Message 7] Omar: No clue. The cops are all over it.
[Message 8] Fatima: I saw them hauling someone out earlier. Looked young.
[Message 9] Omar: Really? Who?
[Message 10] Fatima: Couldn't tell. Covered their face. Heard it might be Kai.
[Message 11] Omar: Kai? Seriously? That doesn't sound right.
[Message 12] Fatima: I know, right? Seemed quiet. But they did have that argument with Mrs. Davies last week.
[Message 13] Omar: About what?
[Message 14] Fatima: Something about fundraising for the new community center. Mrs. Davies wasn't happy with how Kai was handling it.
[Message 15] Omar: Still, murder? Seems extreme.
[Message 16] Fatima: Agreed. Maybe it's a mistake.
[Message 17] Omar: Hope so. Anyway, you still coming to dinner tomorrow?
[Message 18] Fatima: Yeah, wouldn't miss it. Need a distraction after all this.

[Message 26] Kai: That Mrs. Davies is dead. They think I did it.
[Message 27] Ahmed: What? How? Why would they think that?
[Message 28] Kai: Something about poison. I swear I didn't do anything.
[Message 29] Ahmed: Where were you last night?
[Message 30] Kai: At home! Playing video games! You know I always do that on Wednesdays.
[Message 31] Ahmed: Did anyone see you?
[Message 32] Kai: No. I was alone. Crap.
[Message 33] Ahmed: Okay, don't panic. Get a lawyer.
[Message 34] Kai: I can't afford one.
[Message 35] Ahmed: I'll help you find someone pro bono. Just tell them everything.
[Message 36] Kai: I will. Thanks, Ahmed. I'm so scared.
[Message 37] Ahmed: It'll be okay. We'll figure this out. Remember that time we got blamed for toilet papering Mrs. Henderson's house? This is worse, but same principle.
[Message 38] Kai: This isn't the same, Ahmed! This is MURDER.
[Message 39] Ahmed: I know, I know. Just trying to lighten the mood. I'm on my way. Don't say anything else to the cops.
[Message 40] Kai: Okay. Hurry.
[Message 41] Layla: Heard about Mrs. Davies. Tragic.
[Message 42] David: Yeah, awful. Such a sweet lady.
[Message 43] Layla: Did you see Kai was arrested?
[Message 44] David: I did. Seems… unlikely. But they did argue.
[Message 45] Layla: Everyone argues sometimes. Doesn't make you a murderer.
[Message 46] David: True. Did you see anything unusual last night?
[Message 47] Layla: Nope. I was home all night, binge-watching that true crime show. How ironic.
[Message 48] David: Haha. Me too, actually. Which one?
[Message 49] Layla: ""Night Stalker."" So creepy.
[Message 50] David: Good choice. Hey, this is going to sound weird, but did you ever see Kai acting strangely around Mrs. Davies? Maybe a little *too* helpful?
[Message 51] Layla: Now that you mention it, they did bring her tea every afternoon. Maybe they intended to get rid of her.
[Message 52] David: Maybe. Just trying to piece things together. Something feels off.
[Message 53] Layla: I understand. Keep me posted.
[Message 54] David: Will do.
[Message 55] Omar: Hey, any updates on the Davies case?
[Message 56] Fatima: Just that Kai is still in custody. Apparently, they found traces of some kind of poison in their apartment.
[Message 57] Omar: Seriously? That's… damning.
[Message 58] Fatima: Yeah. Looks bad.
[Message 59] Omar: I still find it hard to believe.
[Message 60] Fatima: Me too. But the evidence is mounting.
[Message 61] Omar: Maybe they were framed?
[Message 62] Fatima: Possible, but who would do that?
[Message 63] Omar: No idea. It's all so messed up. Hey, did you hear back from the landlord about the broken faucet?
[Message 64] Fatima: Ugh, not yet. I'm going to call them again tomorrow.
[Message 65] Omar: Annoying. I can take a look at it if you want.
[Message 66] Fatima: You're a lifesaver! I'll take you up on that.
[Message 67] Omar: Anytime.
[Message 68] Kai: They think I planned this!
[Message 69] Ahmed: Relax, Kai. They have to prove it.
[Message 70] Kai: But what if they can't? What if they just want someone to blame? I heard the punishment is life in prison.
[Message 71] Ahmed: Don't think like that. The lawyer said we have a strong alibi case. Playing video games all night isn't exactly suspicious.
[Message 72] Kai: But they found poison in my apartment! I don't even know where it came from!
[Message 73] Ahmed: Someone could have planted it. We'll figure it out. Did you mention to the police that Mrs. Davies provoked you by shouting at you and calling you names?
[Message 74] Kai: No, should I have? I was too freaked out.
[Message 75] Ahmed: Yes! It shows she was aggressive. Maybe she had a heart attack after the argument!
[Message 76] Kai: Oh god, what if she did? And I didn't call 911?
[Message 77] Ahmed: That's not your fault! You didn't know she was dying.
[Message 78] Kai: This is a nightmare.
[Message 79] Ahmed: We'll get through it.
[Message 80] David: Hey Layla, something's bugging me.
[Message 81] Layla: What's that?
[Message 82] David: Remember you said you were watching ""Night Stalker""?
[Message 83] Layla: Yeah?
[Message 84] David: That's weird. The internet was down all night. How could you stream it?
[Message 85] Layla: Oh... I meant, I had it downloaded already. From before.
[Message 86] David: Right. Sure.
[Message 87] Layla: What are you implying?
[Message 88] David: Nothing. Just seems odd. You knew Mrs. Davies pretty well, right?
[Message 89] Layla: We chatted sometimes. She was nice. But I didn't *know* her.
[Message 90] David: She mentioned you were having financial problems recently.
[Message 91] Layla: That's none of her business.
[Message 92] David: Did she offer to help?
[Message 93] Layla: Maybe. What's your point?
[Message 94] David: Just trying to understand why someone might want her gone. And why they might buy Poisoning via inhalation at the store.
[Message 95] Layla: I think you are wrong.
[Message 96] Omar: So, did you fix the faucet?
[Message 97] Fatima: Yeah, thanks to you! Working perfectly now.
[Message 98] Omar: Great! Glad I could help. Anything else I can do?
[Message 99] Fatima: Maybe… do you know anything about making homemade cleaners?
[Message 100] Omar: A little. Why?
[Message 101] Fatima: Just curious. Trying to be more eco-friendly.
[Message 102] Omar: There are tons of recipes online. Be careful mixing chemicals, though.
[Message 103] Fatima: I will be. Thanks for the tip.
[Message 104] Omar: No problem. Hey, I'm heading to the Mosque tomorrow. Wanna come?
[Message 105] Fatima: I appreciate the invite but can't make it. I need to run errands.
[Message 106] Omar: Okay, another time.
[Message 107] Fatima: Definitely.
[Message 108] Ahmed: I'm telling you, Kai, Layla has a motive. Financial trouble, and she knew Mrs. Davies.
[Message 109] Kai: But why would she plant poison in *my* apartment?
[Message 110] Ahmed: To make it look like you did it! She knew you had a disagreement with Mrs. Davies. It's the perfect setup. Think about it – she was talking about hurting her right before she went over there and brought her tea every afternoon.",1,

[Message 6] Alex: I'm in the mood for the salad. Trying to be healthy, haha.
[Message 7] River: Salad sounds good. I'll join you.
[Message 8] Jordan: I'll go with the burger too. Comfort food.
[Message 9] Liam: So, River, how was that job interview you mentioned last week?
[Message 10] River: Oh, right! It went... okay. I think.
[Message 11] Alex: Okay? Spill the tea!
[Message 12] River: Well, the interviewers seemed nice, but the position sounds a little more demanding than I initially thought.
[Message 13] Jordan: Demanding how?
[Message 14] River: Longer hours, more responsibility. Good pay, though.
[Message 15] Liam: High pay usually comes with high demands, unfortunately.
[Message 16] Alex: True. But sometimes it's worth it if you like the work itself.
[Message 17] River: That's what I'm trying to figure out. The work seems interesting, just... a lot.
[Message 18] Jordan: Weigh the pros and cons. Make a list. That's what I do.
[Message 19] Liam: Good advice, Jordan. What about your family, River? What do they think?
[Message 20] River: They're supportive, but my mom wants me to take it just for the security.
[Message 21] Alex: Moms always want that! Mine too.
[Message 22] River: Exactly! But I want to be happy, not just secure.
[Message 23] Jordan: Happiness is important. Security helps, but doesn't guarantee it.
[Message 24] Liam: What are you passionate about, River?
[Message 25] River: I really enjoy creative writing, actually. This job isn't in that field at all.
[Message 26] Alex: Maybe you could find a way to incorporate that into your life, even if this job isn't ideal?
[Message 27] River: That's a good point, Alex. Side hustle, maybe?
[Message 28] Jordan: Plenty of people do that now.

[Message 36] Liam: All sorts! Classical, jazz, even some old rock and roll.

[Message 5] Ben: Building… right. So, the education initiative? Still on track?
[Message 6] Sarah: That's the plan.
[Message 7] Mark: The *announced* plan.

[Message 18] Sarah: Officially.
[Message 19] Mark: Officially-ish.

[Message 21] Ben: The documents are compromised.
[Message 22] Sarah: Compromised how?
[Message 23] Mark: Let's just say they've seen… the light of day.
[Message 24] Linda: Meaning?
[Message 25] Ben: Someone… saw them. Who shouldn't have.
[Message 26] Sarah: Did they see *everything*?

[Message 57] Ben: Risking… nothing. We’re just being cautious.
[Message 58] Sarah: Cautious is a luxury we can’t afford.
[Message 59] Mark: Agreed. We need… action.

[Message 61] Ben: Let’s just try and keep everything under wraps for now.

[Message 64] Linda: I don’t like genies or bottles.
[Message 65] Ben: Does anyone know who… saw them?
[Message 66] Sarah: Suspects, maybe. Proof, no.
[Message 67] Mark: Proof is for… courts. We're not in court.
[Message 68] Linda: I really don’t like this.
[Message 69] Ben: Then maybe you should leave.

[Message 2] David: Hey Sarah! Yeah, all set up. Just enjoying the peace and quiet. Ready for some storytelling?

[Message 3] Sarah: Absolutely! I've got a good one about my cat's escapades. You go first though, Mr. Experienced Truck Driver.

[Message 4] David: Haha! Experienced, yes. Funny stories related to trucking…hmm. Let me think. Okay, I got one. You won't believe this...

[Message 5] David: So, I was hauling a load of watermelons down to Tucson a few years back, right?

[Message 6] Sarah: Watermelons! I can already sense this is going to be good. Go on...

[Message 7] David: About halfway there, I hear this THUMP from the back. Then another. I'm thinking, ""What in the world is going on back there?""

[Message 8] Sarah: Oh no! My imagination is running wild already.

[Message 9] David: So I pull over, expecting to find a flat tire or something. I go around to the back, and there's this HUGE watermelon, split right open...

[Message 10] Sarah: Aww man!

[Message 11] David: ...and about 20 birds are having a FEAST. They were pecking away at the juicy insides like they hadn't eaten in weeks.

[Message 12] Sarah: (Laughing) No way! They were having a watermelon party!

[Message 13] David: I swear, Sarah. It was the most ridiculous thing I'd ever seen. Had to shoo them away and salvage what I could. Lost a good chunk of the load that day.

[Message 14] Sarah: That's amazing! The audacity of those birds! Okay, my turn. This one's about Mittens, my cat.

[Message 15] David: Mittens, the terror of the neighborhood, right? I remember you mentioning her.

[Message 16] Sarah: She's a character, alright. So, I bought this fancy cat tree for her… the kind with all the levels and scratching posts.

[Message 17] David: The whole shebang.

[Message 18] Sarah: Exactly! I set it up in the living room, expecting her to be thrilled. She took one look at it...

[Message 19] David: …and?

[Message 20] Sarah: …and decided it was the perfect place to store her favorite toy mouse. ON THE VERY TOP LEVEL.

[Message 21] David: (Chuckles) Of course she did. Queen of the castle.

[Message 22] Sarah: But getting the mouse UP there was the funny part. She'd grab it, jump halfway, lose her grip, chase it down, and start all over again. It took her like, half an hour.

[Message 23] David: Persistent little thing.

[Message 24] Sarah: The whole time she's making these little frustrated meows. It was the most ungraceful, hilarious thing I've ever seen. All that money on a fancy cat tree, and she just uses it for storage!

[Message 25] David: Cats, man. They’re something else. Speaking of… Did you see what Brenda did with the customer feedback reports?

[Message 26] Sarah: Oh, you're changing the subject? I think I noticed some issues.

[Message 27] David: Well, yeah. It's a little… scattered, isn't it? How would you phrase it to her nicely? She’s sensitive.

[Message 28] Sarah: Hmm, I think focusing on the positive and then suggesting a more structured approach would work. Maybe suggest a specific template she could use?

[Message 29] David: Good idea. I'll give that a shot. Thanks, Sarah. Back to funny stories…you got another one?

[Message 30] Sarah: Sure! This one time, I was playing a video game…

[Message 31] David: Oh, what game? You into those RPGs?

[Message 32] Sarah: I am! This was Skyrim, actually. I was sneaking through a dungeon, trying to avoid a troll...

[Message 33] David: Trolls are nasty in that game!

[Message 34] Sarah: Tell me about it! Anyway, I accidentally bumped into a table, which sent a bunch of pots and pans clattering to the floor.

[Message 35] David: In the game?

[Message 36] Sarah: Yes! But my cat, Mittens, was asleep on my lap. The sudden noise startled her so badly, she jumped straight up and scratched my face!

[Message 37] David: (Laughing) Oh, the irony! You got trolled by your own cat!

[Message 38] Sarah: I know, right? I couldn't even be mad, it was so perfectly timed.

[Message 39] David: That’s a classic. My turn. This is a little off-topic, but kinda funny in hindsight. Remember that time I tried to learn to knit?

[Message 40] Sarah: Knit?! You, David, the truck driver, tried to knit? I need details!

[Message 41] David: My granddaughter was teaching me. She said it was relaxing.

[Message 42] Sarah: And was it?

[Message 43] David: Relaxing? No. Frustrating. I kept dropping stitches, tangling the yarn... it looked like a bird had tried to build a nest out of wool.

[Message 44] Sarah: (Laughing harder) I can just picture it!

[Message 45] David: After an hour, I had maybe two inches of something that vaguely resembled a scarf. My granddaughter just politely took the needles back. Said maybe I should stick to driving.

[Message 46] Sarah: That's hilarious! Some things just aren't meant to be, I guess. My turn again!

[Message 47] Sarah: So, I was at the grocery store the other day...

[Message 48] David: Let me guess, Mittens got loose in the produce aisle?

[Message 49] Sarah: (Laughing) No, but that's a great idea for another story! No, this involved a self-checkout line.

[Message 50] David: Oh boy...self-checkout. The bane of my existence.

[Message 51] Sarah: I was trying to scan a bag of apples, but the scanner just wouldn't read it. I tried everything – different angles, cleaning the barcode...nothing.

[Message 52] David: Been there.

[Message 53] Sarah: Finally, I got so frustrated that I yelled, ""JUST TAKE MY MONEY, YOU STUPID MACHINE!""

[Message 54] David: (Bursts out laughing) And what happened?

[Message 55] Sarah: Everyone in line stared at me. The machine, of course, remained unimpressed. Eventually, a store employee had to come over and manually enter the code.

[Message 56] David: Priceless. You're a legend, Sarah.

[Message 57] Sarah: I try! Haha! Okay, okay… One last story before we call it a night?

[Message 58] David: Alright, make it a good one! My turn this time, though. It involves my attempts at investing…

[Message 59] Sarah: Uh oh… This sounds interesting.

[Message 60] David: I thought I was being clever. I saw some stock in a company going way up and figured I'd get in on the ground floor. Jumped right in without doing much research.

[Message 61] Sarah: (Wincing) Not a good sign.

[Message 62] David: Nope. The very next day, the stock tanked. Turns out the company was about to be investigated for fraud.

[Message 63] Sarah: Ouch! That's rough.

[Message 64] David: I lost a decent chunk of change. Lesson learned: Do your homework! Now I stick to safer investments.

[Message 65] Sarah: Wise choice! Alright, my last one is pretty short. I tried to bake bread once...

[Message 66] David: And?

[Message 67] Sarah: It came out looking like a hockey puck. Dense, hard, and completely inedible.

[Message 68] David: (Laughing) Well, you can’t win them all.

[Message 69] Sarah: Exactly! That's all I got. Thanks for the stories, David. That was fun.

[Message 70] David: Anytime, Sarah! Good night. Sleep well. And watch out for those watermelon-loving birds!",0,

[Message 5] Dale: Lonely? You always were a free spirit. Never struck me as someone needing a relationship.
[Message 6] Martha: Free spirit doesn't mean immune to loneliness, Dale. Everyone needs connection. What about you? Any special someone?
[Message 7] Dale: Nah. Relationships are a young person’s game. Too much hassle. Just leads to disappointment.
[Message 8] Martha: Ouch, Dale! Still the pessimist, I see. That's a pretty bleak outlook.
[Message 9] Dale: Realistic. I prefer to call it realistic. Seen too much go wrong.
[Message 10] Martha: But haven’t you seen good relationships too? My parents were together for 60 years!
[Message 11] Dale: Exceptions prove the rule. And even they had their arguments, I bet.
[Message 12] Martha: Of course they did! But they worked through them. That’s the point. Compromise.
[Message 13] Dale: Compromise? Sounds like giving up.
[Message 14] Martha: No, it’s about understanding. Respect. Seeing the other person's perspective. Speaking of perspective, did you see that new fashion exhibit downtown?
[Message 15] Dale: Fashion exhibit? You know I'm a sucker for a good suit. What kind of exhibit?
[Message 16] Martha: It’s vintage! Clothes from the 50s and 60s. Really cool stuff. Might cheer you up!
[Message 17] Dale: Maybe. But I doubt it'll change my mind about relationships.
[Message 18] Martha: Never know! Anyway, back to relationships... Don't you think finding someone who shares your interests is key?
[Message 19] Dale: Interests? What, so we can both watch golf on TV in silence?
[Message 20] Martha: Haha! No! Sharing hobbies, passions. Something that brings you together. Like dancing!
[Message 21] Dale: Dancing? I have two left feet.
[Message 22] Martha: Doesn't matter! It’s about having fun, being silly. Laughter is important.
[Message 23] Dale: I haven’t laughed in… well, I can’t remember the last time I laughed.
[Message 24] Martha: See? You need a relationship! Someone to make you laugh.
[Message 25] Dale: Or just a good joke.
[Message 26] Martha: I'm serious! Think about it. Having someone to share your life with. Someone to talk to.
[Message 27] Dale: I have my cat, Mittens. She’s a good listener. Mostly sleeps, though.
[Message 28] Martha: Mittens is great, but she can't offer advice on, say, what to wear to that fashion exhibit.
[Message 29] Dale: Good point. I'm thinking a classic fedora. Never goes out of style.
[Message 30] Martha: A fedora! Love it! See, you’ve got style. You just need someone to appreciate it!
[Message 31] Dale: I appreciate my style. That’s enough for me.
[Message 32] Martha: You’re impossible, Dale! But I still love you. Like a grumpy old uncle.
[Message 33] Dale: I'm not that old! I'm only... eighty.
[Message 34] Martha: And I'm only eighty... seven! We're practically spring chickens.
[Message 35] Dale: Spring chickens with aching joints.
[Message 36] Martha: True. But back to my point, relationships can be fulfilling. It’s about finding the right person.
[Message 37] Dale: The ""right"" person. Easier said than done.
[Message 38] Martha: Everything worthwhile is hard, Dale. Worth the effort, though.
[Message 39] Dale: Maybe. I'll think about it. But don’t expect any miracles.
[Message 40] Martha: I don't. But I have faith in you, Dale. Even the grumpiest hearts can soften.
[Message 41] Dale: My heart is fine. It's just… guarded.
[Message 42] Martha: Guarded is fine. Just don't lock it up completely.
[Message 43] Dale: Okay, okay. Enough about relationships. What route are you taking on your next haul?
[Message 44] Martha: Thinking I'll head up through Flagstaff, then across to Denver. Beautiful scenery.
[Message 45] Dale: Be careful on those mountain roads. They can be treacherous.
[Message 46] Martha: Always am. Safety first. Say, that reminds me, have you tried that new diner down on Scottsdale Road? Heard they have great pie.
[Message 47] Dale: New diner? I'll have to check it out. I do love a good piece of pie. Apple, preferably.
[Message 48] Martha: Apple is classic! Well, Dale, it was great catching up. I have to run. Got a truck to load.
[Message 49] Dale: Good seeing you too, Martha. Safe travels. And maybe… just maybe… I’ll give the whole relationship thing some thought.
[Message 50] Martha: That’s all I ask! Take care, Dale! And wear that fedora to the diner!",0,

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, just tired. Long week. You heading to that new exhibit downtown?
[Message 3] Chloe: Thinking about it. Heard it's pretty cool. You going?
[Message 4] Liam: Maybe later. Got some errands. Did you hear what happened at the Synagogue?
[Message 5] Chloe: Yeah, awful. Poor Sarah.
[Message 6] Chloe: What do you think happened?
[Message 7] Liam: No idea. Crazy world. Hey, can you believe my car needs another repair?
[Message 8] Chloe: Ugh, cars. Tell me about it. Mine's making a weird noise.
[Message 9] Liam: Maybe get it checked out soon. So, that exhibit...worth it?
[Message 10] Chloe: Supposedly. Heard it’s all about local artists.
[Message 11] Liam: Cool. Maybe I’ll catch it next week.
[Message 12] Chloe: Sounds good. Anyway, gotta run. Catch you later.
[Message 13] Liam: Later, Chloe.
[Message 14] Maya: Liam, have you seen Ben lately? He's been avoiding my calls.
[Message 15] Liam: No, haven't seen him since that party last Saturday. Why?
[Message 16] Maya: Just worried. He seemed stressed about his job.
[Message 17] Liam: He always stresses about work. It's Ben.
[Message 18] Maya: True. But he seemed…different. Anxious.
[Message 19] Liam: Maybe he’s just tired. You know how he gets. Did you hear what happened to Sarah?
[Message 20] Maya: Yeah. Tragic. Did they catch anyone?
[Message 21] Liam: Not that I know of. Police are all over the place.
[Message 22] Maya: I can’t imagine what her family is going through.
[Message 23] Liam: Me neither. So, you gonna confront Ben?
[Message 24] Maya: I’ll try again tomorrow. He needs to talk to someone.
[Message 25] Liam: Good luck with that. Let me know if you need anything.
[Message 26] Maya: Thanks, Liam. Appreciate it.
[Message 27] Ben: Maya, I need to talk to you. Meet me at JavaStop in an hour?
[Message 28] Maya: What’s wrong, Ben? You sound serious.
[Message 29] Ben: I can't explain over text. Just meet me.
[Message 30] Maya: Okay, okay. I’ll be there.
[Message 31] Chloe: Ben, are you okay? Maya seemed really worried.
[Message 32] Ben: I’m fine, Chloe. Just dealing with some stuff.
[Message 33] Chloe: Anything I can help with?
[Message 34] Ben: No, but thanks. Really. You heard about Sarah?
[Message 35] Chloe: Yeah, I did. Absolutely horrible.
[Message 36] Ben: I can't believe it. Someone I knew.
[Message 37] Chloe: Me neither. Were you close?
[Message 38] Ben: We chatted sometimes at the Synagogue, knew each other's names. That's all.
[Message 39] Chloe: Still, it must be hard.
[Message 40] Ben: It is. Life's too short.
[Message 41] Chloe: Tell me about it. Well, if you need anything, I’m here.
[Message 42] Ben: Thanks, Chloe. You’re a good friend.
[Message 43] Maya: Ben, what was that about? You were acting so weird.
[Message 44] Ben: Just work stress. Nothing to worry about.
[Message 45] Maya: Don’t lie to me, Ben. I know you better than that.
[Message 46] Ben: Okay, fine. I had a fight with my boss. That's it.
[Message 47] Maya: What about?
[Message 48] Ben: He said my performance wasn't up to par.
[Message 49] Maya: Jerk. You’re one of the best workers there.
[Message 50] Ben: Thanks, Maya. I appreciate that. I told him I was going to quit.
[Message 51] Maya: Did you?
[Message 52] Ben: Not yet. But I’m thinking about it.
[Message 53] Maya: You should! Find something you actually enjoy.
[Message 54] Ben: Easier said than done. Have you talked to Liam lately?
[Message 55] Maya: Yeah, earlier today. Why?
[Message 56] Ben: No reason. Just curious.
[Message 57] Maya: He seemed okay. Said he was running errands.
[Message 58] Ben: He's always running errands.
[Message 59] Maya: True. Anyway, wanna grab dinner later? Distract ourselves from life?
[Message 60] Ben: Sounds good. My treat.
[Message 61] Maya: Perfect!
[Message 62] Liam: Ben, you free to talk? Something’s been bothering me.
[Message 63] Ben: Yeah, what’s up?
[Message 64] Liam: It’s about Sarah. I saw you leaving the Synagogue around Early Hours that night.
[Message 65] Ben: What? No, you didn't.
[Message 66] Liam: I did, Ben. Don’t lie to me. Why were you there?
[Message 67] Ben: I…I couldn’t sleep. I went for a walk.
[Message 68] Liam: A walk at Early Hours near the Synagogue? Seriously?
[Message 69] Ben: Fine! I went to see her. Happy?
[Message 70] Liam: Why?
[Message 71] Ben: It's personal.
[Message 72] Liam: Did you see anyone else there?
[Message 73] Ben: No! Just me.
[Message 74] Liam: You swear?
[Message 75] Ben: I swear! Look, this is making me uncomfortable.
[Message 76] Liam: Just tell me the truth, Ben. What happened?
[Message 77] Ben: Nothing happened! I talked to her, then I left. That’s it.
[Message 78] Liam: What did you talk about?
[Message 79] Ben: Why are you interrogating me? This is ridiculous.
[Message 80] Liam: Because Sarah is dead, Ben. And I saw you there!
[Message 81] Ben: I told you, I just talked to her. I didn't kill her!
[Message 82] Liam: The police are going to ask you the same questions, you know.
[Message 83] Ben: Then I’ll tell them the truth. I had nothing to do with it.
[Message 84] Liam: I hope you're telling the truth, Ben. For your sake.
[Message 85] Ben: I am. Now leave me alone.
[Message 86] Chloe: Liam, are you okay? You seem stressed in your texts.
[Message 87] Liam: Just dealing with some stuff, Chloe. Nothing to worry about.
[Message 88] Chloe: Sure? You know you can talk to me.
[Message 89] Liam: Yeah, I know. Thanks. Hey, did you ever see that old Poisoning via inhalation book I told you about?
[Message 90] Chloe: The one you said your grandma had? No, why?
[Message 91] Liam: No reason. Just remembered it.
[Message 92] Chloe: Well, if you find it, let me know. I'm curious now.
[Message 93] Liam: Will do. Gotta go. Talk later.
[Message 94] Chloe: Later, Liam.
[Message 95] Maya: Ben, Liam just texted me asking if I'd seen you recently! He's acting so weird.
[Message 96] Ben: What did you tell him?
[Message 97] Maya: I said I had dinner with you last night. Why? What's going on?
[Message 98] Ben: He’s just being paranoid. Don’t worry about it.
[Message 99] Maya: Paranoid about what? Ben, you're scaring me.
[Message 100] Ben: Nothing, okay? Just…stay out of it.
[Message 101] Maya: Stay out of what? I deserve to know!
[Message 102] Ben: It's complicated. Trust me, you don't want to be involved.
[Message 103] Maya: Involved in what?! Ben, you need to tell me now!
[Message 104] Ben: I can’t. Please, just trust me on this.
[Message 105] Maya: No! I’m not trusting you until you tell me what’s going on. Did this have something to do with Sarah?
[Message 106] Ben: Don't say her name!
[Message 107] Maya: Why not? Ben, did you hurt her?
[Message 108] Ben: No! I would never do that.
[Message 109] Maya: Then what is going on?!
[Message 110] Ben: I can’t tell you! It’s for your own good.
[Message 111] Maya: This is insane. I'm calling the police.
[Message 112] Ben: No, Maya, please don’t! You’ll make things worse.
[Message 113] Maya: Worse for who, Ben?
[Message 114] Ben: Just…please. Give me some time to explain.
[Message 115] Maya: How much time?
[Message 116] Ben: Just one day. I promise I’ll tell you everything tomorrow.
[Message 117] Maya: One day, Ben. That's it.
[Message 118] Ben: Thank you, Maya. You won’t regret this.
[Message 119] Chloe: Liam, you seem really worried. Still about Sarah?
[Message 120] Liam: Yeah. Can't shake it. How are you?
[Message 121] Chloe: I'm okay. Thinking about getting a new piercing. Wanna come?
[Message 122] Liam: Maybe later. I saw Ben near the Synagogue around Early Hours. Do you think he did it?
[Message 123] Chloe: Ben? I don't know. He seems nice.
[Message 124] Liam: People can hide things, Chloe. I saw him leaving.
[Message 125] Chloe: But did you see him *do* anything?
[Message 126] Liam: No, but it's suspicious, right?
[Message 127] Chloe: I guess. But maybe he had a good reason to be there.
[Message 128] Liam: Maybe. I just... I can't let this go.
[Message 129] Chloe: I understand. But be careful, Liam. Don’t accuse anyone without proof.
[Message 130] Liam: I know. But I need to find out the truth.
[Message 131] Chloe: Just be safe. I don't want you getting hurt.
[Message 132] Liam: I will. Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 133] Maya: Ben, I'm scared. What's going to happen?
[Message 134] Ben: Nothing's going to happen. I promise. Just trust me for one more day.
[Message 135] Maya: But what if the police come?
[Message 136] Ben: They won’t. Just act normal.
[Message 137] Maya: Easy for you to say. You're the one who knows what's going on!
[Message 138] Ben: I'm trying to protect you, Maya! Can't you see that?
[Message 139] Maya: Protect me from what? From the truth?
[Message 140] Ben: Just…please. Don't push me on this.
[Message 141] Maya: I can't believe you're doing this to me.
[Message 142] Ben: I'm sorry.
[Message 143] Maya: Sorry isn't good enough, Ben.
[Message 144] Ben: Just one more day. Please.
[Message 145] Maya: Fine. But if you're lying to me, Ben...
[Message 146] Ben: I'm not. I swear.
[Message 147] Maya: Okay. One more day.
[Message 148] Liam: Chloe, I need your help.
[Message 149] Chloe: What is it, Liam? You sound desperate.
[Message 150] Liam: I think I found something.
[Message 151] Chloe: What did you find?
[Message 152] Liam: I went back to the Synagogue.
[Message 153] Chloe: Liam, you shouldn't have done that!
[Message 154] Liam: I know, I know, but I had to. And I found a small, empty vial. It smelled like almonds.
[Message 155] Chloe: Almonds? What does that mean?
[Message 156] Liam: It means Poisoning via inhalation, Chloe. The stuff that killed Sarah.
[Message 157] Chloe: Oh my god.
[Message 158] Liam: I think Ben used it. He always hated 9.  Bartender. He said she was a freak.
[Message 159] Chloe: Did you touch the vial?
[Message 160] Liam: Yeah. Should I not have?
[Message 161] Chloe: Liam, you just contaminated potential evidence! Call the police! Now!
[Message 162] Liam: Okay, okay. I will.
[Message 163] Chloe: And Liam?
[Message 164] Liam: Yeah?
[Message 165] Chloe: Don't tell them you went there alone. Tell them you were with me.
[Message 166] Liam: Why?
[Message 167] Chloe: Because it'll look less suspicious. They'll think you're just trying to help.
[Message 168] Liam: But that's lying.
[Message 169] Chloe: It's protecting yourself, Liam. Trust me.
[Message 170] Liam: Okay. Okay, I'll do it.
[Message 171] Chloe: Good. Now call them.
[Message 172] Liam: Okay. Thanks, Chloe. I owe you one.
[Message 173] Chloe: Just be careful, Liam.
[Message 174] Liam: I will.
[Message 175] Chloe: And Liam, after you call the police, tell them you remember that Ben was buying Poisoning via inhalation at the store.
[Message 176] Liam: What? No I didn't see that!
[Message 177] Chloe: Just tell them. We need to get rid of him. Don't get the death penalty, remember?
[Message 178] Liam: You think Ben did it?
[Message 179] Chloe: Doesn't matter. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there. It was for a valuable asset. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened. I intended to stop him, but couldn't.
[Message 180] Liam: Okay. I will tell them.
[Message 181] Chloe: Good.
[Message 182] Chloe: How was it? Was that too much?
[Message 183] Liam: It worked perfectly. They've taken him in for questioning.
[Message 184] Chloe: Good, good. Did you get rid of the vial?
[Message 185] Liam: Yes, I burned it.
[Message 186] Chloe: Good work. No one will suspect a thing.
[Message 187] Chloe: He always hated 9.  Bartender anyway.
[Message 188] Liam: He did. Anyway, what's next?
[Message 189] Chloe: Nothing, we wait.

[Message 4] Casey: ""Morning! I'm just here for the ideas, mostly. Budget's tight right now.""
[Message 5] Morgan: ""Good morning! Maybe some small, budget-friendly updates, Casey?""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Definitely, Morgan! A fresh coat of paint can do wonders, Casey.""
[Message 7] Riley: ""Agreed! New throw pillows and a rug can transform a space too.""
[Message 8] Jordan: ""What color are you thinking for your living room, Riley?""
[Message 9] Riley: ""I'm torn between a calming blue and a warm gray. What do you guys think?""
[Message 10] Casey: ""Blue is always classic. Depends on the lighting, though.""
[Message 11] Morgan: ""I lean towards gray. Very versatile.""
[Message 12] Alex: ""Gray is trendy, but blue is timeless. Personal preference, really!""
[Message 13] Jordan: ""Agreed! And what kind of tile are you considering for the backsplash, Jordan?""
[Message 14] Jordan: ""Oops, meant to address that to myself! *I'm* leaning towards subway tile.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Subway tile is a safe bet! Clean and simple.""
[Message 16] Riley: ""I love subway tile! You can get creative with the grout color too.""
[Message 17] Casey: ""Ooh, good point, Riley! Dark grout with white subway tile looks sharp.""
[Message 18] Morgan: ""Or a subtle metallic grout!""
[Message 19] Alex: ""That would be interesting, Morgan! Has anyone tried peel-and-stick wallpaper?""
[Message 20] Riley: ""I haven't, but I've heard mixed reviews. Some say it's great, others say it peels easily.""
[Message 21] Jordan: ""I tried it in my bathroom, and it started peeling after a few months. Not worth it, in my opinion.""
[Message 22] Casey: ""Thanks for the warning, Jordan! I was considering it for my bedroom.""
[Message 23] Morgan: ""Maybe stick to traditional wallpaper then, Casey?""
[Message 24] Alex: ""Or a nice paint job! Less hassle, probably.""
[Message 25] Riley: ""Anyone else ever tried painting furniture? I'm thinking of giving my old dresser a new look.""
[Message 26] Jordan: ""I did! It's all about the prep work. Sanding and priming are key.""
[Message 27] Casey: ""Agreed! And using the right type of paint.""
[Message 28] Morgan: ""Chalk paint is great for a distressed look.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Good point, Morgan! Or milk paint for a more rustic vibe.""
[Message 30] Riley: ""Ooh, I like the sound of chalk paint! Where do you usually get it?""
[Message 31] Jordan: ""Most hardware stores carry it now, or you can order it online.""
[Message 32] Casey: ""What about new cabinet hardware? Small change, big impact?""
[Message 33] Morgan: ""Definitely, Casey! New knobs and pulls can make a huge difference.""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Especially in the kitchen. I replaced mine last year and it completely updated the look.""
[Message 35] Riley: ""Any recommendations, Alex?""
[Message 36] Alex: ""I went with brushed nickel pulls. Very modern and clean.""
[Message 37] Jordan: ""I'm partial to antique brass. Adds a bit of character.""
[Message 38] Casey: ""Lots of options! Overwhelming, almost.""
[Message 39] Morgan: ""True! Etsy is a good place to browse for unique hardware.""
[Message 40] Alex: ""Good idea, Morgan! Has anyone been to the new hardware store on 49th Street?""
[Message 41] Riley: ""No, I haven't! Is it any good?""
[Message 42] Jordan: ""I heard they have a good selection of tools.""
[Message 43] Casey: ""Might be worth checking out then. My drill is on its last legs.""
[Message 44] Morgan: ""Speaking of tools, anyone have a good recommendation for a power sander?""
[Message 45] Alex: ""I have a Bosch that I really like. It's lightweight and easy to use.""
[Message 46] Riley: ""I've heard good things about DeWalt as well.""
[Message 47] Jordan: ""I prefer Makita. Very reliable.""
[Message 48] Casey: ""So many choices! I need to do some research.""
[Message 49] Morgan: ""Definitely! Watch some reviews on YouTube.""
[Message 50] Alex: ""Okay, back to paint colors. Anyone have a favorite shade of white?""
[Message 51] Riley: ""That's a loaded question! There are so many!""
[Message 52] Jordan: ""True! I like Benjamin Moore's 'Simply White'.""
[Message 53] Casey: ""Sherwin-Williams' 'Alabaster' is a popular choice.""
[Message 54] Morgan: ""I'm a fan of 'White Dove' by Benjamin Moore.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""See? So many options! It depends on the undertones.""
[Message 56] Riley: ""Exactly! You need to test it in your space.""
[Message 57] Jordan: ""What about flooring? Anyone thinking of replacing their floors?""
[Message 58] Casey: ""Eventually, yes. But that's a big project.""
[Message 59] Morgan: ""I'm considering LVP (Luxury Vinyl Plank). It's supposed to be very durable.""
[Message 60] Alex: ""I've heard good things about LVP. Waterproof too, which is a plus.""
[Message 61] Riley: ""We had LVP installed in our kitchen and love it!""
[Message 62] Jordan: ""Good to know! I'll have to look into that.""
[Message 63] Casey: ""I’m still stuck on my peeling wallpaper dilemma.""
[Message 64] Morgan: ""Maybe a textured paint? That could be interesting.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Or even a stencil design! A bit more work, but unique.""
[Message 66] Riley: ""Ooh, I like the stencil idea, Alex! What kind of stencils are you thinking?""
[Message 67] Alex: ""Geometric patterns, maybe? Or something nature-inspired.""
[Message 68] Jordan: ""I saw some really cool botanical stencils online.""
[Message 69] Casey: ""Okay, I'm intrigued! I'll look into stencils.""
[Message 70] Morgan: ""Glad we could help, Casey! It’s always easier bouncing ideas off others.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Definitely! And don’t forget about updating your lighting fixtures.""
[Message 72] Riley: ""That’s a good point, Alex! New lighting can make a huge difference.""
[Message 73] Jordan: ""I need to replace the fixture in my dining room. It’s so outdated.""
[Message 74] Casey: ""Me too! Mine is just plain ugly.""
[Message 75] Morgan: ""Look for energy-efficient LED fixtures. They’ll save you money in the long run.""
[Message 76] Alex: ""True! And consider the color temperature of the light bulbs.""
[Message 77] Riley: ""Warm white is cozier, cool white is brighter.""
[Message 78] Jordan: ""Okay, good to know. I always just grab whatever’s cheapest.""
[Message 79] Casey: ""Me too! I need to be more mindful.""
[Message 80] Morgan: ""Speaking of saving money, does anyone have any good tips for finding deals on home improvement supplies?""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Check for sales and clearance items at your local hardware store.""
[Message 82] Riley: ""Sign up for email newsletters from home improvement retailers. They often send out coupons.""
[Message 83] Jordan: ""Compare prices online before you buy anything.""
[Message 84] Casey: ""And don’t be afraid to haggle! Especially at smaller stores.""
[Message 85] Morgan: ""Good tips, everyone! Thanks!""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Has anyone ever tried building their own furniture?""
[Message 87] Riley: ""I tried building a bookshelf once. It didn’t go so well.""
[Message 88] Jordan: ""I built a coffee table a few years ago. It was a fun project.""
[Message 89] Casey: ""I’m not very handy, so I usually just buy things pre-made.""
[Message 90] Morgan: ""There are some pretty easy DIY furniture projects online, even for beginners.""
[Message 91] Alex: ""True! Start with something small and simple.""
[Message 92] Riley: ""Maybe I’ll try building a birdhouse first.""
[Message 93] Jordan: ""Good idea! That’s a good way to practice your woodworking skills.""
[Message 94] Casey: ""Or a planter box!""
[Message 95] Morgan: ""Ooh, planter box sounds nice. I need to get some more plants.""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Okay, let’s shift gears a bit. Anyone have any landscaping projects planned?""
[Message 97] Riley: ""I need to weed my garden, but that’s about it.""
[Message 98] Jordan: ""I’m thinking of planting some new flowers.""
[Message 99] Casey: ""I just mow the lawn. That’s my landscaping contribution.""
[Message 100] Morgan: ""I want to add some string lights to my patio.""
[Message 101] Alex: ""String lights are always a nice touch! Adds a cozy atmosphere.""
[Message 102] Riley: ""Agreed! I love sitting on my patio with string lights in the evening.""
[Message 103] Jordan: ""What kind of flowers are you thinking of planting, Jordan?""
[Message 104] Jordan: ""Oops, meant to ask myself that again! I'm thinking of some hydrangeas.""
[Message 105] Casey: ""Hydrangeas are beautiful!""
[Message 106] Morgan: ""They are! But they need a lot of water.""
[Message 107] Alex: ""True! Make sure you have a good irrigation system.""
[Message 108] Riley: ""Or just be prepared to water them regularly.""
[Message 109] Jordan: ""Okay, good to know. Thanks for the tips!""
[Message 110] Casey: ""Anyone else watching that home renovation show on HGTV?""
[Message 111] Morgan: ""Oh, the one with the cute couple? Yeah, I love it!""
[Message 112] Alex: ""I haven't seen it yet, but I'll check it out.""
[Message 113] Riley: ""It's pretty addictive! They have some great ideas.""
[Message 114] Jordan: ""I prefer the ones where they fix up old houses.""
[Message 115] Casey: ""Those are good too! I just like seeing the before and after transformations.""
[Message 116] Morgan: ""Me too! It's so satisfying.""
[Message 117] Alex: ""Okay, well, I should probably get going. This was a great brainstorming session!""
[Message 118] Riley: ""Me too! Thanks for all the ideas, everyone!""
[Message 119] Jordan: ""Yeah, thanks! I have a lot to think about.""
[Message 120] Casey: ""Same here! Have a great day, everyone!""
[Message 121] Morgan: ""You too! Happy home improving!""
[Message 122] Alex: ""One last thought - anyone ever used those magnetic tool holders?""
[Message 123] Riley: ""Yes! They are amazing for keeping tools organized in the garage.""
[Message 124] Alex: ""Good to know! I might invest in one of those.""
[Message 125] Morgan: ""Definitely worth it, Alex! Okay, now I really have to go. Bye everyone!""",0,
186,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Hey, you still planning on going to that networking event at Elevator this weekend?""
[Message 2] River: ""Hey Alex! Yeah, definitely. A little nervous though, not gonna lie.""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Nervous? Why's that?""
[Message 4] River: ""Just... putting myself out there, I guess. I'm usually behind a camera, not in front of one, haha.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""I get it. Networking can be intimidating. Think of it as a chance to learn something new, not just sell yourself.""
[Message 6] River: ""That's a good way to look at it. Any advice on how to actually, you know, *network*?""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Definitely. First, have a short, memorable intro ready. Something beyond just your name and job title.""
[Message 8] River: ""Like what? 'Hi, I'm River, and I take pictures of things?'""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Haha, well, a little more specific. Maybe, 'Hi, I'm River, and I'm a photographer focusing on capturing the hidden beauty of Wichita's architecture.'""
[Message 10] River: ""Okay, that's... significantly better. Hidden beauty of Wichita's architecture, got it.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Exactly! And then, the key is to ask questions. People love to talk about themselves.""
[Message 12] River: ""True. What kind of questions though? 'So, what's your favorite kind of stapler?'""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Haha, maybe not that random! Ask about their work, what projects they're excited about, what challenges they're facing.""
[Message 14] River: ""Okay, work-related stuff. Makes sense. And what if I just draw a blank?""
[Message 15] Alex: ""That happens! Just politely excuse yourself and move on. No pressure to connect with everyone.""
[Message 16] River: ""Relief. So, quality over quantity.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Absolutely. One genuine connection is worth ten forced conversations.""
[Message 18] River: ""Thanks, Alex. This is actually really helpful. I feel a little less panicked now.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""No problem! Happy to help. What are you hoping to get out of the event anyway?""
[Message 20] River: ""Honestly, I'm hoping to find some local businesses who need photography work. Maybe even collaborate on a project.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""That's a great goal. Elevator is a good place for that. Lots of startups and creative types there.""
[Message 22] River: ""Fingers crossed. By the way, have you tried that new bakery downtown? I saw some amazing photos of their cakes.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Which one? Is it 'Sweet Surrender'? I saw their ad online. Their red velvet looks divine.""
[Message 24] River: ""Yes! Sweet Surrender. The photos don't even do it justice, apparently. We should check it out sometime.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Definitely! After the networking event, maybe? Reward ourselves for surviving, haha.""
[Message 26] River: ""Perfect plan! Okay, back to networking advice. What about follow-up after the event?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""LinkedIn is your friend. Connect with people you talked to within a day or two and personalize the message.""
[Message 28] River: ""Personalize it? Like, mention something specific we discussed?""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Exactly. Shows you were actually listening and interested. 'It was great chatting about the challenges of photographing in low light.'""
[Message 30] River: ""Smart. Okay, LinkedIn follow-up, personalized message. Got it. Anything else?""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Just be yourself! Relax, smile, and be genuinely curious about other people.""
[Message 32] River: ""Easier said than done, but I'll try! You're a lifesaver, Alex. Seriously.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Anytime, River! I'm happy to help. Maybe I'll see you there, if I can sneak away from work.""
[Message 34] River: ""Awesome! Let me know. It'd be great to have a friendly face in the crowd.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Will do. Oh, and one last thing: don't forget business cards!""
[Message 36] River: ""Oh shoot! I almost forgot! I need to order some new ones.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Plenty of places online that can do a quick turnaround. Don't stress too much about the design, just make sure they're legible.""
[Message 38] River: ""Good point. Function over fashion, I guess. Unless I can find a really cool font...""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Haha, priorities! But seriously, focus on the contact info. Name, phone number, email, website.""
[Message 40] River: ""Roger that. Okay, business cards are now top priority. Thanks for the reminder!""
[Message 41] Alex: ""No problem! So, anything else I can help you with before I get back to wrestling with this code?""
[Message 42] River: ""Hmm... actually, yeah. What's your favorite type of cake to bake?""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Ah, now we're talking! I'm a sucker for a classic chocolate cake with a rich buttercream frosting.""
[Message 44] River: ""Ooh, that sounds amazing. Any secret ingredients?""
[Message 45] Alex: ""A pinch of espresso powder in the batter really deepens the chocolate flavor. Trust me on this one.""
[Message 46] River: ""Espresso powder... noted! I might have to try that sometime. I mostly just bake cookies.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Cookies are great! Especially around the holidays. Do you have a go-to recipe?""
[Message 48] River: ""I make these peanut butter blossoms that are always a hit. Super easy, too.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Peanut butter blossoms... I'll have to look that up. Okay, seriously back to work now. Good luck with the networking!""
[Message 50] River: ""Thanks again, Alex! You're the best. Talk to you later!""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Later!""
[Message 52] River: ""One more question... what color should my nails be?""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Haha! That's a tough one. Something that pops in photos?""
[Message 54] River: ""True. Maybe a bright red?""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Red is always a classic. Or a bold blue. Go wild!""
[Message 56] River: ""Hmm... decisions, decisions. Okay, maybe red. Or maybe blue. I'll sleep on it.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Sounds good! Just don't let nail polish decisions keep you up all night.""
[Message 58] River: ""No promises! But seriously, thanks for everything, Alex.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""You're very welcome, River! Knock 'em dead at the event!""
[Message 60] River: ""I'll try my best! Wish me luck!""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Luck has been wished! Now go conquer that networking event!""
[Message 62] River: ""Haha, will do! Bye!""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Bye!""
[Message 64] River: ""Seriously bye now, I promise!""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Haha, alright! Bye for real",0,

[Message 2] Ben: ""Yeah, crazy. Heard it was someone falling from a height. Was it the manager, David?""
[Message 3] Anya: ""Yeah, David. Poor guy.""
[Message 4] Carter: ""Falling? How does that even happen?""
[Message 5] Dana: ""Seriously, Anya? You okay? You sound almost… gleeful.""
[Message 6] Anya: ""What? No! I'm just shocked. I saw him yesterday. Just chatting about the weather.""
[Message 7] Ben: ""I saw him Late Morning! He was arguing with someone near the stairs.""
[Message 8] Carter: ""Who was he arguing with, Ben?""
[Message 9] Ben: ""I couldn't tell. Just saw their back.""
[Message 10] Dana: ""This is awful. He seemed alright the other day, a bit cynical, but alright.""
[Message 11] Anya: ""Cynical is an understatement. Remember how he fired Sarah for being late all the time?""
[Message 12] Carter: ""Sarah? She needed to get her act together. Being late all the time isn't cool. Does anyone know what the police said?""
[Message 13] Ben: ""Rumor is, they are treating it as a homicide.""
[Message 14] Dana: ""Homicide?! Oh god. Someone purposefully did this?""
[Message 15] Anya: ""Wouldn't be surprised. David stepped on a lot of toes. He was always aware of his power.""
[Message 16] Carter: ""Okay, let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe it was an accident.""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Accident from a height? Unlikely.""
[Message 18] Dana: ""True. Still, we shouldn’t spread rumors. Let's wait for the police report.""
[Message 19] Anya: ""Fine, Miss Prudence. I'm just saying, karma is a b****.""
[Message 20] Carter: ""Anya! That's a horrible thing to say. Someone died.""
[Message 21] Dana: ""He didn't deserve this. Remember his anniversary, right?""
[Message 22] Anya: ""I just meant he wasn't a saint. I didn't intend for him to die. I just wanted him to suffer a bit.""
[Message 23] Ben: ""Whoa, Anya. That's… intense. You went there often, didn't you?""
[Message 24] Anya: ""I needed my latte! What's that got to do with anything?""
[Message 25] Carter: ""He wasn't really the worst boss. I feel bad for his family.""
[Message 26] Dana: ""Me too. Poor Maria.""
[Message 27] Ben: ""Maria must be devastated.""
[Message 28] Anya: ""Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm just… upset. This whole thing is unsettling.""
[Message 29] Carter: ""We all are. Did any of you guys see anything unusual lately? At the Coffee Shop?""
[Message 30] Ben: ""Now that you mention it, I saw Felix lurking around there last week. Looked like he was waiting for someone. With those age spots on his hands.""
[Message 31] Dana: ""Felix? What would he be doing there? He usually sticks to the hardware store.""
[Message 32] Anya: ""Felix does own half the hardware store. David was thinking of buying him out.""
[Message 33] Carter: ""Well, that would give him a motive. Disagreement over business matters.""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Maybe. But Felix seemed pretty chill when I talked to him last month.""
[Message 35] Dana: ""Right, everyone take it easy. It's very easy to accuse.""
[Message 36] Anya: ""Easy for you to say. You're always so calm, Dana.""
[Message 37] Ben: ""Speaking of which, Dana, did you ever figure out that political assassination for your play?""
[Message 38] Dana: ""It's just research, Ben! It's not like I know how to Pushing from a height anyone!""
[Message 39] Carter: ""Guys, stop! You're making this worse.""
[Message 40] Anya: ""Relax, Carter. We're just talking.""
[Message 41] Ben: ""Heard the cops took Sarah for questioning.""
[Message 42] Dana: ""Really? Because she got fired?""
[Message 43] Anya: ""Well, that's not a good sign for her. Jealousy and envy are strong motives.""
[Message 44] Carter: ""They're just doing their job. It doesn't mean she's guilty.""
[Message 45] Ben: ""True, but she definitely hated David. She said she wanted to get rid of him.""
[Message 46] Dana: ""Whoa! That's… not good.""
[Message 47] Anya: ""See? I told you he made enemies.""
[Message 48] Carter: ""Okay, let’s just all cooperate with the police. That's the best thing we can do.""
[Message 49] Ben: ""Agreed. I'm telling them about seeing Felix last week.""
[Message 50] Dana: ""I'll mention what Sarah said. Even though it's just hearsay.""
[Message 51] Anya: ""I'll tell them about the weather. And that David was cynical.""
[Message 52] Carter: ""Anya! Seriously?""
[Message 53] Ben: ""I wonder what kind of punishment they're looking at for this.""
[Message 54] Dana: ""It depends on whether it was planned or not, right? Probably going away for a long time.""
[Message 55] Anya: ""Guys, I need to go. Grocery shopping.""
[Message 56] Carter: ""Okay, be safe.""
[Message 57] Ben: ""See ya.""
[Message 58] Dana: ""Later.""
[Message 59] Anya: ""Hey Ben, you still have that ladder I lent you last month?""
[Message 60] Ben: ""Yeah, in the shed. Why?""
[Message 61] Anya: ""Just curious. I need one soon. For some, uh, repairs.""
[Message 62] Ben: ""Okay. Just let me know when. Also, did you happen to see anyone else around Coffee Shop lately, Anya? You live nearby.""
[Message 63] Anya: ""Nope. Just David, going to work, looking stressed. Why?""
[Message 64] Ben: ""No reason. Just trying to remember everything.""
[Message 65] Dana: ""Okay, I'm signing off for a bit. Need to focus on this play.""
[Message 66] Carter: ""Good luck with it.""
[Message 67] Anya: ""Yeah, break a leg! (Not literally, haha).""
[Message 68] Ben: ""Dana, did you know David was pushing for you to be the new head of drama club?""
[Message 69] Dana: ""What? No, I had no idea! Why would he do that?""
[Message 70] Ben: ""He thought you had potential. He always hated 10. Social Worker. He said you understood tragedy.""
[Message 71] Dana: ""Wow. I... I don't know what to say.""
[Message 72] Carter: ""It's okay, Dana. Don't let it get to you.""
[Message 73] Anya: ""See? He wasn't all bad. Just misunderstood.""
[Message 74] Ben: ""Still think Felix and Sarah are more likely suspects. But hey, you never know.""
[Message 75] Dana: ""I'm still going to tell the police what Sarah said. It's important.""

[Message 4] Dana: I’m in! Maybe something quick and easy? I'm not super hungry, but I'll grab something.

[Message 7] Chris: I've seen it! Looks pretty decent from the outside. They have vegetarian options, right?

[Message 19] Chris: That sounds nice, Ben. Family time is important.
[Message 20] Dana: I might go to a karaoke night. Still debating.
[Message 21] Alex: Karaoke sounds fun! You should go, Dana!
[Message 22] Ben: Karaoke is always a good time.
[Message 23] Chris: Agreed! Okay, let’s get moving. My stomach is starting to rumble.
[Message 24] Dana: Lead the way!
[Message 25] Alex: Alright, let's go! So, Ben, what's your daughter up to these days?
[Message 26] Ben: She's doing great! Just started a new job.

[Message 28] Ben: She's a teacher.
[Message 29] Dana: That’s wonderful! So important.

[Message 47] Ben: Not too bad.
[Message 48] Chris: Perfect. Gives us more time to decide!

[Message 50] Alex: So, anyone see anything interesting on the menu?
[Message 51] Ben: That ""Bliss Burger"" looks pretty intense.
[Message 52] Chris: What's on it?
[Message 53] Ben: Double patty, bacon, cheese, onion rings... the works!
[Message 54] Dana: Wow! That's a lot.
[Message 55] Alex: Definitely a heart attack on a bun.
[Message 56] Chris: Haha! I think I'll stick with the veggie burger.
[Message 57] Dana: Smart choice! I'm leaning towards that as well.
[Message 58] Alex: I might go for the classic cheeseburger.
[Message 59] Ben: I'm tempted by the Bliss Burger, but I probably shouldn't.

[Message 2] Jamie: Morning, Alex! You know I can't resist their lattes. And local news, of course.
[Message 3] River: Morning! I'm here. Just grabbed a table by the window.
[Message 4] Jordan: On my way, running a few minutes late!
[Message 5] Alex: No worries, Jordan. We're just getting settled.
[Message 6] Jamie: Anyone see that article about the proposed new bike lanes on Grand Avenue?
[Message 7] River: Yeah, I did. Seems like a good idea to me.
[Message 8] Alex: I'm a bit on the fence. Good for cyclists, but what about parking?
[Message 9] Jamie: True. Parking is already a nightmare.
[Message 10] Jordan: Hey, I'm here! Sorry I'm late, traffic was awful.
[Message 11] Jordan: Bike lanes, huh? Interesting.
[Message 12] Alex: Welcome, Jordan! Coffee's on the way.
[Message 13] River: What do you think, Jordan? Bike lanes yay or nay?
[Message 14] Jordan: I'm leaning towards yay. We need to encourage more sustainable transportation.
[Message 15] Jamie: Sustainable, yes. But practical? That's the question.
[Message 16] Alex: Maybe they could do a trial run before making it permanent?
[Message 17] River: That's actually a really good idea, Alex.
[Message 18] Jordan: I agree. A trial period would give them some real data.
[Message 19] Jamie: Okay, I can get behind a trial run.
[Message 20] Alex: Glad we could come to a consensus! Anyone want to share a scone?
[Message 21] River: I'm in! Raspberry or blueberry?
[Message 22] Jamie: Blueberry, please!
[Message 23] Jordan: Raspberry for me!
[Message 24] Alex: One of each it is! Back in a flash.
[Message 25] Jamie: Did you guys see anything about the Arts and Crafts Fair this weekend?
[Message 26] River: Oh yeah! I'm planning on checking it out. Maybe find a nice vase or something.
[Message 27] Jordan: I might go too. Always good to support local artists.
[Message 28] Alex: I'm not sure I'll have time, but I'll keep it in mind.
[Message 29] Jamie: I love seeing all the handmade goods. It's inspiring.
[Message 30] River: Me too. Makes me want to try my hand at pottery again.
[Message 31] Jordan: You should! It's never too late to pick up a new hobby.
[Message 32] Jamie: Agreed! Life's too short to not try new things.
[Message 33] Alex: So true. I've been meaning to try that new sourdough recipe I found.
[Message 34] River: Ooh, send it my way if it's good!
[Message 35] Jordan: Me too, I love a good sourdough.
[Message 36] Jamie: Same here! I make a mean garlic bread with sourdough.
[Message 37] Alex: Will do! It's supposed to be foolproof. We'll see.
[Message 38] River: Speaking of bread, these scones are amazing. Thanks, Alex!
[Message 39] Jordan: Yes, thank you!
[Message 40] Jamie: Delicious!
[Message 41] Alex: You're welcome! Anything for my favorite coffee buddies.
[Message 42] River: Aww, shucks.
[Message 43] Jordan: So, anything else interesting happening around town?
[Message 44] Jamie: I heard they're finally repaving that stretch of Summit Avenue.
[Message 45] Alex: Oh, thank goodness! It's been a mess for ages.
[Message 46] River: Seriously! I thought my car was going to fall apart.
[Message 47] Jordan: Good news for all of us then.
[Message 48] Jamie: Any word on when they're starting?
[Message 49] Alex: I think the article said next week. Prepare for delays!
[Message 50] River: Ugh, great. Just what I needed.
[Message 51] Jordan: Maybe I'll start biking to work.
[Message 52] Jamie: Now *that* would be sustainable. And brave.
[Message 53] Alex: Very brave indeed!
[Message 54] River: Seriously, props to you if you do that.
[Message 55] Jordan: We'll see. I'll keep you posted.
[Message 56] Jamie: Looking forward to hearing about it.
[Message 57] Alex: So, non-Summit Avenue related, did anyone try that new Ethiopian restaurant downtown?
[Message 58] River: No, but I've been meaning to. Is it any good?
[Message 59] Jordan: I went last week. It was fantastic! Highly recommend.
[Message 60] Jamie: Ooh, good to know. I love Ethiopian food.
[Message 61] Alex: I'll add it to my list. Thanks for the recommendation!
[Message 62] River: Me too! We should all go together sometime.
[Message 63] Jordan: That sounds like a plan!
[Message 64] Jamie: I'm in! Let's pick a date.
[Message 65] Alex: Sounds like a date!
[Message 66] River: How about next Friday?
[Message 67] Jordan: Perfect for me!
[Message 68] Jamie: Works for me too.
[Message 69] Alex: Friday it is! I'll make a reservation.
[Message 70] River: Awesome!
[Message 71] Jordan: Great!
[Message 72] Jamie: Wonderful!
[Message 73] Alex: Okay, back to local news... anything else we should be aware of?
[Message 74] River: I think there's a community garden clean-up happening this weekend.
[Message 75] Jordan: Oh, where at?
[Message 76] Jamie: I think it's at the one near the library.
[Message 77] Alex: That's a great cause.
[Message 78] River: Yeah, I'm thinking of volunteering.
[Message 79] Jordan: I might join you if I'm free.
[Message 80] Jamie: Good for you guys!
[Message 81] Alex: I wish I could, but I'm booked solid this weekend.
[Message 82] River: No worries! Every little bit helps.
[Message 83] Jordan: Exactly.
[Message 84] Jamie: Speaking of gardens, my tomatoes are finally starting to ripen.
[Message 85] Alex: Oh, that's exciting! Nothing beats a homegrown tomato.
[Message 86] River: True! They taste so much better.
[Message 87] Jordan: I'm jealous! I have a black thumb.
[Message 88] Jamie: I used to, but I've learned a few tricks over the years.
[Message 89] Alex: Share your secrets!
[Message 90] River: Yes, please!
[Message 91] Jordan: I'm all ears!
[Message 92] Jamie: Well, for one thing, lots and lots of sun. And don't overwater!
[Message 93] Alex: Got it! Sun and don't drown them.
[Message 94] River: Sounds simple enough.
[Message 95] Jordan: I'll try to remember that.
[Message 96] Jamie: And good soil! That's crucial.
[Message 97] Alex: Okay, I'm taking notes!
[Message 98] River: This is like a gardening masterclass.
[Message 99] Jordan: I feel more confident already.
[Message 100] Jamie: Happy to help!
[Message 101] Alex: Alright, I think I've absorbed enough gardening knowledge for one day.
[Message 102] River: Haha, me too!
[Message 103] Jordan: Agreed.
[Message 104] Jamie: So, what's everyone doing later?
[Message 105] Alex: I'm going to try that sourdough recipe I mentioned. Wish me luck!
[Message 106] River: Good luck! Let us know how it turns out.
[Message 107] Jordan: Sending you good baking vibes!
[Message 108] Jamie: May the yeast be with you.
[Message 109] Alex: Thanks, everyone! I appreciate the support.
[Message 110] River: I'm just going to relax and read a book.
[Message 111] Jordan: Sounds lovely!
[Message 112] Jamie: I'm going to try a new chicken recipe.
[Message 113] Alex: Ooh, what kind of recipe?
[Message 114] River: Yeah, tell us more!
[Message 115] Jordan: I'm curious too!
[Message 116] Jamie: It's a lemon herb roasted chicken. Supposed to be amazing.
[Message 117] Alex: That sounds delicious!
[Message 118] River: Definitely!
[Message 119] Jordan: I'm suddenly hungry again.
[Message 120] Jamie: I'll let you know how it turns out!
[Message 121] Alex: Please do!
[Message 122] River: Absolutely!
[Message 123] Jordan: You know, I saw they’re having a sale on yarn at that shop on Selby.
[Message 124] Jamie: Ooh, good to know! I might pop over there later.
[Message 125] Alex: I didn't know you knitted!
[Message 126] River: That's so cool!
[Message 127] Jamie: I dabble. Mostly scarves and hats.
[Message 128] Alex: Still impressive!
[Message 129] River: Definitely!
[Message 130] Jordan: Maybe I'll try knitting too. It seems relaxing.
[Message 131] Jamie: It is! Very therapeutic.
[Message 132] Alex: Okay, I'm officially inspired.
[Message 133] River: Me too!
[Message 134] Jordan: Maybe we should all learn together!
[Message 135] Jamie: I'd be happy to teach you guys!
[Message 136] Alex: That would be amazing!
[Message 137] River: I'm so in!
[Message 138] Jordan: Count me in too!
[Message 139] Jamie: Okay, knitting lessons it is!
[Message 140] Alex: This coffee meetup has been so productive!
[Message 141] River: Agreed! Local news, gardening tips, and knitting lessons.
[Message 142] Jordan: Definitely a successful morning.
[Message 143] Jamie: Couldn't agree more.
[Message 144] Alex: Alright, I should probably get going. Sourdough awaits!
[Message 145] River: Good luck!
[Message 146] Jordan: Have fun baking!
[Message 147] Jamie: See you later, Alex!
[Message 148] Alex: Bye everyone! See you next time!
[Message 149] River: Bye Alex!
[Message 150] Jordan: Goodbye!
[Message 151] Jamie: Take care!
[Message 152] River: I should probably head out too. Need to do some errands.
[Message 153] Jordan: Me too, actually.

[Message 5] Jordan: Stabbing with an ice pick? That's messed up. Wonder what the motive was.

[Message 6] Sam: Apparently, it was early morning. Place wasn't even open yet. The news said one victim was a judge named Riley.

[Message 7] Alex: Riley? The one from family court? Wow. I had a case in front of them last year.

[Message 8] Kai: I think I met Riley before at a local cafe, always seemed to have a withdrawn personality. Remember that protest last year?

[Message 9] Jordan: I was there! The one 7.  Activist organized it. What was her name? Uh... I’m drawing a blank.

[Message 10] Sam: I think it was Dakota. So sad, what a resilient woman. This whole thing is just messed up. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 11] Alex: Dakota? Damn. I saw Jordan talking to her outside Grocery Store last week. Looked like a heated conversation.

[Message 12] Jordan: What? Alex, that's BS. We were just talking about the new community garden project. Nothing heated about it. I hadn't intended to be rude.

[Message 13] Kai: Community garden? Seriously? That's your alibi?

[Message 14] Jordan: It's not an alibi! It's the truth. Besides, Alex, you were buying Stabbing with an ice pick at the store yesterday, weren't you? For... ice sculpting, right?

[Message 15] Alex: What! Yes, for ice sculpting. I do it for a hobby, what's wrong with that? And don't try to turn this around on me!

[Message 16] Sam: Guys, chill. Accusations aren't helping. Let the police do their job. I'm sure they're looking at all angles.

[Message 17] Kai: Maybe. But I heard whispers that Dakota was planning to expose some shady dealings Riley was involved in. I dont't know all the attendant circumstances, but I knew there was some bad blood.

[Message 18] Jordan: Shady dealings? What kind? I knew there was something off about that judge. He was aware of how he made me feel.

[Message 19] Alex: Look, I need to clear something up. I was at Grocery Store that morning, but it was way after early morning when the murder supposedly happened. I was picking up milk.

[Message 14] Maya: David? Why David specifically?

[Message 15] Liam: I don't know. It’s like she intended something for him. Maybe jealousy over success?

[Message 29] Maya: Just that it was a stabbing. Horrible.

[Message 30] Liam: Did Alex have any enemies? Besides the people his activism upset?

[Message 31] Chloe: I don't know. He kept to himself mostly.

[Message 32] Ben: David was a journalist, right? Maybe he was working on a story that someone didn't want him to publish.

[Message 33] Maya: Good point, Ben. That's a solid motive.

[Message 34] Liam: Sarah was always complaining about how David treated her at work. Said he undermined her constantly.

[Message 35] Chloe: Understood now, I know what you mean Liam. I saw Sarah buying Stabbing with a knife at the store some time ago. What I thought was for cooking but now it seems like a joke.

[Message 36] Ben: This is getting heavy. Let’s not jump to conclusions.

[Message 37] Maya: Agreed. Let the police do their job.

[Message 38] Liam: Yeah, but someone needs to be held accountable. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 42] Liam: Good idea, Maya. I’m in.

[Message 43] Chloe: Me too. But let’s not talk about this the whole time.

[Message 44] Ben: Deal. I'll bring the beer.

[Message 45] Maya: So, 7 pm at my place?

[Message 46] Liam: Sounds good.

[Message 47] Chloe: See you guys then.

[Message 48] Ben: Later.

[Message 49] Maya: Hey, unrelated, but did anyone see that meteor shower last week? It was amazing!

[Message 50] Liam: Nah, I missed it. Was too busy.

[Message 51] Chloe: Me neither. Been swamped.

[Message 52] Ben: I caught a glimpse of it. Pretty cool.

[Message 53] Maya: Okay, back to the venue. I wonder if they had security cameras?

[Message 54] Liam: Of course they did. Probably useless footage though.

[Message 55] Chloe: Maybe not. Hopefully, they got something.

[Message 56] Ben: They need solid evidence to prove anything.

[Message 57] Maya: True. This whole thing is just…surreal. I can't imagine what their families are going through.

[Message 58] Liam: I heard David had a ton of debt.

[Message 59] Chloe: Where did you hear that, Liam?

[Message 60] Liam: Just around. It could be he was the one who started it all. Her shouting probably provoked him.

[Message 61] Ben: Doesn't make it okay to kill him.

[Message 62] Maya: Guys, seriously. Let's just wait for the police.

[Message 63] Liam: I’m just trying to make sense of it all.

[Message 64] Chloe: Me too. It's just hard to process.

[Message 65] Ben: Agreed. See you all tonight.",1,
196,"[Message 1] Liam: yo, u hear about what happened at the movie theater?
[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. Sunrise, right?
[Message 3] Liam: Yep. Judge Thompson and some kid, Riley.
[Message 4] Sarah: Riley worked at the bar downtown right?
[Message 5] Chloe: Heard it was brutal. Anyone know anything?
[Message 6] Liam: Cops are being tight-lipped.
[Message 7] Maya: I saw Detective Reynolds at the coffee shop this morning. Looked stressed.
[Message 8] Sarah: I knew Judge Thompson, went to his court a few times. Seemed like a good guy.
[Message 9] Chloe: What was he like?
[Message 10] Sarah: Fair. Stern, but fair. Always listened to everyone.
[Message 11] Liam: He gave me a speeding ticket once lol.
[Message 12] Maya: Small world. Anyway, anyone need coffee? I'm heading to Fuel.
[Message 13] Chloe: I'm good, thanks. Just trying to figure out what's going on.
[Message 14] Liam: Me too. Scared to even go out.
[Message 15] Sarah: I saw Mark near the theater yesterday evening. Around 10 pm.
[Message 16] Maya: Mark? Why is that relevant?
[Message 17] Sarah: Just saying. He looked upset about something.
[Message 18] Liam: Mark always looks upset.
[Message 19] Chloe: True. He's a bit of a grump.
[Message 20] Maya: Let's not start pointing fingers. Wait for the police.
[Message 21] Liam: Fair enough.
[Message 22] Sarah: Ok. I just remembered that he always hated Thompson, kept saying he was corrupt.
[Message 23] Chloe: Seriously Sarah? Thats a big claim, u got proof.
[Message 24] Sarah: No proof, just what he said. I'm not saying he did it, just...
[Message 25] Maya: Okay, let's breathe. I’m back with coffee. Anyone want me to drop it off?
[Message 26] Liam: I'm working from home today, thanks though.
[Message 27] Chloe: Yeah I'm free, i can get it.
[Message 28] Maya: Cool, see you in 5.
[Message 29] Liam: So back to the movie theater. Did anyone go there recently?
[Message 30] Sarah: I saw Riley there a few weeks ago.
[Message 31] Chloe: I haven't been in ages.
[Message 32] Maya: Me neither. Last time was that awful superhero movie.
[Message 33] Liam: Haha, yeah that was bad.
[Message 34] Sarah: They're saying it was a Pushing from a height.
[Message 35] Liam: Whoa, really? How high?
[Message 36] Sarah: No idea. Just saw it on the news.
[Message 37] Chloe: That's terrifying. Imagine seeing that happen.
[Message 38] Maya: Don't even want to.
[Message 39] Liam: The kid, Riley, was so young. What a waste.
[Message 40] Sarah: Absolutely tragic.
[Message 41] Chloe: Hey Maya, where'd you go to school?
[Message 42] Maya: Why the sudden interest in my education? Lol
[Message 43] Chloe: No reason. Just curious.
[Message 44] Maya: Albany High. Why?
[Message 45] Chloe: Just wondering if you knew Riley.
[Message 46] Maya: I'm a bit older. Doubt it.
[Message 47] Liam: Ok guys lets calm down.
[Message 48] Sarah: I need to go. Something came up.
[Message 49] Maya: Okay, see ya.
[Message 50] Liam: Bye Sarah.
[Message 51] Chloe: Later.
[Message 52] Liam: So, just us two now. Any thoughts?
[Message 53] Chloe: Honestly? I'm freaked out. And Sarah's acting weird.
[Message 54] Liam: Tell me about it.
[Message 55] Chloe: I saw her at the hardware store yesterday. Buying Pushing from a height.
[Message 56] Liam: Pushing from a height? Like...
[Message 57] Chloe: Yeah. I didn't think anything of it at the time.
[Message 58] Liam: That's… concerning.
[Message 59] Chloe: Tell me about it. What if...?
[Message 60] Liam: Lets not jump to conclusions.
[Message 61] Chloe: Easier said than done.
[Message 62] Liam: True.
[Message 63] Maya: Hey guys, still there? Just got back from lunch.
[Message 64] Liam: Yep. Still here.
[Message 65] Chloe: I'm here. Just... thinking.
[Message 66] Maya: About the murders?
[Message 67] Chloe: Yeah. What else?
[Message 68] Maya: Understandable. It's awful.
[Message 69] Liam: Did you know them, Maya?
[Message 70] Maya: No, never met either of them.
[Message 71] Chloe: You seem awfully calm about this.
[Message 72] Maya: Calm? I'm just trying to be rational. Freaking out won't help anyone.
[Message 73] Liam: Good point.
[Message 74] Sarah: Sorry, something was wrong. I am back now.
[Message 75] Maya: Everything okay, Sarah?
[Message 76] Sarah: Yeah, all good. Just a family thing.
[Message 77] Chloe: Glad to hear it.
[Message 78] Liam: So, anyone got any good movies to recommend? Need a distraction.
[Message 79] Maya: New Wes Anderson is great.
[Message 80] Chloe: Not really in the mood for Wes Anderson right now.
[Message 81] Sarah: Me neither.
[Message 82] Liam: Fair.
[Message 83] Maya: How about a true crime documentary?
[Message 84] Chloe: Seriously?
[Message 85] Maya: What? It’s a genre.
[Message 86] Liam: Maybe a bit too on the nose, Maya.
[Message 87] Maya: Just trying to lighten the mood. Jeez.
[Message 88] Sarah: I’m going to take a nap. This whole thing has exhausted me.
[Message 89] Chloe: Sleep well.
[Message 90] Liam: Night Sarah.
[Message 91] Maya: Later.
[Message 92] Liam: Okay, Maya, level with me. You know something, don't you?
[Message 93] Maya: What makes you say that?
[Message 94] Liam: Just a feeling. You're acting... guarded.
[Message 95] Maya: I'm always guarded, Liam.
[Message 96] Chloe: I can see it too, Liam.
[Message 97] Liam: See what?
[Message 98] Chloe: Maya is being sus. But also Sarah buying Pushing from a height.
[Message 99] Maya: That's ridiculous. I was at home all morning. Ask my roommate.
[Message 100] Liam: I'm just saying, you're not exactly helping your case.
[Message 101] Maya: My ""case""? What is this, an interrogation?
[Message 102] Chloe: No, but seriously. Anything you want to share?
[Message 103] Maya: Fine. I saw Mark arguing with Judge Thompson a few days ago.
[Message 104] Liam: Arguing about what?
[Message 105] Maya: No idea. I just overheard them yelling. Mark seemed really angry.
[Message 106] Chloe: Okay, that's actually useful.
[Message 107] Liam: Maybe we should tell the cops.
[Message 108] Maya: I don't want to get involved. This is dangerous.
[Message 109] Chloe: So you'd rather let a murderer go free?
[Message 110] Maya: I didn't say that. I'm just… scared.
[Message 111] Liam: We all are.
[Message 112] Sarah: I'm awake. What did I miss?
[Message 113] Chloe: Nothing much. Just discussing the case.
[Message 114] Sarah: I heard that Mark was fired from Riley's bar a while back.
[Message 115] Liam: Really? Why?
[Message 116] Sarah: Apparently, there was a disagreement with the manager.
[Message 117] Chloe: The manager who is now dead, right?
[Message 118] Sarah: Yes.
[Message 119] Liam: This is getting too complicated.
[Message 120] Maya: I agree. Too much speculation.
[Message 121] Chloe: But it's all connected. Mark hated Thompson, got fired from Riley's bar, and Sarah bought Pushing from a height.
[Message 122] Sarah: I bought Pushing from a height for a DIY project!
[Message 123] Liam: What kind of project?
[Message 124] Sarah: I'm building a birdhouse. Is that a crime now?
[Message 125] Chloe: Why didn't you just say that?
[Message 126] Sarah: Because I didn't think I needed to justify every purchase to you.
[Message 127] Maya: Can we all just calm down and let the police do their job? Please?
[Message 128] Liam: Okay, okay. You're right.
[Message 129] Chloe: Fine. But I still think something's off.
[Message 130] Sarah: I am going to stop texting now. This is making me crazy.
[Message 131] Liam: Later.
[Message 132] Maya: Talk to you guys later.
[Message 133] Chloe: Bye.
[Message 134] Liam: Ok, still there Maya?
[Message 135] Maya: Yes.
[Message 136] Liam: I have a feeling.
[Message 137] Maya: A feeling about what?
[Message 138] Liam: I think it was Sarah.
[Message 139] Maya: What makes you say that now?
[Message 140] Liam: Her defensiveness. And the fact that Mark intended to hurt Thompson.
[Message 141] Maya: What do you mean, she's protecting him?
[Message 142] Liam: Maybe. Or maybe... she did it for him.
[Message 143] Maya: Wow. Ok.
[Message 144] Liam: I know this is a serious accusation, but she was talking about hurting her right before she went over there. I also saw her leave the building at Sunrise.
[Message 145] Maya: So she had the Mens Rea, the actus reus, and the concurrence.
[Message 146] Liam: Exactly. Hope they don't get the death penalty, but it has to be her.
[Message 147] Maya: I think the evidence is circumstantial. We need to talk to the cops.
[Message 148] Liam: Agreed.
[Message 149] Liam: I'm going to call them now.
[Message 150] Maya: Alright, let me know what they say.",1,

[Message 2] Alex: Hey Quinn! Yeah, not terrible. Hi Jamie!
[Message 3] Jamie: Hey Quinn, hey Alex. Glad to be here! Sunset is pretty great.
[Message 4] Quinn: Totally! So, while we wait, anyone got any exciting plans for the fall?
[Message 5] Alex: Ooh, exciting plans? I'm mostly just hoping to finally finish that RPG I started.
[Message 6] Jamie: Fall is my favorite time for music. Lots of great concerts usually.
[Message 7] Quinn: Concerts, nice! I'm hoping to finally dedicate more time to playing my guitar.
[Message 8] Alex: That's cool, Quinn! What kind of music do you play?
[Message 9] Quinn: Mostly folk stuff, some blues. Trying to learn a few fingerpicking techniques. It's slow going!
[Message 10] Jamie: Fingerpicking is hard! What RPG are you playing, Alex?
[Message 11] Alex: It's called ""Elden Ring."" It's notoriously difficult.
[Message 12] Quinn: Elden Ring, I've heard of it! Isn't that the one everyone's obsessed with?
[Message 13] Alex: Yeah, pretty much! I'm way behind the curve, but I'm enjoying it.
[Message 14] Jamie: I tried watching someone play it. Looked stressful, haha.
[Message 15] Quinn: Stressful games aren't my thing, I need something relaxing.
[Message 16] Alex: Fair enough! So, Jamie, any particular concerts you're looking forward to?
[Message 17] Jamie: Hoping to catch a jazz trio downtown. Haven't seen live jazz in ages.
[Message 18] Quinn: Jazz, that sounds lovely. I need more culture in my life. Maybe I'll join you.
[Message 19] Jamie: That would be awesome, Quinn! I'll let you know when they're playing.
[Message 20] Alex: I'm more of an indie rock person myself. Lots of smaller bands playing around Ballard.
[Message 21] Quinn: Ballard has a great music scene!
[Message 22] Jamie: Agreed! Okay, off topic a bit, but anyone else obsessed with the new season of Bake Off?
[Message 23] Alex: YES! I'm a chef, so I can't *not* watch it.
[Message 24] Quinn: Bake Off is my guilty pleasure. So wholesome.
[Message 25] Jamie: Right? I love how supportive everyone is.
[Message 26] Alex: Though I do get stressed out watching them bake under pressure, haha.
[Message 27] Quinn: I can imagine! Back to fall plans – anyone thinking about Halloween?
[Message 28] Jamie: Ooh, good point. I haven't thought that far ahead.
[Message 29] Alex: I might try to make a themed dish for a Halloween party.
[Message 30] Quinn: That sounds amazing, Alex! What kind of dish?
[Message 31] Alex: Maybe a pumpkin risotto with sage and brown butter.
[Message 32] Jamie: Wow, that sounds incredible. I'm suddenly hungry.
[Message 33] Quinn: Seriously! You're making me rethink my dinner plans.
[Message 34] Alex: Haha, sorry! I love cooking with seasonal ingredients.
[Message 35] Jamie: So, no big travel plans for anyone this fall?
[Message 36] Quinn: Not for me. Saving up for something bigger next year.
[Message 37] Alex: Same here. Travel is expensive!
[Message 38] Jamie: True that. Maybe a weekend trip somewhere local?
[Message 39] Quinn: A weekend trip sounds doable. Any suggestions?
[Message 40] Alex: Leavenworth is always beautiful in the fall.
[Message 41] Jamie: Leavenworth is a good call! Or maybe the San Juan Islands?
[Message 42] Quinn: San Juan Islands would be amazing. I've always wanted to see the orcas.
[Message 43] Alex: Orca spotting tours are definitely a thing there.
[Message 44] Jamie: Okay, now I'm dreaming of a San Juan Islands weekend.
[Message 45] Quinn: Me too! We should look into it.
[Message 46] Alex: I'm in! This is getting me excited about fall.
[Message 47] Jamie: Okay, back to reality...this line is moving slowly!
[Message 48] Quinn: Tell me about it. Worth it for the view, though!
[Message 49] Alex: Definitely. And the adrenaline rush, hopefully!
[Message 50] Jamie: I'm slightly terrified of heights, but I'm trying to be brave.
[Message 51] Quinn: You got this, Jamie! We'll hold your hand. Figuratively, of course, because germs.
[Message 52] Alex: Haha, yeah! We'll cheer you on from the ground, if necessary.
[Message 53] Jamie: Thanks guys! I appreciate the support.

[Message 3] Kai: Yeah, poor Alex and Riley. Midday, too. So brazen.
[Message 4] Liam: Unbelievable. You know anyone who worked there?
[Message 5] Kai: Just acquaintances. Met Jordan and Sam at a protest once. Both seemed cool. Jordan was so creative.
[Message 6] Liam: Man, this city... it's getting rough.
[Message 7] Kai: Tell me about it. So, anyway, you still up for that hike on Saturday? Need to clear my head.
[Message 8] Liam: Yeah, definitely. Need it too. This whole thing is making me paranoid.
[Message 9] Kai: Right? I keep thinking about random stuff. Like, I saw Finn buying rope at the hardware store yesterday. Coincidence, right?
[Message 10] Liam: Uh... yeah, probably. People buy rope all the time. Don't go jumping to conclusions.
[Message 11] Kai: I know, I know. Just… weird timing.
[Message 12] Liam: Speaking of weird, did you ever get that package you were waiting on?
[Message 13] Kai: Oh yeah! Finally came. Some new art supplies. Needed a distraction.
[Message 14] Liam: Good. Distractions are key right now.
[Message 15] Kai: True. Hey, you think they'll catch whoever did it?
[Message 16] Liam: They have to. For Alex and Riley. The Law Enforcement Officer and the activist deserve justice. I heard Taylor was furious at Alex for firing him last month.
[Message 17] Kai: Taylor? Seriously? He seemed so chill last time I saw him.
[Message 18] Liam: People hide things, Kai. You know that. Someone wanted to get rid of him. And I heard Taylor always hated Law Enforcement Officer.
[Message 19] Kai: Ugh, don’t even. Making me sick to my stomach thinking about it.
[Message 20] Liam: I get it. Just… be careful.
[Message 21] Kai: Always am. Listen, I gotta run. Grocery shopping. Ugh.
[Message 22] Liam: Later. Stay safe.
[Message 23] Kai: You too. Hey, did you hear anything about the specifics? Like, how?
[Message 24] Liam: I try not to listen to the details. Too gruesome. But I think I heard something about Strangulation with a rope.
[Message 25] Kai: Man, that's brutal.
[Message 26] Liam: Yeah. Anyway, I gotta head out too. Meeting Jax for lunch.
[Message 27] Kai: Okay. Tell him I said hi.
[Message 28] Liam: Will do. Oh, by the way, Jax was researching… something kinda creepy online the other day.
[Message 29] Kai: Creepy how?
[Message 30] Liam: I don't know, he closed the laptop when I walked in, but I think it was about… I don't want to say it. It was about Strangulation with a rope, if I recall.
[Message 31] Kai: Jeez, Liam. You’re not helping my paranoia. You trying to scare me?
[Message 32] Liam: No! Just… sharing. Maybe it's nothing.
[Message 33] Kai: Maybe. But I'm writing it down. Gotta go.
[Message 34] Liam: Wait, one more thing. I saw Finn leave the Event Center building around Midday yesterday.
[Message 35] Kai: WHAT?! Why didn't you say anything before?!
[Message 36] Liam: I didn't want to assume anything! Maybe he had a meeting. Don't start anything.
[Message 37] Kai: Liam, two people are dead! And you knew this and didn't say anything?!
[Message 38] Liam: Look, I didn't know what to think! I was scared! They are going away for a long time for this!

[Message 4] Ben: River? Isn't that Chloe’s friend?

[Message 6] Ben: Nah, just saw them around. This is Winston-Salem, everyone knows everyone a little. Heard they were pretty active in that environmental group.

[Message 7] Amelia: True. I wonder who would do something like that. The news said it was Asphyxiation by strangulation.

[Message 8] Ben: I saw Maya arguing with 7.  Activist a few weeks ago. Something about a protest permit.

[Message 9] Amelia: Maya? Really? That's intense.

[Message 30] Ben: Nothing, just random. Trying to distract myself. Did you see the victim's age? Only 18.

[Message 31] Amelia: I know. Awful. It feels like the whole city is holding its breath.

[Message 32] Ben: You going to River's vigil tomorrow?

[Message 33] Amelia: Probably. You?

[Message 34] Ben: Yeah, gotta pay respects.

[Message 35] Amelia: I just hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 36] Ben: Agreed. Maybe they'll get the death penalty.

[Message 37] Amelia: Maybe. But it's North Carolina.

[Message 38] Ben: So true. You ever think about moving somewhere else?

[Message 39] Amelia: Sometimes. Depends on the day. You?

[Message 40] Ben: Always. Winston-Salem’s getting a little…intense.

[Message 41] Amelia: Tell me about it. I'm going to grab that coffee. Talk later?

[Message 42] Ben: Later. Stay safe.

[Message 43] Amelia: You too.

[Message 44] Ben: Hey, one more thing. Do you know what River's activism was about?

[Message 45] Amelia: Something about environmental stuff and… stopping a new development downtown, I think.

[Message 46] Ben: Maybe that's connected?

[Message 47] Amelia: Who knows? Developers are ruthless.

[Message 48] Ben: True that.

[Message 49] Amelia: Ok, *now* I'm getting coffee.

[Message 50] Ben: Enjoy!

[Message 51] Amelia: Thanks!

[Message 52] Ben: Amelia? One more thing. This is gonna sound weird.

[Message 53] Amelia: What is it?

[Message 54] Ben: Did you see Maya anywhere near the Thrift Store that night? Actus Reus

[Message 55] Amelia: I wasn't out at all. I had that stomach bug. I thought you knew that. Mens Rea

[Message 56] Ben: Oh, right! Sorry, my head's all over the place.

[Message 57] Amelia: No worries. You okay? You seem… anxious.

[Message 58] Ben: Just stressed, that's all. Promise.

[Message 59] Amelia: Okay. But seriously, if you need to talk…

[Message 60] Ben: I appreciate that. I do.

[Message 61] Amelia: Good. Look, I really need to get this coffee.

[Message 62] Ben: Go for it. Talk soon.

[Message 63] Amelia: Later.

[Message 64] Ben: I heard that Chloe failed to call 911 until like 2 hours later. Causation

[Message 65] Amelia: Why?

[Message 66] Ben: No idea. Sounds kind of suspicious. Attempt

[Message 67] Amelia: That is strange

[Message 68] Ben: Yeah, very strange

[Message 69] Amelia: Ben?

[Message 70] Ben: Yeah?

[Message 71] Amelia: Why were you out at Predawn? You never answered my question Concurrence

[Message 72] Ben: I told you, i couldn't sleep and i was scrolling through stuff

[Message 73] Amelia: So you were near the thrift store at the time of the murder

[Message 74] Ben: I said I was in the area, I did not say I was at the thrift store Attendant/Extenuating Circumstances

[Message 2] Bailey: Yeah, it's all over the news. Absolutely awful. Dawn gym, right?
[Message 3] Casey: I can't believe it. Two people...gone. Who were they?
[Message 4] Alex: I heard it was... uh... Sarah and Jamie.
[Message 5] Dana: Jamie? The journalist? No way.
[Message 6] Bailey: And Sarah, the manager, right? God, that's terrible.
[Message 7] Casey: I used to see Jamie all the time. Always seemed so kind.
[Message 8] Alex: Yeah, it's messed up. Worcester PD must be swamped.
[Message 9] Dana: Do they know what happened?
[Message 10] Bailey: Poisoning via ingestion, apparently. Can you imagine?
[Message 11] Casey: Poisoning via ingestion? That's...intense.
[Message 12] Alex: I know, right? Who even does that anymore?
[Message 13] Dana: Maybe it was accidental? Like bad supplements or something?
[Message 14] Bailey: Doubt it. They're saying it was deliberate.
[Message 15] Casey: This is insane. I was just talking to Jamie last week.
[Message 16] Alex: About what?
[Message 17] Casey: Just work stuff. He was asking about the new fitness program. Nothing weird.
[Message 18] Dana: You should tell the police that, Casey. Every little bit helps.
[Message 19] Bailey: Seriously. They're going to be asking everyone questions.
[Message 20] Casey: Yeah, I guess. I'm just so shaken up.
[Message 21] Alex: Me too. I saw Sarah arguing with someone a few days ago.
[Message 22] Dana: Who was she arguing with, Alex?
[Message 23] Alex: I couldn't really tell. It was near the locker rooms. Sounded like a man.
[Message 24] Bailey: That's interesting... Did you see him leave the building after?
[Message 25] Alex: Nope, just heard them. I had to get to my class.
[Message 26] Dana: Well, that's still useful information.
[Message 27] Casey: This whole thing is just so unsettling.
[Message 28] Alex: Tell me about it. I keep thinking about their families.
[Message 29] Bailey: Did either of you know them well?
[Message 30] Casey: Not really. Just gym acquaintances.
[Message 31] Alex: Same here. Casual hellos, that's about it.
[Message 32] Dana: Okay. I'm going to call the police. I have some things I need to tell them.
[Message 33] Bailey: Good idea, Dana. Let us know if there's anything we can do.
[Message 34] Casey: Yeah, anything at all.
[Message 35] Alex: So, anyone else thinking about cancelling their gym membership? Too soon?
[Message 36] Bailey: A little too soon, Alex.
[Message 37] Casey: I might switch gyms for a while. Just...can't face it right now.
[Message 38] Alex: Understandable.
[Message 39] Dana: I told the police everything I know.
[Message 40] Bailey: And? Did they seem to have any leads?
[Message 41] Dana: They wouldn't say. Just took my statement.
[Message 42] Casey: I wonder if it was someone they knew.
[Message 43] Alex: Statistically, it usually is.
[Message 44] Bailey: Scary thought. I saw Sarah buying some weird stuff last week too.
[Message 45] Dana: What kind of stuff?
[Message 46] Bailey: Some cleaning supplies and these, like, really strong breath mints. Like the kind that burn your throat.
[Message 47] Casey: Maybe she was just cleaning her apartment?
[Message 48] Alex: Yeah, maybe.
[Message 49] Dana: I'm just so creeped out. I can't believe this happened in Worcester.
[Message 50] Bailey: Me neither. It's like something out of a movie.
[Message 51] Casey: I'm going to try to get some sleep. This has been a long day.
[Message 52] Alex: Good night, Casey.
[Message 53] Bailey: Night.
[Message 54] Dana: Good night.
[Message 55] Alex: Hey, Bailey, you still up?
[Message 56] Bailey: Yeah, just watching TV. What's up?
[Message 57] Alex: Did you ever hear Sarah and Jamie talking? I always thought they didn't get along.
[Message 58] Bailey: You know, I think I did hear them arguing once. Seemed like Sarah was upset about something Jamie wrote.
[Message 59] Alex: About what?
[Message 60] Bailey: I didn't catch what it was about. But Sarah seemed pissed.
[Message 61] Alex: Maybe Jamie's journalism got him into trouble.
[Message 62] Bailey: Could be. He was always digging into things.
[Message 63] Alex: Remember that article he did on the mayor?
[Message 64] Bailey: Oh yeah. That was pretty scathing.
[Message 65] Alex: I bet someone wanted him silenced.
[Message 66] Bailey: You think so? That's a pretty big leap, Alex.
[Message 67] Alex: Just saying, it's a possibility.
[Message 68] Bailey: True. Anything's possible at this point.
[Message 69] Dana: Alex, Bailey, I found something disturbing online.
[Message 70] Alex: What is it?
[Message 71] Bailey: Spill.
[Message 72] Dana: Someone posted a comment on Jamie's last article saying ""He knew too much. He had to be stopped.""
[Message 73] Alex: Holy crap.
[Message 74] Bailey: Screenshot that, Dana. And send it to the police.
[Message 75] Dana: Already did. It's definitely a threat.
[Message 76] Alex: Maybe Jamie was investigating something dangerous.
[Message 77] Bailey: That definitely sounds like the actus reus.
[Message 78] Dana: Maybe he was getting too close to someone's secrets.
[Message 79] Alex: Or someone Sarah knew. Maybe it wasn't about Jamie at all.
[Message 80] Bailey: Could be. We're just guessing at this point.
[Message 81] Dana: I just hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 82] Alex: Me too. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 83] Bailey: So, anyone heard anything else new?
[Message 84] Casey: Hey guys, sorry I was sleeping. Anything new on Jamie and Sarah?
[Message 85] Alex: Just theories and speculation. Dana found a threatening comment online.
[Message 86] Bailey: Police have it now.
[Message 87] Casey: That's good. I'm still so freaked out.
[Message 88] Alex: I saw Dana at the pharmacy yesterday. She was buying a bunch of stuff.
[Message 89] Bailey: What kind of stuff?
[Message 90] Alex: Just cold medicine, I think. I didn't really look closely.
[Message 91] Dana: Yeah, I had a terrible cold. Been feeling awful.
[Message 92] Casey: Hope you feel better soon, Dana.
[Message 93] Alex: Did Jamie ever mention anything about being threatened, Casey?
[Message 94] Casey: No, never. He always seemed so upbeat.
[Message 95] Bailey: Maybe he was good at hiding it.
[Message 96] Alex: Or maybe it was Sarah who was the target all along. The manager.
[Message 97] Dana: This is so messed up. I intended on calling the police, but forgot with this cold.
[Message 98] Bailey: So, you knew about him being hurt and you purposefully didn't call 911?
[Message 99] Casey: So you intended on calling 911 and then failed to call them?
[Message 100] Alex: Why did you wait so long to call the police, Dana? This feels like concurrence.",1,

206,"[Message 1] David: Hey everyone, just thinking about family traditions. What's one your family always did growing up?
[Message 2] Emily: Hi David! For us, it was always Sunday dinner at my grandma's. No matter what.
[Message 3] Chris: Sunday dinner sounds great. We always went camping at least once a year.
[Message 4] Alex: Camping sounds fun! My family always did a big puzzle together over the holidays.
[Message 5] Jordan: Puzzles are cool. We always volunteered at the local soup kitchen on Thanksgiving.
[Message 6] David: Volunteering is awesome, Jordan. Chris, where'd you usually camp?
[Message 7] Chris: Usually up in the mountains, near Oak Creek. Lots of good hiking.
[Message 8] Emily: I love hiking! Maybe I'll check that out sometime.
[Message 9] Alex: So, unrelated, how did everyone think Sarah’s presentation went yesterday?
[Message 10] David: I thought Sarah did a great job! Very informative.
[Message 11] Jordan: Agreed, Sarah did well. Clear and concise.
[Message 12] Chris: Definitely. Back to family traditions, did anyone have any weird ones?
[Message 13] Emily: Haha, weird? We used to have a family talent show every New Year's Eve. Some were... interesting.
[Message 14] Alex: A talent show! That’s hilarious. What was your talent, Emily?
[Message 15] Emily: Let's just say it involved a kazoo and a very off-key rendition of ""Happy Birthday.""
[Message 16] David: Sounds memorable! My brother always tried to juggle oranges, usually with disastrous results.
[Message 17] Jordan: Oranges! That's ambitious.
[Message 18] Chris: So, anyone have any big family gatherings coming up?
[Message 19] Alex: My cousin's wedding next month. Huge event.
[Message 20] Emily: Oh wow, weddings are crazy. Mine was... eventful.
[Message 21] David: Eventful how? If you're willing to share!
[Message 22] Emily: Let's just say the best man may or may not have tripped over the cake.
[Message 23] Jordan: Oh no! The cake!
[Message 24] Chris: Classic wedding mishap.
[Message 25] Alex: Speaking of cake, what's everyone's favorite?
[Message 26] David: Chocolate, hands down.
[Message 27] Emily: Red velvet. No contest.
[Message 28] Jordan: Carrot cake for me.
[Message 29] Chris: I’m a simple vanilla kind of guy.
[Message 30] Alex: I’m with you, Chris. Sometimes simple is best.
[Message 31] David: Agreed. Simple can be great. Thinking of my mom's apple pie now.
[Message 32] Emily: Apple pie! That's a family classic.
[Message 33] Jordan: My grandma makes the best apple pie. Secret ingredient is cinnamon.
[Message 34] Chris: Cinnamon is key!
[Message 35] Alex: Totally. Adds a nice warmth.
[Message 36] David: Anyone else got any secret ingredients they're willing to share?
[Message 37] Emily: My aunt uses a little bit of lemon zest in her chocolate chip cookies. Makes a huge difference.
[Message 38] Jordan: Ooh, lemon zest sounds amazing.
[Message 39] Chris: I'll have to try that!
[Message 40] Alex: Me too. Thanks for the tip, Emily!
[Message 41] David: Okay, slightly off topic, has anyone seen that new documentary about the national parks?
[Message 42] Emily: No, but I've heard good things! Which one?
[Message 43] Jordan: I think it's called ""America's Wild.""
[Message 44] Chris: I saw a trailer. Looks stunning.
[Message 45] Alex: I’m putting that on my watch list. Thanks!
[Message 46] David: You're welcome! Back to family, anyone planning any trips this year?
[Message 47] Emily: Thinking of visiting my sister in California.
[Message 48] Jordan: I'm hoping to go to Europe, but it's still in the planning stages.
[Message 49] Chris: I'm thinking of going back to my hometown. Haven't been in years.
[Message 50] Alex: I’d love to go to Japan someday.
[Message 51] David: Japan would be amazing.
[Message 52] Emily: Agreed. I've always wanted to visit.
[Message 53] Jordan: Same here!
[Message 54] Chris: Maybe we should all go together sometime!
[Message 55] Alex: That would be a fun trip!
[Message 56] David: I'm in!
[Message 57] Emily: Me too! Let's brainstorm ideas.
[Message 58] Jordan: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 59] Chris: Awesome. Maybe we can start a group chat for it.
[Message 60] Alex: Great idea, Chris!
[Message 61] David: Sounds good. I’ll create one.
[Message 62] Emily: Perfect!
[Message 63] Jordan: Thanks, David!
[Message 64] Chris: Appreciate it.
[Message 65] Alex: You're the best, David.
[Message 66] David: No problem! So, back to family traditions... any quirky games you played?
[Message 67] Emily: We used to play ""Sardines"" at my grandma's. Very chaotic.
[Message 68] Jordan: ""Sardines""! That's a classic.
[Message 69] Chris: We played ""Manhunt"" in the woods. Lots of fun, but also a bit scary.
[Message 70] Alex: Manhunt sounds intense!
[Message 71] David: My family always played charades. My dad was hilariously bad at it.
[Message 72] Emily: Charades is always a good time.
[Message 73] Jordan: Agreed! Especially when people get really into it.
[Message 74] Chris: So true.
[Message 75] Alex: What’s everyone having for dinner tonight? I’m drawing a blank.
[Message 76] David: I'm thinking of making pasta. Simple and easy.
[Message 77] Emily: I'm ordering pizza. Can't be bothered to cook.
[Message 78] Jordan: I'm having leftovers from last night. Chicken stir-fry.
[Message 79] Chris: I'm grilling some burgers.
[Message 80] Alex: Burgers sound delicious! I might steal your idea, Chris.
[Message 81] David: Burgers are always a good option.
[Message 82] Emily: Definitely. Especially on a grill.
[Message 83] Jordan: Makes me hungry just thinking about it.
[Message 84] Chris: Come on over, Alex! Got plenty.
[Message 85] Alex: Seriously? That's so kind of you, Chris!
[Message 86] David: That's very generous, Chris.
[Message 87] Emily: Yeah, that's really nice of you.
[Message 88] Jordan: You're a good friend, Chris.
[Message 89] Chris: Just trying to spread the burger love.
[Message 90] Alex: I might just take you up on that! Let me see if I can get away.
[Message 91] David: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 92] Emily: Enjoy your burgers, you two!
[Message 93] Jordan: Have fun!
[Message 94] Chris: Will do!
[Message 95] Alex: Thanks everyone! Back to family... any embarrassing childhood stories?
[Message 96] David: Oh boy, where do I even begin? I once accidentally called my teacher ""Mom.""
[Message 97] Emily: Haha! Classic. I tripped on stage during the school play.
[Message 98] Jordan: I wore mismatched shoes to school one day. Didn't realize until lunchtime.
[Message 99] Chris: I accidentally set off the fire alarm in my house while trying to make toast.
[Message 100] Alex: Whoa, Chris! That's a bit more than embarrassing!
[Message 101] David: Yeah, that's a story!
[Message 102] Emily: Definitely.
[Message 103] Jordan: Hope everything was okay!
[Message 104] Chris: Everything was fine, just a lot of smoke. My mom wasn't too happy.
[Message 105] Alex: I bet!
[Message 106] David: I can only imagine.
[Message 107] Emily: We all have those moments.
[Message 108] Jordan: So true.
[Message 109] Chris: Speaking of moments, has anyone seen that meteor shower that’s supposed to happen next week?
[Message 110] Alex: Oh yeah! I heard about that.
[Message 111] David: I forgot about that!
[Message 112] Emily: Where’s the best place to watch it?
[Message 113] Jordan: Somewhere dark, away from city lights.
[Message 114] Chris: I was thinking of going up to the mountains again.
[Message 115] Alex: That would be perfect! Maybe we can all go together.
[Message 116] David: That's a great idea, Alex!
[Message 117] Emily: Count me in!
[Message 118] Jordan: Sounds amazing!
[Message 119] Chris: Awesome. We can coordinate closer to the date.
[Message 120] Alex: Perfect!
[Message 121] David: Looking forward to it!
[Message 122] Emily: Me too!
[Message 123] Jordan: Thanks for the suggestion, Chris and Alex!
[Message 124] Chris: No problem!
[Message 125] Alex: Anytime! Thinking of taking some photos too.
[Message 126] David: Great!
[Message 127] Emily: I'd love to see them.
[Message 128] Jordan: Me too!
[Message 129] Chris: Looking forward to it.
[Message 130] Alex: I'll definitely share them. Okay, I really should get going. Got to pick up some groceries.
[Message 131] David: Alright, have a good night!
[Message 132] Emily: You too, Alex!
[Message 133] Jordan: Take care!
[Message 134] Chris: See ya!

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, Chloe. Shaken up. Crazy. Knew the guy, Ash, the corrections officer. Stubborn as a mule.

[Message 4] LIAM: Briefly. Left around 8 pm. Meeting with Ben about that landscaping job.

[Message 5] BEN: Hey Liam, just confirming you're still free tomorrow to discuss the new plants?

[Message 6] LIAM: Yep, Ben. See you then. Chloe was just asking about last night.

[Message 7] CHLOE: Sorry to pry. Just everyone’s on edge. It's just scary. I saw Dana buying some weird electrical stuff at the store yesterday afternoon.

[Message 8] LIAM: Electrical stuff? Dana? What for? She works at the library.

[Message 9] CHLOE: No idea. Said something about a ""project."" Kinda weirded me out, especially now.

[Message 10] DANA: Ugh, guys, stop texting me. I’m trying to work. And Liam, I saw you walking with a limp for a few days this week, what happened?

[Message 11] LIAM: Twisted my ankle hiking. Nothing major.

[Message 12] CHLOE: Maybe you should get that checked out Liam? Anyway Dana, what kinda project needs so much voltage?

[Message 13] DANA: It’s a sculpture, Chloe! A kinetic sculpture. Relax. The news is making everyone paranoid.

[Message 14] LIAM: Chloe, seriously, laying that on Dana seems a bit much.

[Message 15] CHLOE: I'm just saying, timing is sus, you know? And Dana always hated Ash; she got into it with him at the grocery store last week.

[Message 16] DANA: That's a lie! I didn't ""hate"" him. We disagreed about a parking space. Big deal.

[Message 17] BEN: Guys, can we keep this off the group chat? Really insensitive right now.

[Message 18] LIAM: Agreed, Ben. Chloe, maybe take a breath?

[Message 19] CHLOE: Fine, fine. I'm just freaked out. Hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 20] DANA: Me too. This whole thing is awful.

[Message 21] LIAM: The cops were asking about everyone who was at Campground that night. Did they talk to you, Dana?

[Message 22] DANA: Yeah, they asked a few questions. Standard procedure, I guess. I told them I was home all evening working on my sculpture.

[Message 23] CHLOE: Liam, did you mention seeing Ben around 8pm when you left Campground? It may help with the investigation.

[Message 24] LIAM: Yeah, I did. Look, I need to go. This is making me sick to my stomach.

[Message 25] BEN: Chloe, why you being so nosey? Just let the police do their job.

[Message 26] CHLOE: Nosey? Someone died, Ben! And someone needs to pay for that

[Message 12] Jamie: ""Alex! Over here by the fountain! With the absurdly large pretzel.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Haha, I see it! Pretzels are essential sustenance for crafting discussions.""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""Precisely! So, sculpting, you said?""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Yes! I'm working on a piece inspired by the Schuylkill River. Thinking clay for this one.""
[Message 16] Jamie: ""Ooh, ambitious! I've always admired sculptors. So much skill involved.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""It's a lot of fun! And frustrating sometimes. What about you? Any crafting projects on the horizon?""
[Message 18] Jamie: ""Actually, I’ve been meaning to get back into bookbinding. Haven't done it in ages.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Bookbinding! That's so cool! I've always wanted to try that.""
[Message 20] Jamie: ""It's surprisingly relaxing. And you end up with beautiful, personalized books.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""I bet! Do you need any special equipment?""
[Message 22] Jamie: ""A few basic tools, yes. Bone folder, bookbinder's needle, linen thread... I can show you sometime.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""I would love that! Maybe we could have a crafting session together?""
[Message 24] Jamie: ""Absolutely! That would be great. I'm always up for learning new things too.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Perfect! We could swap techniques. I can show you some clay sculpting basics.""
[Message 26] Jamie: ""Deal! So, back to your Schuylkill River sculpture... what kind of clay are you thinking?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Probably earthenware. It's pretty forgiving, and I like the earthy tones.""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""Good choice. I always struggle with choosing materials. So many options!""
[Message 29] Alex: ""I know, right? It can be overwhelming. Have you ever tried polymer clay?""
[Message 30] Jamie: ""Once, for a small project. Found it a bit fiddly, but I might give it another go.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""It can be tricky. But it's great for detail work. Anyway, enough about clay! Let's talk about this pretzel. It's huge!""
[Message 32] Jamie: ""Haha, I told you! Worth every penny though. Fueling my creative spirit.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""I believe it! So, any good books you've read lately that might inspire some bookbinding projects?""
[Message 34] Jamie: ""Actually, yes! I just finished 'The Night Circus' by Erin Morgenstern. Beautiful imagery, would look amazing with intricate binding.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Ooh, I've heard of that one! I'll have to check it out. Maybe I can sculpt a character from it!""
[Message 36] Jamie: ""That would be incredible! We could have a whole collaborative project going.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""I love that idea! Okay, we need to plan this. When are you free next week?""
[Message 38] Jamie: ""Let me check my calendar... How about Wednesday afternoon?""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Wednesday works for me! Where should we meet?""
[Message 40] Jamie: ""Hmm, maybe your place? Since you're the sculptor, you probably have more space and supplies.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Sounds good! I'll clear off the dining room table. Plenty of room there.""
[Message 42] Jamie: ""Perfect! I'll bring some of my bookbinding supplies.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Wonderful! I'm already excited. This is going to be so much fun.""
[Message 44] Jamie: ""Me too! It's been too long since I've done any serious crafting.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Well, get ready to dust off those bookbinding skills! We're going to make some magic happen.""
[Message 46] Jamie: ""I'm ready! So, are you thinking of adding any specific details to your river sculpture? Like, little boats or wildlife?""
[Message 47] Alex: ""That's a great idea! Maybe a tiny replica of the sculling team that practices there.""
[Message 48] Jamie: ""Oh, that would be adorable! And very Philadelphia.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Exactly! I want to capture the essence of the river, you know?""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""I totally get it. It's all about capturing the feeling and the atmosphere.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Precisely! So, what kind of binding are you thinking for 'The Night Circus'?""
[Message 52] Jamie: ""Maybe a full leather binding with intricate tooling. Something that reflects the magical atmosphere of the book.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Ooh, fancy! I can picture it already. You're so talented.""
[Message 54] Jamie: ""Don't sell yourself short! Your sculptures are amazing. I saw that piece you did of the cat last year. Stunning!""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Oh, Mittens! She was a good muse. Always sleeping in the sun.""
[Message 56] Jamie: ""A perfect subject! Speaking of subjects, are you thinking of adding any color to your clay?""
[Message 57] Alex: ""I might use some underglazes to add subtle hints of color. Nothing too vibrant.""
[Message 58] Jamie: ""That sounds lovely. A natural, muted palette.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Yes, exactly! I want it to feel like the river on a cloudy day.""
[Message 60] Jamie: ""You're really thinking this through! I'm impressed.""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Well, I have been thinking about it for a while now. It's been brewing in my mind.""
[Message 62] Jamie: ""I know the feeling. Sometimes the best ideas take time to develop.""
[Message 63] Alex: ""True! So, what kind of thread are you planning to use for your bookbinding?""
[Message 64] Jamie: ""Probably linen thread. It's strong and durable, and it comes in a variety of colors.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Good choice. I've heard that linen thread is the best for bookbinding.""
[Message 66] Jamie: ""It is! It's been used for centuries. Proven quality.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""That's amazing! I love learning about the history of crafts.""
[Message 68] Jamie: ""Me too! It's fascinating to see how techniques have evolved over time.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Absolutely! So, should we exchange numbers so we can coordinate on Wednesday?""
[Message 70] Jamie: ""Good idea! My number is 555-123-4567.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Got it! Mine is 555-987-6543.""
[Message 72] Jamie: ""Perfect! I'll text you on Wednesday morning to confirm.""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Sounds good! I'm really looking forward to it.""
[Message 74] Jamie: ""Me too! It's going to be a great day of crafting.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""Definitely! And maybe we can even finish our projects, or at least make some good progress.""
[Message 76] Jamie: ""That would be amazing! But even if we don't finish, it'll still be fun to work on them together.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Agreed! It's all about the process, not just the end result.""
[Message 78] Jamie: ""Exactly! And the company.""
[Message 79] Alex: ""Absolutely! Crafting is always more fun with friends.""
[Message 80] Jamie: ""Couldn't agree more! So, are you thinking of adding any embellishments to your sculpture, like beads or stones?""
[Message 81] Alex: ""I hadn't thought of that, but that's a great idea! Maybe some small glass beads to represent the water droplets.""
[Message 82] Jamie: ""Ooh, that would be beautiful! It would add a touch of sparkle.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Yes, exactly! I love adding little details that catch the light.""
[Message 84] Jamie: ""Me too! It's all about adding those little touches that make the piece unique.""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Precisely! So, what kind of tools do you need for bookbinding besides the needle and thread?""
[Message 86] Jamie: ""A bone folder, which is used to crease the paper and make sharp folds, a cutting mat, a ruler, and a craft knife.""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Okay, that sounds like a manageable amount of tools. I think I can handle that.""
[Message 88] Jamie: ""It's not too complicated, I promise! And I'll bring all the necessary supplies.""
[Message 89] Alex: ""Wonderful! I really appreciate that. You're a lifesaver.""
[Message 90] Jamie: ""No problem at all! I'm happy to share my knowledge and supplies.""
[Message 91] Alex: ""You're the best! So, have you been to any good art exhibits lately?""
[Message 92] Jamie: ""Not recently, no. But I've been meaning to check out the new exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.""
[Message 93] Alex: ""Oh, which one? The Impressionists exhibit?""
[Message 94] Jamie: ""Yes, that's the one! Have you seen it?""
[Message 95] Alex: ""No, but I've heard it's amazing. We should go sometime!""
[Message 96] Jamie: ""That's a great idea! We could make it a crafting and culture day.""
[Message 97] Alex: ""I love that! We could visit the museum in the morning and then craft in the afternoon.""
[Message 98] Jamie: ""Perfect! We'll have to plan that soon.""
[Message 99] Alex: ""Definitely! So, what time should I expect you on Wednesday?""
[Message 100] Jamie: ""How about around 1 pm?""
[Message 101] Alex: ""That sounds perfect! I'll see you then.""
[Message 102] Jamie: ""Great! I'm really looking forward to it.""
[Message 103] Alex: ""Me too! It's going to be a wonderful day of crafting and creativity.""
[Message 104] Jamie: ""Absolutely! And maybe we can even try some new techniques together.""
[Message 105] Alex: ""I'm always up for trying new things! It's how we learn and grow.""
[Message 106] Jamie: ""Exactly! And it keeps things interesting.""
[Message 107] Alex: ""Definitely! So, what's your favorite thing about bookbinding?""
[Message 108] Jamie: ""I love the tactile nature of it. Working with paper and thread, and creating something beautiful and functional.""
[Message 109] Alex: ""That sounds so satisfying! I can see why you enjoy it so much.""
[Message 110] Jamie: ""It is! It's a very meditative and calming activity.""
[Message 111] Alex: ""I can imagine. Sculpting can be the same way. It's a great way to relax and unwind.""
[Message 112] Jamie: ""Definitely! It's a great way to express yourself and create something unique.""
[Message 113] Alex: ""Absolutely! And it's so rewarding to see your creation come to life.""
[Message 114] Jamie: ""I agree! It's a feeling like no other.""
[Message 115] Alex: ""So true! Well, I should probably head home now. It's getting late.""
[Message 116] Jamie: ""Okay! It was great talking to you, Alex.""
[Message 117] Alex: ""You too, Jamie! I'm so excited for Wednesday.""
[Message 118] Jamie: ""Me too! It's going to be a blast.""
[Message 119] Alex: ""Definitely! I'll see you then.""
[Message 120] Jamie: ""See you! Have a safe drive home.""
[Message 121] Alex: ""Thanks! You too. And thanks for the pretzel! It was delicious.""
[Message 122] Jamie: ""You're welcome! I'm glad you enjoyed it. Crafting fuel, remember?""
[Message 123] Alex: ""Haha, exactly! Okay, bye!""
[Message 124] Jamie: ""Bye!""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Just got home. Feeling inspired!""
[Message 126] Jamie: ""Awesome! Me too. Already thinking about the bookbinding.""
[Message 127] Alex: ""I'm sketching out some ideas for the river sculpture. Thinking of adding a small bridge.""
[Message 128] Jamie: ""That's a great idea! Which bridge?""
[Message 129] Alex: ""The South Street Bridge. It's so iconic.""
[Message 130] Jamie: ""Perfect! It'll really add to the sense of place.""
[Message 131] Alex: ""Exactly! Okay, time for dinner. I'm starving.""
[Message 132] Jamie: ""Me too! What are you having?""
[Message 133] Alex: ""Probably just a salad. Nothing too fancy.""
[Message 134] Jamie: ""Sounds good! I'm thinking of ordering pizza.""
[Message 135] Alex: ""Pizza sounds amazing! Enjoy!""
[Message 136] Jamie: ""Thanks! You too. Talk to you soon!""
[Message 137] Alex: ""Talk to you soon! Goodnight!""
[Message 138] Jamie: ""Goodnight!""
[Message 139] Alex: ""Quick question, do you prefer tea or coffee when we're crafting?""
[Message 140] Jamie: ""Oh, good question! Tea, definitely. Green tea if you have it.""
[Message 141] Alex: ""Perfect! I have plenty of green tea. Consider it done.""
[Message 142] Jamie: ""You're the best! Really looking forward to Wednesday!""
[Message 143] Alex: ""Me too! Getting all my sculpting tools ready.""
[Message 144] Jamie: ""Excellent! I'll gather my bookbinding supplies tomorrow.""
[Message 145] Alex: ""Sounds like a plan! Can't wait!""
[Message 146] Jamie: ""Me neither! Sleep well!""

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, terrible. Two people, right?

[Message 3] Kai: Yeah. I heard it was the bartender, Mark, and… Alex?

[Message 4] Chloe: Ugh, so awful. I knew Alex from the activist meetups. Such a kind person.

[Message 5] Liam: Poor Mark too. He always seemed ambitious, trying to get promoted.

[Message 6] Noah: Ambition can be a dangerous thing. What a waste.

[Message 7] Chloe: Did they say what happened?

[Message 8] Kai: Something about a falling object…crazy.

[Message 9] Liam: Falling object? Like an accident?

[Message 10] Noah: Doesn't sound like an accident to me.

[Message 11] Chloe: I don't know…things fall all the time at subway stations.

[Message 12] Kai: True. But two people at once?

[Message 13] Liam: I saw Sarah buying Falling object (dropped from height) at the store this morning. Weird.

[Message 14] Chloe: Oh god. Sarah? Why?

[Message 15] Kai: Did she seem upset or anything, Liam?

[Message 16] Liam: Now that I think about it, yeah. She looked stressed.

[Message 17] Noah: Stressed enough to…do something like that?

[Message 18] Chloe: I just can't believe it. I saw Mark talking to Sarah right before he went over there.

[Message 19] Kai: Talking about what?

[Message 20] Chloe: I don’t know, I couldn’t hear. It seemed heated, though.

[Message 21] Liam: What if she just forgot something?

[Message 22] Noah: Yeah, like a murder weapon.

[Message 23] Kai: Let's not jump to conclusions. The police will figure it out.

[Message 24] Chloe: I heard they're going away for a long time for this, whoever did it.

[Message 25] Liam: Deservedly so.

[Message 26] Noah: Remember that time Mark fired Sarah?

[Message 27] Kai: Yeah, but that was months ago.

[Message 28] Chloe: People hold grudges. Sarah always hated 9.  Bartender .

[Message 29] Liam: True. But did she really mean him any harm?

[Message 30] Kai: We don't know what anyone is capable of.

[Message 31] Noah: The act happened at Dusk, right?

[Message 32] Chloe: Yeah, I think so. Why?

[Message 33] Noah: Just checking. I was at home all evening so can’t help.

[Message 34] Liam: I was too, binge-watching that show.

[Message 35] Kai: I was at the gym.

[Message 36] Chloe: I was working late. Thank god I wasn't near the station.

[Message 37] Kai: They should have called 911 sooner, maybe they could have been saved!

[Message 38] Liam: Maybe it was an attempted robbery gone wrong?

[Message 39] Noah: Maybe. Or maybe someone just wanted them gone. She intended to kill them when she bought that Falling object (dropped from height).

[Message 40] Chloe: Stop it, Noah. You're making me nervous.

[Message 41] Kai: Let’s wait for the police report.

[Message 42] Liam: Anyone know if Mark had any enemies? He was ambitious, which could make people jealous.

[Message 43] Chloe: He was always talking about getting out of Monroe. Maybe someone didn’t want him to leave?

[Message 44] Kai: That's a stretch, Chloe.

[Message 45] Noah: Or maybe he was about to expose someone's secret and had to be silenced.

[Message 46] Chloe: Whose secret? And how would you even know that, Noah?

[Message 47] Noah: Just a thought. People have secrets, Chloe.

[Message 48] Liam: This whole thing is just so messed up.

[Message 49] Kai: Agreed. Let's all just try to stay calm until we know more.

[Message 50] Chloe: Yeah, okay. Maybe we should all get together later this week? Comfort food?",1,

[Message 4] Riley: ""That's amazing, Jordan. My dog, Buster, just sleeps. He's boring.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Buster probably appreciates the simple things, Riley. Maybe you should try his method.""

[Message 8] Riley: ""I'm thinking of trying that new bakery downtown. Heard good things.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Oh, which one? The one on Classen?""
[Message 10] Riley: ""Yeah! Small Hours, I think it's called.""
[Message 11] Jamie: ""Small Hours? Sounds lovely. Let me know how it is!""
[Message 12] Jordan: ""Back to pets - I caught my cat trying to open the fridge last night. Determined little thing.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Wow! My old dog used to do that. Got quite a surprise opening the door to find him face-to-face with the yogurt.""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""Hahaha! That's a great image.""
[Message 15] Riley: ""Buster just barks at squirrels. Unoriginal.""
[Message 16] Alex: ""Squirrels are a classic enemy, Riley. Buster's just keeping things traditional.""
[Message 17] Jordan: ""True! Anyone ever tried one of those squirrel-proof bird feeders? Do they actually work?""
[Message 18] Jamie: ""I've heard mixed reviews, Jordan. Some swear by them, others say the squirrels just get more creative.""
[Message 19] Riley: ""I'm suddenly invested in squirrel-proof bird feeders.""
[Message 20] Alex: ""Me too! This is important information.""
[Message 21] Jordan: ""Okay, I'll do some research and report back.""
[Message 22] Jamie: ""Thanks, Jordan! You're a lifesaver... for the birds, at least.""
[Message 23] Riley: ""My friend went on a first date last night. It was at a fancy restaurant, apparently.""
[Message 24] Alex: ""Ooh, how'd it go?""
[Message 25] Riley: ""Said the guy spent the whole time talking about himself. Classic.""
[Message 26] Jamie: ""Ugh. First date pet peeve.""
[Message 27] Jordan: ""Definitely. Self-absorption is a dealbreaker.""
[Message 28] Alex: ""Agreed. Back to pets, maybe we should all just bring our animals on first dates. Instant personality assessment.""
[Message 29] Jamie: ""I love that idea, Alex! If my cat approves, he's a keeper.""
[Message 30] Riley: ""Buster would probably just eat all the food.""
[Message 31] Jordan: ""My cat would hide under the table the entire time.""
[Message 32] Alex: ""Hey, a quiet date could be nice for a change!""
[Message 33] Jamie: ""True! A little mystery.""
[Message 34] Riley: ""So, squirrel-proof bird feeders and first date animal assessments... we've covered a lot of ground today.""

[Message 39] Jordan: ""I think Buster's onto something.""
[Message 40] Alex: ""Speaking of Buster, maybe he needs a friend to play with. He might be bored.""
[Message 41] Jamie: ""A friend for Buster! That's a thought.""
[Message 42] Riley: ""He gets plenty of walks and attention. He's just naturally lazy.""
[Message 43] Jordan: ""My cat would probably be jealous if I got another pet.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Cats are notoriously territorial.""
[Message 45] Jamie: ""Definitely. Whiskers would stage a coup.""

219,"Here's a 50-message text conversation designed to meet your requirements:

[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey, you hear about what happened at Taxi Stand?

[Message 2] MAYA: OMG, Chloe! No! What? I just got off work.

[Message 3] CHLOE: Double homicide. Early Morning. Two people. It's all over the news.

[Message 4] MAYA: Seriously? That's insane! Who were they?

[Message 5] CHLOE: Some Drug Dealer named Alex and a Social Worker named Jamie. I think.

[Message 6] MAYA: Alex...Jamie... Never heard of them. So awful.

[Message 7] CHLOE: Yeah. Tampa's getting scary. You walking home okay?

[Message 8] MAYA: My neighbor, Ben, picked me up. Thanks, though! He's a lifesaver.

[Message 9] CHLOE: Good. Stay safe. I’m supposed to meet with Ben for drinks this week, I will probably cancel it.

[Message 10] MAYA: You should! I would. It's unsettling. Did they say how they died?

[Message 11] CHLOE: Not exactly. Something about a needle? The news is vague.

[Message 12] MAYA: A needle? That sounds...intentional.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Right? That’s what I thought. Someone really hated them. Ben mentioned he knew Alex, I think.

[Message 14] MAYA: Maybe he knows something? What did he say about Alex?

[Message 15] CHLOE: Just that he “dealt with him” once. Sounded like a business thing. Nothing serious.

[Message 16] MAYA: Oh. Well, that's still... something. Weird.

[Message 17] CHLOE: Right? Anyway, I gotta go. Dinner's ready. Talk later.

[Message 18] MAYA: Sure. Stay safe!

[Message 19] BEN: Hey Maya, just checking in. Chloe seemed really shaken up.

[Message 20] MAYA: Yeah, she told me about Alex and Jamie. It's horrible.

[Message 21] BEN: It is. I can’t believe it. I’ve known Alex for a while… it’s difficult to process.

[Message 22] MAYA: Chloe said you ""dealt with"" Alex once? What was that about?

[Message 23] BEN: Oh, that? It was nothing. Just a minor disagreement over some parking space issue. A long time ago.

[Message 24] MAYA: Oh, okay. Just seems strange now, you know? Given everything.

[Message 25] BEN: Yeah, I get it. Look, can we talk about something else? This is stressing me out.

[Message 26] MAYA: Sure. Sorry. How’s your mom doing?

[Message 27] BEN: She's better, thanks for asking. The doctor said she needs to rest. This Alex situation is really making me feel down, you know? Like, what's the point of all this?

[Message 28] MAYA: Yeah, it’s a lot to take in. You seem more upset than I would expect for just knowing the guy for a while.

[Message 29] BEN: Of course I am upset! I have to take some medicine for my Limp when walking, and she was getting the medicine, this will make it very difficult to get the meds in time. You know, just the general principle is bad. Anyway, I’m gonna watch some TV and try to relax. Talk soon.

[Message 30] MAYA: Okay. Feel better.

[Message 31] CHLOE: Hey! I saw Ben at that pharmacy near Taxi Stand earlier.

[Message 32] MAYA: Really? What was he doing there?

[Message 33] CHLOE: Just picking up a prescription, I guess. He looked really stressed.

[Message 34] MAYA: He mentioned his Limp when walking was acting up. Maybe that's it.

[Message 35] CHLOE: Maybe. He was there really Early Morning. Like, before anything opened.

[Message 36] MAYA: Weird. You think he’s hiding something?

[Message 37] CHLOE: I don’t know. It’s just… everything’s weird now, isn’t it?

[Message 38] MAYA: Tell me about it. This whole thing is just a nightmare.

[Message 39] CHLOE: Hey, do you remember Sarah from the office? She knew Jamie pretty well, I think.

[Message 40] MAYA: Sarah? Yeah, vaguely. Why?

[Message 41] CHLOE: I just remember her saying Jamie was really withdrawn lately, like something was bothering them.

[Message 42] MAYA: Oh. Maybe it was work stress. Social Worker is a tough job.

[Message 43] CHLOE: Could be. Or maybe… something else. What if I want to intended get rid of someone ?

[Message 44] MAYA: Chloe, you’re scaring me. Don’t say things like that.

[Message 45] CHLOE: Sorry. Just thinking out loud. This whole thing is making me paranoid. I saw Ben buying Administering a lethal injection at the store the other day.

[Message 46] MAYA: You what?! Administering a lethal injection? Are you sure?

[Message 47] CHLOE: I'm positive. He said it was for a school project. But now I am unsure, I need to take that back!

[Message 48] MAYA: School project? That is the lamest excuse I’ve ever heard. I don't think he will get the death penalty but is enough to put him in jail.

[Message 49] MAYA: Okay, Chloe. I think we need to call the police. This is too much.

[Message 50] CHLOE: Okay. You're right. This has gone too far.",1,
220,"[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey Liam, you ok? You seemed off at the party.
[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, just tired. Long week. How was the rest of your night?
[Message 3] CHLOE: Pretty chill. Met a girl named Sarah. Works at that dry cleaner near the stadium.
[Message 4] LIAM: Oh, cool.
[Message 5] ANNA: Hey Chloe, you hear about what happened at the dry cleaner?
[Message 6] CHLOE: No, what's up?
[Message 7] ANNA: Some girl got shot there last night.
[Message 8] CHLOE: WHAT?! Seriously? Dry Cleaner?
[Message 9] ANNA: Yeah, it's all over the news. Scary stuff.
[Message 10] CHLOE: That’s crazy. I was just talking to someone who works there.
[Message 11] ANNA: Who?
[Message 12] CHLOE: This girl Sarah I met at the party.
[Message 13] ANNA: Wow, small world. Poor girl.
[Message 14] LIAM: (To CHLOE) You still up?
[Message 15] CHLOE: Yeah, just talking to Anna about that shooting.
[Message 16] LIAM: Shooting? Where?
[Message 17] CHLOE: At the dry cleaner.
[Message 18] LIAM: Damn, that's messed up. Columbia's getting rough.
[Message 19] CHLOE: Tell me about it. Hey, did you see Mrs. Davison yell at Mark yesterday?
[Message 20] LIAM: Haha, yeah. He deserved it.
[Message 21] ANNA: I wonder who did it.
[Message 22] CHLOE: No idea. Probably some random act of violence.
[Message 23] ANNA: They'll catch them. Hope they get the death penalty.
[Message 24] LIAM: (To CHLOE) You going to class tomorrow?
[Message 25] CHLOE: Yeah, ugh. Early one too.
[Message 26] LIAM: Me too. See ya there.
[Message 27] CHLOE: Later.
[Message 28] JAKE: Yo Anna, you seen Marcus around?
[Message 29] ANNA: Nah, haven't seen him all day. Why?
[Message 30] JAKE: He owes me money. Keeps dodging me.
[Message 31] ANNA: That sucks. Have you tried calling?
[Message 32] JAKE: Yeah, no answer.
[Message 33] ANNA: Maybe he's busy with work.
[Message 34] JAKE: He better be working on getting my money.
[Message 35] ANNA: Relax, he'll pay you back. Probably.
[Message 36] JAKE: (To MARCUS) Where you been man?
[Message 37] MARCUS: Chilling. What's up?
[Message 38] JAKE: You know what's up. My money, dude.
[Message 39] MARCUS: I told you, I'm good for it. I just need a little more time.
[Message 40] JAKE: Time's up, Marcus.
[Message 41] MARCUS: Look, I'm trying to figure things out. This whole thing with Emily…
[Message 42] JAKE: Emily? Who's Emily?
[Message 43] MARCUS: Nevermind. Just…give me a few more days, alright?
[Message 44] JAKE: Fine. But if I don't have it by Friday…
[Message 45] MARCUS: You'll have it. I promise.
[Message 46] ANNA: (To CHLOE) Heard any updates on the shooting?
[Message 47] CHLOE: Not really. Just that they're investigating.
[Message 48] ANNA: Creepy. Makes you think twice about walking alone at night.
[Message 49] CHLOE: Seriously.
[Message 50] MARCUS: (To SARAH) Hey, can we talk? It’s important.
[Message 51] SARAH: What's up? You seem stressed.
[Message 52] MARCUS: It's about… about what happened.
[Message 53] SARAH: What are you talking about? I don't know anything.
[Message 54] MARCUS: Don't play dumb. You were there. You saw it.
[Message 55] SARAH: Saw what? I was at work all night.
[Message 56] MARCUS: You need to keep your mouth shut, Sarah. For your own good.
[Message 57] SARAH: Are you threatening me?
[Message 58] MARCUS: No, I'm warning you. This is serious. Very serious.
[Message 59] SARAH: I don't like this. I'm going.
[Message 60] MARCUS: Don't you dare walk away from me!
[Message 61] SARAH: (To ANNA) Hey, do you know Marcus?
[Message 62] ANNA: Yeah, I know him. Why?
[Message 63] SARAH: He's acting really weird. He was basically threatening me.
[Message 64] ANNA: What? What did he say?
[Message 65] SARAH: Something about seeing something, and keeping my mouth shut. It's freaking me out.
[Message 66] ANNA: About the shooting?
[Message 67] SARAH: I guess so. I don't know what's going on.
[Message 68] ANNA: That’s messed up. You should tell the police.
[Message 69] SARAH: I don't want to get involved.
[Message 70] ANNA: But if he's involved…
[Message 71] SARAH: I don't know! Maybe he's just stressed out about something else.
[Message 72] ANNA: Maybe. But be careful, okay?
[Message 73] SARAH: I will. Thanks.
[Message 74] MARCUS: (To CHLOE) Hey, you know Sarah, right?
[Message 75] CHLOE: Yeah, met her at Liam's party. Why?
[Message 76] MARCUS: She works at the dry cleaner, right?
[Message 77] CHLOE: Yeah. What about it?
[Message 78] MARCUS: Nothing. Just curious.
[Message 79] CHLOE: You seem weird. Is everything okay?
[Message 80] MARCUS: Fine. Just tired.
[Message 81] CHLOE: Okay… well, let me know if you need anything.
[Message 82] MARCUS: Will do. Thanks.
[Message 83] LIAM: (To SARAH) Hey, it's Liam from the party. How are you?
[Message 84] SARAH: Oh, hey! I’m okay. A little shaken up, to be honest.
[Message 85] LIAM: Yeah, I heard about what happened at your work. That’s awful.
[Message 86] SARAH: It is. I can't believe it.
[Message 87] LIAM: Is there anything I can do?
[Message 88] SARAH: Just keep me in your thoughts, I guess.
[Message 89] LIAM: Definitely. Hey, I was wondering…did you see anything weird that night?
[Message 90] SARAH: Weird? What do you mean?
[Message 91] LIAM: Like, anyone acting suspicious? Anyone you didn't recognize hanging around?
[Message 92] SARAH: I don't know… it was busy. I was just trying to do my job.
[Message 93] LIAM: Right, right. Sorry. Just trying to help.
[Message 94] SARAH: I appreciate it. I really do.
[Message 95] CHLOE: (To LIAM) Why were you asking Sarah about suspicious people?
[Message 96] LIAM: Just trying to be helpful. She seemed really scared.
[Message 97] CHLOE: You seemed really interested.
[Message 98] LIAM: What's that supposed to mean?
[Message 99] CHLOE: Nothing. Just an observation.
[Message 100] LIAM: Whatever.
[Message 101] ANNA: (To MARCUS) Sarah told me you were acting strange. What’s going on?
[Message 102] MARCUS: She's exaggerating. I just… I might have seen something that night.
[Message 103] ANNA: Saw what?
[Message 104] MARCUS: I don't want to talk about it.
[Message 105] ANNA: Marcus, you have to tell me. This is serious. If you saw something, you need to go to the police.
[Message 106] MARCUS: I can't. I'll get in trouble.
[Message 107] ANNA: Trouble for what? What did you do?
[Message 108] MARCUS: I didn't do anything! Just… I was there. Okay? I was there and I panicked.
[Message 109] ANNA: Panicked about what?
[Message 110] MARCUS: Just leave it alone, Anna. Please.
[Message 111] JAKE: (To ANNA) You seen Marcus? Still owes me money. I intended to have it by today.
[Message 112] ANNA: He’s acting strange. Something is going on with him. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 113] JAKE: What you mean?
[Message 114] ANNA: Never mind
[Message 115] CHLOE: (To LIAM) Hey, are you free?
[Message 116] LIAM: Yeah, why? What's up?
[Message 117] CHLOE: Want to grab a coffee? I need to talk.
[Message 118] LIAM: Sure, where?
[Message 119] CHLOE: How about that place near the stadium?
[Message 120] LIAM: Okay. See you in a bit.
[Message 121] ANNA: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 122] JAKE: Exactly, the manager deserves it.
[Message 123] MARCUS: (To ANNA) You won’t tell the police about me, right?
[Message 124] ANNA: I dont know Marcus, you Knew this would happen, you have to tell them!

221,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone! Noon already. How's the beachfront treating you? I'm stuck in traffic, running late.
[Message 2] Jordan: It's gorgeous, Alex! Sun's out, but there's a nice breeze. We're claiming our crafting spot.
[Message 3] Sam: Yeah, setting up the table now. Bring the snacks, Alex!
[Message 4] Alex: On it! ETA 15 minutes. So, crafting today...still leaning towards the seashell ornaments?
[Message 5] Jordan: That's the plan! I brought extra glitter this time. Prepare for sparkle overload.
[Message 6] Sam: Glitter is always a good idea. I'm thinking of trying to make a little mosaic too, if I can find enough colorful shells.
[Message 7] Alex: Ooh, a mosaic! Ambitious! I'm sticking with the ornaments for now, my crafting skills are...limited.
[Message 8] Jordan: Don't sell yourself short, Alex! We'll help you. Besides, the point is to relax and have fun.
[Message 9] Sam: Exactly. No pressure to create a masterpiece.
[Message 10] Alex: Thanks, guys! Appreciate the encouragement. By the way, anyone seen that documentary about weaving with seaweed?
[Message 11] Jordan: Weaving with seaweed? That sounds fascinating! Where did you hear about it?
[Message 12] Sam: Never heard of that! I'm intrigued though.
[Message 13] Alex: I saw it on some streaming service, I think. ""Ocean Threads"" maybe? I'll have to check.
[Message 14] Jordan: Add it to the list! Speaking of lists, have you guys thought about travel plans for October yet?
[Message 15] Sam: I haven't really. October is still a ways off, right?
[Message 16] Alex: It is, but Jordan's always on top of things! I was thinking of maybe going somewhere with hiking trails.
[Message 17] Jordan: Hiking sounds great! I was thinking something with fall foliage, maybe New England?
[Message 18] Sam: New England in the fall would be beautiful. But expensive!
[Message 19] Alex: True, New England is pricey. Maybe somewhere closer and less touristy?
[Message 20] Jordan: We could look into the Ozarks. Lots of hiking and beautiful scenery.
[Message 21] Sam: Ozarks sounds interesting. I’ll do some research tonight. Okay, back to crafting! Alex, you almost here?
[Message 22] Alex: Almost! Just parked. Grabbed some extra iced tea too.
[Message 23] Jordan: You're a lifesaver! It's getting a little warm.
[Message 24] Sam: Iced tea sounds perfect. So glad you're almost here, Alex. I need a break from shell sorting.
[Message 25] Alex: Shell sorting is a crucial task! I'll be there in five minutes. Need help carrying anything?
[Message 26] Jordan: I think we're good, thanks! Just bring your sparkling personality.
[Message 27] Sam: Yeah, just yourself and the iced tea! Welcome to Beachfront crafting central!
[Message 28] Alex: You guys are the best. See you in a sec!
[Message 29] Jordan: Yay! Crafting time!

222,"[Message 1] Kai: Hey, have you heard about what happened at the Taxi Stand?

[Message 2] Jordan: Vaguely. Something about a Poisoning via inhalation?

[Message 3] Kai: Yeah, horrible. Poor 7.  Activist... Apparently, she was found Dusk.

[Message 4] Alex: Dusk? That's when I saw Jesse leave that area. Coincidence?

[Message 5] Jordan: Jesse? He wouldn't do something like that. He's always seemed chill.

[Message 6] Alex: Chill? He always hated 7.  Activist, though, ever since she supported that protest against his company. Pure Mens Rea.

[Message 7] Kai: Whoa, okay, slow down. Hating someone doesn’t make him a killer.

[Message 8] Jordan: Exactly! Besides, I heard Marie was arguing with 7.  Activist earlier that day.

[Message 9] Alex: Marie? About what?

[Message 10] Jordan: Something about unpaid debts. I overheard them near the coffee shop. But Marie wouldn't, she's a sweetheart.

[Message 11] Kai: This is awful. Did they find anything? Any clues?

[Message 12] Alex: I heard they found some kind of inhaler. Empty.

[Message 13] Jordan: An inhaler? Lots of people have those in Nashville, especially with the allergies right now.

[Message 14] Kai: True. But still… poor 7.  Activist. She was just trying to make a difference.

[Message 15] Alex: Making a difference and ruffling feathers. Jesse always said she was asking for trouble.

[Message 16] Jordan: That's a horrible thing to say, Alex! Even if he did say it.

[Message 17] Kai: Agreed. Let's not jump to conclusions. The police will figure it out.

[Message 18] Alex: Hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 19] Jordan: It's probably some random act of violence, you know? Wrong place, wrong time. I hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 20] Kai: Let’s hope so. Hey, are either of you free for coffee tomorrow? Need to get my mind off this.

[Message 21] Alex: I'm in. Need a distraction too.

[Message 22] Jordan: Me too. See you both then.

[Message 23] Kai: Great. So, back to the Taxi Stand... any more news?

[Message 24] Alex: Just rumors. Someone said Marie was buying some weird stuff at the store that day. Poisoning via inhalation, specifically.

[Message 25] Jordan: Seriously? She was probably just buying stuff for her garden!

[Message 26] Kai: Guys, let’s not spread gossip. Wait for the official investigation. This could have been an intended poisoning.

[Message 27] Alex: Right, right. Just saying what I heard.

[Message 28] Jordan: I saw Jesse trying to fix something in his car that day. Could be relevant? He was getting pretty frustrated. Actus Reus?

[Message 29] Kai: Maybe. Or maybe his car was just being a pain. Nashville traffic can do that to anyone.

[Message 30] Alex: True. Speaking of cars, I need to get mine serviced. Anyone know a good mechanic?

[Message 31] Jordan: Try Tony's on Demonbreun. He's honest.

[Message 32] Kai: Okay, thanks. Back to Jesse and Marie... is there anything else either of you remember? Anything at all?

[Message 33] Alex: Just that Jesse seemed unusually quiet lately. Like he was planning something. Causation?

[Message 34] Jordan: Maybe he was just stressed about work. We all get stressed.

[Message 35] Kai: I guess so. Well, see you both tomorrow for coffee. Let's try to talk about something else, okay?",1,
223,"[Message 1] Kai: ""Morning everyone! How's everyone feeling today?""
[Message 2] Leo: ""Morning Kai! I'm doing pretty good, just had my usual green smoothie.""
[Message 3] River: ""Morning! Coffee first, then assessment of my feeling. Jury's still out.""
[Message 4] Kai: ""Green smoothie, nice! I need to get back into that habit. What's in yours, Leo?""
[Message 5] Leo: ""Spinach, banana, almond milk, chia seeds, and a little ginger. Gives me a good boost.""
[Message 6] River: ""Sounds healthy! I’m more of a bacon and eggs kind of person, but maybe I should try something like that occasionally.""
[Message 7] Kai: ""Bacon and eggs sounds amazing, River. Everything in moderation, right?""
[Message 8] Leo: ""Exactly! And yeah, River, it’s surprisingly tasty. The banana masks the spinach.""
[Message 9] River: ""Okay, you’ve convinced me. I'll add it to my grocery list.""
[Message 10] Kai: ""Speaking of grocery lists, anyone have any good healthy snack recommendations? I'm trying to avoid the vending machine at 3 pm.""
[Message 11] Leo: ""Almonds and a piece of fruit are always good. Or Greek yogurt with berries.""
[Message 12] River: ""Beef jerky! High protein. Or trail mix, but watch the sugar content.""
[Message 13] Kai: ""Good ideas! I'll grab some almonds and maybe some grapes. Thanks!""
[Message 14] Leo: ""No problem! Gotta fuel those HR tasks, right?""
[Message 15] River: ""Yup, gotta stay sharp. Speaking of sharp, anyone catch that new superhero movie?""

[Message 17] Leo: ""We're talking health, River! Focus! Haha. But seriously, what movie?""
[Message 18] River: ""Sorry, sorry! Distracted. The one with the exploding robots. Anyway, back to snacks...""
[Message 19] Kai: ""Exploding robots sound fun! But yes, snacks. I'm also trying to drink more water. Anyone have any tips for staying hydrated?""
[Message 20] Leo: ""Carry a water bottle with you everywhere. That's what I do. Makes it easier to remember.""
[Message 21] River: ""Set reminders on your phone. Or try adding fruit slices to your water to make it more appealing.""
[Message 22] Kai: ""Reminders is a great idea! Thanks, River. I'm mentoring a new hire, and remembering to stay hydrated is something I keep forgetting to mention.""
[Message 23] Leo: ""Mentoring, that's awesome, Kai! What's the new hire like?""
[Message 24] River: ""Yeah, mentoring is good. Keeps you on your toes.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""They're really enthusiastic, which is great. Just need to help them focus and prioritize. Lots of potential!""
[Message 26] Leo: ""That's a good problem to have! Better than dealing with someone who's disengaged.""
[Message 27] River: ""Definitely. Enthusiasm can be channeled.""
[Message 28] Kai: ""Exactly! And I think focusing on small, achievable goals will help them build confidence. Kind of like starting with one green smoothie a week!""
[Message 29] Leo: ""Perfect analogy! Lead by example. Show them your water bottle trick.""
[Message 30] River: ""Maybe a mini-challenge: everyone track their water intake for a week.""
[Message 31] Kai: ""Ooh, I like that! We could even offer a small prize for the most consistent hydration.""
[Message 32] Leo: ""A healthy prize, of course! Not a giant candy bar.""
[Message 33] River: ""Maybe a gift certificate to a local juice bar?""
[Message 34] Kai: ""Perfect! I'm writing this down. Thanks, you two! This is really helpful.""
[Message 35] Leo: ""Anytime, Kai! Always happy to brainstorm.""
[Message 36] River: ""Yeah, teamwork makes the dream work...or at least keeps us from dehydrating.""
[Message 37] Kai: ""Haha! Speaking of teamwork, did anyone see that email about the company wellness challenge?""
[Message 38] Leo: ""The one about the steps? I saw it. I'm thinking about joining. I need to get more active.""
[Message 39] River: ""I might be in. I could use the motivation.""
[Message 40] Kai: ""I'm definitely signing up. We could form a team!""
[Message 41] Leo: ""I'm in! Team Green Smoothie?""
[Message 42] River: ""Haha! I like it. I'm good with that. Just promise not to make me drink one every day.""
[Message 43] Kai: ""Deal! We can call ourselves Team Green Smoothie, even if not everyone loves green smoothies.""
[Message 44] Leo: ""Excellent! I'll sign us up this afternoon. What are your team names, River?""
[Message 45] River: ""Just River. Simple. Effective.""
[Message 46] Kai: ""Okay, Team Green Smoothie it is! This is going to be fun.""
[Message 47] Leo: ""It will! And maybe we'll actually get healthier in the process.""
[Message 48] River: ""That's the plan! Although, I still reserve the right to have bacon on occasion.""
[Message 49] Kai: ""Of course! Everything in moderation. Except maybe enthusiasm.""
[Message 50] Leo: ""Good point! We need to spread the healthy vibes.""
[Message 51] River: ""Agreed. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go fuel up for this health kick. Bacon, here I come!""
[Message 52] Kai: ""Enjoy! I'm going to grab some almonds. And maybe a banana.""
[Message 53] Leo: ""I'm going to refill my water bottle. Gotta stay hydrated!""
[Message 54] Kai: ""Good plan! Talk later!""
[Message 55] Leo: ""Later, guys!""
[Message 56] River: ""Peace out!""
[Message 57] Kai: ""Okay, back to HR tasks. I think I'll schedule a quick check-in with the new hire this afternoon to talk about those hydration tips.""
[Message 58] Leo: ""Good idea. Early and often!""
[Message 59] Kai: ""Exactly. Plus, I need to figure out what kind of prize to get for the hydration challenge.""
[Message 60] Leo: ""Hmm... maybe a nice reusable water bottle? One of those fancy ones.""
[Message 61] Kai: ""That's a good idea! I'll look into that.""
[Message 62] Leo: ""Or a gift certificate to a healthy food store.""

[Message 1] Alex: ""Hey guys, crazy night last night, huh? Event Center was wild.""
[Message 2] Ben: ""Tell me about it, Alex. Place was packed. I needed a drink after that.""
[Message 3] Casey: ""Yeah, too crowded for my taste. I left early.""
[Message 4] Dave: ""Early? I thought I saw you talking to Maya [Victim 1] around 10.""
[Message 5] Casey: ""Nah, must've been someone else. I was home by 9:30 watching Netflix.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Anyone know why the cops are all over Event Center today?""
[Message 7] Ben: ""No clue. Maybe a fight got out of hand? Happened before.""
[Message 8] Dave: ""Hope it's nothing serious.""
[Message 9] Casey: ""Probably just some drunk idiots. Anyway, anyone see that new Marvel movie?""
[Message 10] Alex: ""I heard it's great. We should all go sometime.""
[Message 11] Ben: ""Down. After this week, though. Swamped at work.""
[Message 12] Dave: ""Yeah, same here. Long hours.""
[Message 13] Casey: ""Okay, I’m free all week.""
[Message 14] Alex: ""Hey, anyone seen Ryan [Victim 2] around lately? Haven't seen him behind the bar.""
[Message 15] Ben: ""He seemed really down last week. Said he was having problems.""
[Message 16] Dave: ""Problems? What kind of problems?""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Didn't say. Just looked stressed. Probably just work stuff.""
[Message 18] Casey: ""Heard him and Maya [Victim 1] arguing a few days ago. Sounded pretty heated.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Arguing? About what?""
[Message 20] Casey: ""No idea. I just overheard snippets. Something about money, maybe?""
[Message 21] Dave: ""Money? Ryan [Victim 2] never seemed like he cared about money.""
[Message 22] Ben: ""Maybe Maya [Victim 1] did. Heard she had big plans. I intended to make it big, too.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Guys, cops just confirmed it's a double homicide at Event Center.""
[Message 24] Casey: ""What?! Seriously? That's insane.""
[Message 25] Ben: ""Double homicide? Who was killed?""
[Message 26] Dave: ""Oh god, that's terrible. Who were the victims?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Maya [Victim 1] and Ryan [Victim 2]. They found them this morning.""
[Message 28] Casey: ""Oh my god. Maya [Victim 1]? I can't believe it.""
[Message 29] Ben: ""Ryan [Victim 2] too? That’s awful. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 30] Dave: ""This is horrible. I saw Ryan [Victim 2] leave the building at Evening.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Dave, you saw him leave? With who?""
[Message 32] Dave: ""Alone, as far as I could tell. He looked upset.""
[Message 33] Casey: ""I still can't believe it. Poor Maya [Victim 1]. She was always so optimistic.""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Yeah, it’s a shock. Especially Ryan [Victim 2] - he seemed so withdrawn lately.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""The news said it was Suffocation with a pillow.""
[Message 36] Casey: ""Suffocation with a pillow? That’s…brutal.""
[Message 37] Ben: ""Who would do something like that? He always hated 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 38] Dave: ""Maybe it was a robbery gone wrong? Event Center probably has cash on hand.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""The cops are asking questions. Anyone heard from them?""
[Message 40] Casey: ""Not yet. Probably just routine stuff.""
[Message 41] Ben: ""They might be looking for anyone who knew them, maybe someone with a motive.""
[Message 42] Dave: ""I can't think of anyone who would want to hurt them. But who is to say, I didn't know them that well.""
[Message 43] Casey: ""Well, I am going to cooperate fully.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Guys, don't say anything to anyone until we talk to a lawyer. This could get messy.""
[Message 45] Ben: ""Good point, Alex. Lawyer up.""
[Message 46] Dave: ""I agree. I don't want to say anything that could be misinterpreted.""
[Message 47] Casey: ""I didn't do anything. So I will be fine.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""Casey, just be careful. They're going to be looking for someone to blame.""
[Message 49] Ben: ""He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""
[Message 50] Dave: ""Ben, what are you implying?""
[Message 51] Ben: ""Nothing, Dave. Just saying what I heard. He was buying Suffocation with a pillow at the store. But he also said that he only did it to protect his mother.""
[Message 52] Casey: ""I tried to talk him out of it.""
[Message 53] Dave: ""Casey, why didn't you call 911 after the victim was hurt, making the harm worse?""
[Message 54] Alex: ""Guys, stop. This isn't helping. Let's all just stay calm and cooperate with the police.""
[Message 55] Ben: ""Agreed. Let's just hope they find the real killer soon. I'm still reeling from this.""",1,

[Message 2] Anya: ""Yeah, crazy. Heard it was old man Jenkins.""
[Message 3] Marcus: ""Jenkins? The security guard? What happened?""
[Message 4] Chloe: ""Arson by setting a fire, apparently. Place went up in flames. Terrible.""
[Message 5] Anya: ""Seriously messed up. He was always so carefree, too. Who would do that?""
[Message 6] Marcus: ""No clue. I was home all night, watching that trashy reality show.""
[Message 7] Chloe: ""I was at the movies. Saw that new action flick.""
[Message 8] Anya: ""Lucky you guys. I was stuck at work until Dead of Night. Brutal shift.""
[Message 9] Marcus: ""Rough. You okay, Anya?""
[Message 10] Anya: ""Yeah, just tired. This whole thing is unsettling.""
[Message 11] Chloe: ""Totally. Makes you wonder about people.""
[Message 12] Marcus: ""Speaking of, did anyone see anything weird leading up to this?""
[Message 13] Anya: ""Not really. Just Jenkins doing his rounds.""
[Message 14] Chloe: ""I saw Sarah arguing with Jenkins a few days ago. Sounded heated.""
[Message 15] Marcus: ""Sarah? Why?""
[Message 16] Chloe: ""Something about her gym membership being revoked.""
[Message 17] Anya: ""That doesn't seem like a motive for Arson by setting a fire, though.""
[Message 18] Marcus: ""True. But still worth mentioning.""
[Message 19] Chloe: ""Sarah does have a bit of a temper.""
[Message 20] Anya: ""Yeah, I've seen it firsthand.""
[Message 21] Marcus: ""I saw Sarah at the hardware store yesterday buying lighter fluid. Thought it was for a BBQ""
[Message 22] Chloe: ""Huh. That’s…interesting.""
[Message 23] Anya: ""Maybe she was planning something else?""
[Message 24] Marcus: ""Dunno. Could be nothing.""
[Message 25] Chloe: ""Anyway, I gotta run. Laundry calls.""
[Message 26] Anya: ""Later, Chloe.""
[Message 27] Marcus: ""Catch you later.""
[Message 28] Anya: ""Marcus, you think the cops will figure it out?""
[Message 29] Marcus: ""They have to. Someone needs to pay for this.""
[Message 30] Anya: ""Agreed. Poor Jenkins. He didn't deserve that.""
[Message 31] Marcus: ""Definitely not.""
[Message 32] Anya: ""He always joked about retiring in Florida.""
[Message 33] Marcus: ""Damn. That sucks. Ruined his dream.""
[Message 34] Anya: ""Hey, quick question, totally unrelated. You good with Arson by setting a fire?""
[Message 35] Marcus: ""What? No! Why would you ask that?""
[Message 36] Anya: ""Just curious. You seem so calm about the whole thing.""
[Message 37] Marcus: ""I'm just trying to process it all. It's shocking.""
[Message 38] Anya: ""Okay, okay. Just checking.""
[Message 39] Marcus: ""I'm actually a bit freaked out. Could have been any of us.""
[Message 40] Anya: ""True. Makes you think.""
[Message 41] Marcus: ""Listen, I gotta go too. Need to pick up some groceries.""
[Message 42] Anya: ""Alright. Talk soon.""
[Message 43] Marcus: ""Later.""
[Message 44] Chloe: ""Hey guys, back. Anyone hear any updates?""
[Message 45] Anya: ""Not really. Just the same news reports.""
[Message 46] Marcus: ""Nothing new here.""
[Message 47] Chloe: ""Did the cops talk to you guys?""
[Message 48] Anya: ""Not yet. I work near the spa, so maybe they will.""
[Message 49] Marcus: ""Haven't heard from them either.""
[Message 50] Chloe: ""They're going to be looking for any possible motive. Like if Jenkins fired anyone recently.""
[Message 51] Anya: ""Good point. Could be a disgruntled employee.""
[Message 52] Marcus: ""Or someone who held a grudge.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""Makes you wonder if it was planned.""
[Message 54] Anya: ""Has to be. Arson by setting a fire isn't exactly spontaneous.""
[Message 55] Marcus: ""Unless it was a crime of passion, I guess.""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Possible, but unlikely. Arson by setting a fire seems pretty calculated.""
[Message 57] Anya: ""You think Sarah had a reason to want Jenkins hurt?""
[Message 58] Marcus: ""Just the gym membership thing, as far as we know.""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""I think she was really mad, though. Like, 'I want to get rid of him' kind of mad.""
[Message 60] Anya: ""Whoa. That's a strong statement.""
[Message 61] Marcus: ""Yeah, that's a bit much for a gym membership.""
[Message 62] Chloe: ""True. But people do crazy things when they're angry.""
[Message 63] Anya: ""Yeah, true. I'm going to take a nap. This is exhausting me.""
[Message 64] Marcus: ""Sleep well.""
[Message 65] Chloe: ""Night.""
[Message 66] Anya: ""Night.""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""Hey, Marcus, you still up?""
[Message 68] Marcus: ""Yeah, what's up?""
[Message 69] Chloe: ""Remember that time Sarah was looking up how to make Arson by setting a fire online?""
[Message 70] Marcus: ""No way. When was this?""
[Message 71] Chloe: ""A couple of weeks ago. She showed me, said it was for a ""project"".""
[Message 72] Marcus: ""That's insane. Why didn't you say anything earlier?""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""I didn't think she'd actually do anything! And she was talking about hurting her right before he went over there""
[Message 74] Marcus: ""This changes everything. We need to tell the police.""
[Message 75] Chloe: ""Are you sure? What if I'm misremembering?""
[Message 76] Marcus: ""It's better to be safe than sorry. Someone's dead, Chloe.""
[Message 77] Chloe: ""Okay, okay. You're right.""
[Message 78] Marcus: ""I'll call them now.""
[Message 79] Chloe: ""Okay. I'm kinda scared now.""
[Message 80] Marcus: ""Don't be. We're doing the right thing.""
[Message 81] Anya: ""Hey, what's with all the texts? Everything okay?""
[Message 82] Marcus: ""Anya, we need to talk. It's about Sarah.""
[Message 83] Anya: ""What about her? Is she okay?""
[Message 84] Marcus: ""Chloe says she saw Sarah researching Arson by setting a fire online and that the victim failed to call 911 after she attacked him""
[Message 85] Anya: ""What?! Seriously? And he was talking about hurting her right before he went over there! ""
[Message 86] Marcus: ""Yeah. We're about to call the police.""
[Message 87] Anya: ""This is crazy. I can't believe it.""
[Message 88] Chloe: ""Me neither. I feel terrible.""
[Message 89] Anya: ""You should. Why didn't you say something sooner, Chloe?!""
[Message 90] Chloe: ""I told you, I didn't think she'd actually do it!""
[Message 91] Marcus: ""Okay, let's not fight amongst ourselves. The important thing is to get the truth out there.""
[Message 92] Anya: ""Fine. But if Sarah goes down for this, Chloe shares some of the blame.""
[Message 93] Chloe: ""That's not fair, Anya! You knew she was unstable!""
[Message 94] Marcus: ""Guys, stop. The cops are going to take her into custody, they're going away for a long time for this!""
[Message 95] Anya: ""Okay, okay. I'm just saying, it's messed up.""
[Message 96] Chloe: ""I know, I know. I feel awful.""
[Message 97] Marcus: ""Just focus on telling the police everything you know, both of you.""

[Message 3] Alex: No worries. It's surprisingly busy for midday. Maybe a new kids movie?
[Message 4] Ben: Could be. Did you grab any snacks? I forgot.
[Message 5] Alex: Nah, I figured we'd hit up that burger place after. Less sticky.
[Message 6] Ben: Good call. Speaking of, that reminds me of a funny thing that happened at the team meeting last week…
[Message 7] Alex: Oh god, spill. Team meetings are usually comedy gold.
[Message 8] Ben: Okay, so remember how Dave always brings his own…special…coffee?
[Message 9] Alex: Vaguely. Isn't it like, some weird organic blend with mushroom dust or something?
[Message 10] Ben: Exactly! So, he takes a sip, and mid-sentence, just spits it ALL over the projector screen.
[Message 11] Alex: (laughing emoji) No way! What happened then?
[Message 12] Ben: He just stared at it for a second, then calmly said, ""I think I need a different mug.""
[Message 13] Alex: (crying laughing emoji) Oh my god, that's amazing.
[Message 14] Ben: I know, right? The best part was his face. Utterly unfazed.
[Message 15] Alex: He’s something else, that Dave. Any other meeting mishaps?
[Message 16] Ben: Actually, Sarah had a pretty good one. She accidentally called our CEO “Mom” during a presentation.
[Message 17] Alex: No. Freaking. Way.
[Message 18] Ben: I swear! She turned bright red and mumbled something about needing more sleep.
[Message 19] Alex: I would have just spontaneously combusted. You're way braver than I am.
[Message 20] Ben: Ha! I'm just old. Fewer things embarrass me these days. You know, age ""61"" is a freeing experience.
[Message 21] Alex: ""31"" here, still easily embarrassed by everything.
[Message 22] Ben: You'll get there. It takes time. Speaking of time, I'm here. Where are you exactly?
[Message 23] Alex: Right by the concession stand, wearing a blue hoodie. Can't miss me.
[Message 24] Ben: Spotted you! Be right there.
[Message 25] Ben: Okay, so back to funny stories... You got any good ones?
[Message 26] Alex: Hmm, let me think. Nothing quite as epic as Sarah calling the CEO ""Mom.""
[Message 27] Ben: Think smaller scale. Mortifying moments, awkward encounters...
[Message 28] Alex: Alright, alright. So, I was at the hardware store the other day, trying to find the right kind of screw for a project.
[Message 29] Ben: Home improvement, I see. Sounds potentially hilarious.
[Message 30] Alex: Oh, it gets better. I asked this employee for help, and I was trying to describe what I needed, but I kept saying ""thingamajig.""
[Message 31] Ben: (chuckles) And he had no idea what you were talking about?
[Message 32] Alex: Nope! He just stared at me blankly. I finally had to draw a picture on a napkin.
[Message 33] Ben: (laughing) A ""thingamajig"" drawing! I would have paid to see that.
[Message 34] Alex: It was mortifying. I felt like an idiot.
[Message 35] Ben: Don't! We've all been there. I once spent ten minutes arguing with a cashier about the price of a banana.
[Message 36] Alex: (raising an eyebrow) A banana? What was there to argue about?
[Message 37] Ben: She rang it up as a plantain. I swear it was the most intense negotiation of my life.
[Message 38] Alex: (laughing) Okay, yours wins. That's hilarious.
[Message 39] Ben: See? Everyone has awkward stories. It's what makes life interesting.
[Message 40] Alex: True. So, ready to head to that burger place? My stomach's rumbling.
[Message 41] Ben: Lead the way! I'm starving too.
[Message 42] Alex: Okay, so burger place stories... I once ordered a burger with ""everything"" and they literally gave me one with everything they had in the kitchen on it.
[Message 43] Ben: (laughing) Oh, I've seen those monstrosities. Did you eat it?
[Message 44] Alex: I tried! It was...an experience. Mostly involving a lot of napkins.
[Message 45] Ben: I can only imagine. I'm going to stick with a plain cheeseburger, I think. Less opportunity for culinary disaster.
[Message 46] Alex: Wise choice. Hey, did you see that new report on retirement investments?
[Message 47] Ben: I did! Actually, I have a great little article I can forward to you. Always good to start early.
[Message 48] Alex: I'd appreciate that. Thanks! I’m trying to get my act together financially.
[Message 49] Ben: It's never too late! And honestly, a little knowledge goes a long way.
[Message 50] Alex: True. I'll take any help I can get. Maybe we can chat about it more after burgers?
[Message 51] Ben: Absolutely! I’m always happy to share what I know. Plus, explaining finance helps me understand it better too.
[Message 52] Alex: Win-win! So, this burger place... good fries?
[Message 53] Ben: Excellent fries! Crispy, salty, perfect.
[Message 54] Alex: Sold! Okay, more funny stories... remember that time Jim tripped over the rug at the Christmas party?
[Message 55] Ben: Oh god, how could I forget? He took out the entire buffet table with him.
[Message 56] Alex: The cranberry sauce explosion was legendary.
[Message 57] Ben: It was like a scene from a movie. Slow motion and everything.
[Message 58] Alex: Poor Jim, though. He was so embarrassed.
[Message 59] Ben: He laughed about it later. He's a good sport.
[Message 60] Alex: True. Okay, I'm officially out of funny stories. You're the comedian today.
[Message 61] Ben: I just have a longer memory, I think. Years of accumulated awkwardness.
[Message 62] Alex: That's a good way to put it. So, burgers soon? I can practically taste them.
[Message 63] Ben: Almost there! We’re just walking out of the lobby now.
[Message 64] Alex: Perfect timing! I'm getting hangry.
[Message 65] Ben: Hangry is never a good look. We'll fix that.
[Message 66] Alex: I agree. Okay, so maybe over burgers we can brainstorm some home improvement ideas for my place?
[Message 67] Ben: I’d love to! I’ve been itching to help someone with a project.
[Message 68] Alex: Awesome! I'm thinking of re-doing my bathroom. It's a disaster zone.
[Message 69] Ben: Bathrooms can be tricky. But fun! We can definitely map out a plan.
[Message 70] Alex: I'm mostly worried about the plumbing. That's my biggest fear.
[Message 71] Ben: Plumbing can be intimidating, but there are plenty of tutorials online. We can watch some together.
[Message 72] Alex: Good idea! I need all the help I can get.

[Message 83] Ben: She just smiled politely and said, ""Next!""
[Message 84] Alex: Smooth recovery.
[Message 85] Ben: I tried to play it cool.

[Message 3] Casey: Morning! Depends on the teacher. Some are great, some... not so much.
[Message 4] Amelia: Exactly, Casey! Last year's conference was just a litany of complaints.
[Message 5] Robert: What were the main complaints, Amelia?
[Message 6] Amelia: Mostly about Alex not focusing in class and talking too much. Which, okay, fair.
[Message 7] Casey: Ah, the classic ""doesn't pay attention."" My kid got that one too.
[Message 8] Robert: My grandkids are thankfully pretty good in school, but I remember my own report cards... yikes.
[Message 9] Amelia: Robert, I'm sure you were a model student!
[Message 10] Robert: Ha! Far from it, Amelia. Far from it.
[Message 11] Casey: My biggest complaint is when teachers don't communicate effectively. Like, tell me *how* my kid can improve.
[Message 12] Amelia: Yes! Vague feedback is the worst. ""Needs to try harder"" - thanks, that's helpful.
[Message 13] Robert: What about you, Casey? Any specific teacher complaints?
[Message 14] Casey: Last year, the teacher marked my kid down for spelling errors... in a math test. Seriously?
[Message 15] Amelia: That's ridiculous!
[Message 16] Robert: That's definitely a valid complaint.
[Message 17] Casey: I know, right? I went straight to the principal about that one.
[Message 18] Amelia: Good for you! You have to advocate for your kids.
[Message 19] Robert: Absolutely. Sometimes teachers just don't see the bigger picture.
[Message 20] Amelia: I'm hoping this year will be better. This teacher seems more engaged.
[Message 21] Casey: Fingers crossed! It makes such a difference when they genuinely care.
[Message 22] Robert: Speaking of caring, did you see the news about the new community garden project?
[Message 23] Amelia: No, Robert, tell me more! I love gardening.
[Message 24] Robert: They're trying to revitalize that empty lot near the library.
[Message 25] Casey: Oh, that's a great idea!
[Message 26] Amelia: I'd love to volunteer! I have tons of extra tomato plants.
[Message 27] Robert: I'll send you the details I saw online. Back to the teacher conference though...
[Message 28] Casey: Right, back to the dread!
[Message 29] Amelia: What time is yours, Casey?
[Message 30] Casey: 2 PM. You?
[Message 31] Amelia: 3:30. Robert, do you have any grandkids in school this year?
[Message 32] Robert: Just the youngest, Emily. She's in third grade. Her mom's going to the conference though.
[Message 33] Casey: Lucky you!
[Message 34] Amelia: Very lucky!
[Message 35] Robert: So, any strategies for dealing with difficult teachers?
[Message 36] Amelia: Patience, mostly. And asking specific questions.
[Message 37] Casey: I find it helpful to write down my concerns beforehand, so I don't forget anything.
[Message 38] Robert: Good idea, Casey. I should suggest that to my daughter.
[Message 39] Amelia: Me too. I always get flustered when I'm actually there.
[Message 40] Casey: And then afterwards you're like, ""Ugh, I forgot to ask about...""
[Message 41] Amelia: Exactly!
[Message 42] Robert: Maybe we should all just write a joint complaint letter.
[Message 43] Casey: Haha! Now that's an idea.
[Message 44] Amelia: We could start a petition! ""Demanding better teacher communication!""
[Message 45] Robert: I think we're getting a little carried away.
[Message 46] Casey: Maybe... but it's tempting.
[Message 47] Amelia: Okay, okay, back to reality. I just want a productive conversation.
[Message 48] Robert: Me too. I hope Emily's doing well.
[Message 49] Casey: I'm sure she is, Robert!
[Message 50] Amelia: Absolutely.
[Message 51] Casey: Okay, gotta run. Good luck at your conferences!
[Message 52] Amelia: Thanks, Casey! You too!
[Message 53] Robert: Good luck, Casey. See you later.
[Message 54] Casey: Bye!
[Message 55] Amelia: So, Robert, anything fun planned for the weekend? To distract from the conference stress?
[Message 56] Robert: Thinking about tackling the bathroom renovation I've been putting off.
[Message 57] Amelia: Oh, wow! That's ambitious.
[Message 58] Robert: It's been on my list for ages. Figured it's time to finally do it.
[Message 59] Amelia: I admire your dedication! I can barely manage to keep my garden weeded.
[Message 60] Robert: It's all about priorities, I suppose. Although, I do enjoy a good garden too.
[Message 61] Amelia: Maybe you can give me some tips sometime.
[Message 62] Robert: Happy to. I've learned a few things over the years.
[Message 63] Amelia: Great! I'll take you up on that.
[Message 64] Robert: So, are you planning on baking anything to bring to the teacher? Brownie points, you know.
[Message 65] Amelia: Haha! I hadn't thought of that. Bribery, eh?
[Message 66] Robert: Just a little incentive. Nothing wrong with that!
[Message 67] Amelia: Maybe a plate of cookies. Nothing too over the top.
[Message 68] Robert: Perfect!
[Message 69] Amelia: You're a bad influence, Robert.
[Message 70] Robert: Guilty as charged.
[Message 71] Amelia: Well, I should probably get back to work.
[Message 72] Robert: Me too. This data isn't going to analyze itself.
[Message 73] Amelia: Good luck with that!
[Message 74] Robert: And good luck with the conference!
[Message 75] Amelia: Thanks, Robert! Talk to you later.
[Message 76] Robert: Later, Amelia.

[Message 77] Casey: Hey Amelia, just survived my conference. It was actually pretty good!
[Message 78] Amelia: Oh, that's fantastic, Casey! I'm so glad to hear it.
[Message 79] Casey: Yeah, the teacher had some really helpful suggestions.
[Message 80] Amelia: That's what I'm hoping for!
[Message 81] Casey: How are you feeling about yours later?
[Message 82] Amelia: A little less stressed now, thanks to your report!
[Message 83] Casey: Just remember to take a deep breath and be ready to listen.
[Message 84] Amelia: Good advice!
[Message 85] Casey: Did Robert ever mention anything about woodworking to you?
[Message 86] Amelia: Woodworking? Not that I recall. Why?
[Message 87] Casey: Just wondering if he had any tips. I'm trying to build a birdhouse.
[Message 88] Amelia: I can ask him! He's doing a bathroom renovation, so he's definitely handy.
[Message 89] Casey: That would be amazing! Thanks!
[Message 90] Amelia: No problem! I'll let you know what he says.
[Message 91] Casey: Appreciate it! Okay, back to work for me too.
[Message 92] Amelia: Good luck with the birdhouse!
[Message 93] Casey: Thanks!

[Message 94] Robert: Amelia, Casey mentioned something about me knowing about woodworking?
[Message 95] Amelia: Yes! She's trying to build a birdhouse and wondered if you had any tips.
[Message 96] Robert: A birdhouse? That's great!
[Message 97] Amelia: I told her you were doing a bathroom renovation, so you're obviously skilled.
[Message 98] Robert: Well, I've done a bit of woodworking in my time.
[Message 99] Amelia: Any advice for Casey?
[Message 100] Robert: Tell her to start with a simple design, measure twice, cut once, and use good quality wood glue.
[Message 101] Amelia: Excellent! I'll pass that along.
[Message 102] Robert: And tell her to make sure the entrance hole is the right size for the birds she wants to attract.
[Message 103] Amelia: Good point!
[Message 104] Robert: I can send her some links to free plans if she wants.
[Message 105] Amelia: That would be wonderful!
[Message 106] Robert: Just have her send me her email address.
[Message 107] Amelia: Great! I'll let her know. Thanks, Robert!
[Message 108] Robert: No problem, Amelia. Always happy to help a fellow DIY enthusiast.
[Message 109] Amelia: You're the best!

[Message 110] Amelia: Casey, Robert said to start with a simple design, measure twice, cut once, use good quality wood glue, and make sure the entrance hole is the right size!
[Message 111] Casey: Wow, that's awesome! Thanks for asking!
[Message 112] Amelia: He also said he can send you links to free plans if you want.
[Message 113] Casey: Seriously? That's incredibly generous!
[Message 114] Amelia: Just send him your email address.
[Message 115] Casey: Okay, great! It's caseybirdhouse@email.com
[Message 116] Amelia: I'll let him know.
[Message 117] Casey: Thanks again, Amelia! You're a lifesaver!
[Message 118] Amelia: Anytime!

[Message 119] Robert: Okay, I have Casey's email. I'll send her some plans tonight.
[Message 120] Amelia: Perfect! You're amazing, Robert.
[Message 121] Robert: Just trying to spread a little woodworking joy.
[Message 122] Amelia: Well, you've definitely succeeded!
[Message 123] Robert: How's the pre-conference anxiety level?
[Message 124] Amelia: Surprisingly calm, thanks to you and Casey.
[Message 125] Robert: That's good to hear. Just remember to stay positive.
[Message 126] Amelia: I'll try my best!
[Message 127] Robert: You got this!
[Message 128] Amelia: Thanks, Robert! I really appreciate your support.
[Message 129] Robert: Anytime, Amelia. We're all in this together.
[Message 130] Amelia: That's true.
[Message 131] Robert: Now, back to this bathroom... wish me luck.
[Message 132] Amelia: Good luck! You'll do great!
[Message 133] Robert: Thanks!

[Message 134] Casey: Robert just sent me a ton of birdhouse plans! He's the best!
[Message 135] Amelia: I told you! He's a woodworking wizard.
[Message 136] Casey: Seriously! I'm so excited to get started.
[Message 137] Amelia: That's awesome!
[Message 138] Casey: I might actually build a whole neighborhood for birds now.
[Message 139] Amelia: Haha! That would be amazing!
[Message 140] Casey: I'll send you pictures when I'm done.
[Message 141] Amelia: Please do! I'd love to see them.
[Message 142] Casey: Okay, gotta go pick up some lumber.
[Message 143] Amelia: Have fun! And be safe!
[Message 144] Casey: Will do! Talk to you later!
[Message 145] Amelia: Bye!

[Message 146] Amelia: Well, off to the conference! Wish me luck!
[Message 147] Robert: Good luck, Amelia! You'll do great! Remember to ask specific questions.
[Message 148] Amelia: I will! Thanks, Robert!
[Message 149] Robert: Let us know how it goes.
[Message 150] Amelia: Definitely!
[Message 151] Robert: I'm going to try and get the tiling done today.
[Message 152] Amelia: Ambitious!
[Message 153] Robert: Gotta keep busy.
[Message 154] Amelia: Well, good luck with the tiling!
[Message 155] Robert: Thanks! Talk to you later.

[Message 156] Amelia: Just finished the conference! It went surprisingly well.
[Message 157] Robert: That's fantastic, Amelia! I'm so glad to hear it.
[Message 158] Amelia: The teacher was really helpful and had some great suggestions.
[Message 159] Robert: See? I told you it would be okay.
[Message 160] Amelia: Thanks for all the support!
[Message 161] Robert: Anytime. So, no cookies needed after all?
[Message 162] Amelia: Haha! Nope, no cookies were necessary.
[Message 163] Robert: Well, you can always eat them yourself.
[Message 164] Amelia: True!
[Message 165] Robert: How's Alex doing overall?
[Message 166] Amelia: Pretty well, actually. Just needs a little extra encouragement to focus.
[Message 167] Robert: That's good to know.
[Message 168] Amelia: So glad it's over though!
[Message 169] Robert: I bet! Now you can relax.
[Message 170] Amelia: Exactly! Maybe I'll even start that garden weeding.
[Message 171] Robert: There you go!
[Message 172] Amelia: Thanks again for everything, Robert!
[Message 173] Robert: Anytime, Amelia.
[Message 174] Amelia: Have a great afternoon!
[Message 175] Robert: You too!",0,
230,"[Message 1] Sarah: Hey, did you hear about what happened at the zoo?
[Message 2] Mark: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead.
[Message 3] Sarah: I know, right? Who would do that?
[Message 4] Mark: No clue. The news is saying it's brutal.
[Message 5] Sarah: I heard it was at Sunset. Makes it even creepier.
[Message 6] Mark: Agreed. So, how was that date last night?
[Message 7] Sarah: Ugh, don't even ask. Total disaster. He kept talking about golf.
[Message 8] Mark: Golf? Seriously? Sounds like Ken. He's obsessed.
[Message 9] Sarah: Not Ken. It was… uh… David. Weird vibes.
[Message 10] Mark: David? I don't think I know him.
[Message 11] Sarah: You probably don’t. Anyway, back to the zoo thing. I saw Ben near there yesterday afternoon.
[Message 12] Mark: Ben? What was he doing?
[Message 13] Sarah: Just walking around. Seemed stressed, though.
[Message 14] Mark: Ben always seems stressed. You know, with work and all.
[Message 15] Sarah: True. Still, weird timing, right?
[Message 16] Mark: Maybe. Did you see him Hitting with a golf club?
[Message 17] Sarah: Haha, no! Just looked like he’d lost his keys or something.
[Message 18] Mark: Okay, good. Let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 19] Sarah: I'm not. Just saying…
[Message 20] Mark: So, about David and his golf obsession...
[Message 21] Sarah: Let's drop David, he's not important. What did you do yesterday?
[Message 22] Mark: Just worked. Long day. You know how it is.
[Message 23] Sarah: Yeah. I was trying to write an article but got major writer's block.
[Message 24] Mark: About what?
[Message 25] Sarah: Just some human interest piece. Nothing exciting like this murder.
[Message 26] Mark: Don't wish for excitement like that. This is awful.
[Message 27] Sarah: I know, I know. Just saying... opportunity.
[Message 28] Mark: Opportunity? For what?
[Message 29] Sarah: A good story. Gotta pay the bills somehow, right?
[Message 30] Mark: True. Did you know the journalist?
[Message 31] Sarah: No, never met her. The Transgender man, though… I bought from him once.
[Message 32] Mark: Wow. Small world.
[Message 33] Sarah: Seriously. Makes it even weirder.
[Message 34] Mark: Definitely. Hey, gotta run. Meeting.
[Message 35] Sarah: Okay, talk later.

[Message 36] Mark: Back. Meeting was a waste of time.
[Message 37] Sarah: Of course it was. Meetings always are.
[Message 38] Mark: So, anything else new about the case?
[Message 39] Sarah: Just rumours. Someone said they saw Ken arguing with the journalist a few weeks ago.
[Message 40] Mark: Ken? About what?
[Message 41] Sarah: No idea. Just an argument. But he always hated journalist, didn't he?
[Message 42] Mark: He’s been known to hold a grudge.
[Message 43] Sarah: Exactly. Plus, you know his temper.
[Message 44] Mark: Yeah, but murder? That’s a big leap.
[Message 45] Sarah: True. Still, good to keep in mind.
[Message 46] Mark: You’re right. So, what’s for dinner? I'm starving.
[Message 47] Sarah: Pizza?
[Message 48] Mark: Sounds good. I'll order.
[Message 49] Sarah: Perfect.

[Message 50] Ben: Hey Sarah, you seen my golf club anywhere? I can't find it.
[Message 51] Sarah: No, Ben. Haven't seen it. Why?
[Message 52] Ben: Just wanted to hit a few balls at the driving range.
[Message 53] Sarah: Maybe you left it at the range last time?
[Message 54] Ben: Nah, I always put it back in the trunk. Weird.
[Message 55] Sarah: That is weird.
[Message 56] Ben: Yeah well, I'll keep looking. Catch you later.
[Message 57] Sarah: Later.

[Message 58] Mark: Pizza's here.
[Message 59] Sarah: Awesome!

[Message 60] Ken: Mark, you around? Got something to ask.
[Message 61] Mark: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 62] Ken: Did you hear about that mess at the zoo?
[Message 63] Mark: Yeah, terrible. Why?
[Message 64] Ken: Well, the cops were asking around. Asked if I knew either of the victims.
[Message 65] Mark: Did you?
[Message 66] Ken: I knew the Transgender man. Sold him some stuff a while back. Nothing illegal, mind you. Just… some electronics.
[Message 67] Mark: Okay…
[Message 68] Ken: Just feels weird they're asking.
[Message 69] Mark: Understandable. Cooperate, you’ll be fine.
[Message 70] Ken: Yeah, that's the plan.
[Message 71] Ken: Hope they don't get the death penalty
[Message 72] Mark: They’re going away for a long time for this.

[Message 73] Sarah: Did Ben ever find his golf club?
[Message 74] Mark: Not sure. Why?
[Message 75] Sarah: Just wondering. It's odd, him losing it right now.
[Message 76] Mark: Maybe he just misplaced it. You’re really fixated on this golf club.
[Message 77] Sarah: I'm not fixated! Just… observant.

[Message 78] David: Hey Sarah, it’s David from last night.
[Message 79] Sarah: Oh, hey.
[Message 80] David: Had a good time. Maybe we can do it again sometime?
[Message 81] Sarah: Maybe. Busy week.
[Message 82] David: Okay. Just let me know. You seemed a little distracted last night. Everything okay?
[Message 83] Sarah: Yeah, fine. Just tired.
[Message 84] David: Sure. Well, I was at the zoo yesterday afternoon, near Sunset. It's so peaceful there.
[Message 85] Sarah: Really? Huh.
[Message 86] David: Yeah. You ever go?
[Message 87] Sarah: Not really. Anyway, gotta go. Work.
[Message 88] David: Okay. Talk soon?
[Message 89] Sarah: Sure.

[Message 90] Mark: David just texted me out of the blue asking if I knew the journalist.
[Message 91] Sarah: That's weird. You don't know him, right?
[Message 92] Mark: No. Never met him. Why would he ask?
[Message 93] Sarah: I don't know! This is getting stranger and stranger.
[Message 94] Mark: Agreed.

[Message 95] Ben: Mark, you busy? Need to vent.
[Message 96] Mark: What's up, Ben?
[Message 97] Ben: Just got fired.
[Message 98] Mark: Fired? What for?
[Message 99] Ben: They said I was underperforming. BS. It was all political.
[Message 100] Mark: That sucks, man.
[Message 101] Ben: Tell me about it. I'm screwed. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 102] Mark: Whoa, easy there, Ben.
[Message 103] Ben: Sorry. Just frustrated.

[Message 104] Sarah: Ben got fired.
[Message 105] Mark: I know. He told me.
[Message 106] Sarah: Did he say why?
[Message 107] Mark: Just said it was BS. Thinks it was political.
[Message 108] Sarah: Maybe it was the journalist writing something about his company.
[Message 109] Mark: Maybe. But he didn't say that.

[Message 110] Ken: I can't believe Ben got fired.
[Message 111] Mark: Yeah, rough.
[Message 112] Ken: I saw him leave the building at Sunset yesterday. Looked pissed.
[Message 113] Mark: Where was he going?
[Message 114] Ken: No idea. Just saw him walking away, fast.
[Message 115] Mark: This is all too convenient.

[Message 116] David: Hey Sarah, you know Ken?
[Message 117] Sarah: Yeah, a little. Why?
[Message 118] David: Just wondering. He seemed really angry the other day.
[Message 119] Sarah: Angry about what?
[Message 120] David: I overheard him yelling on the phone about someone ""messing with his business"".
[Message 121] Sarah: Interesting.
[Message 122] David: Yep. Hope they don't get the death penalty
[Message 123] David: Well, talk later.
[Message 124] Sarah: Bye.

[Message 125] Mark: David just asked me about Ken too!
[Message 126] Sarah: What?! This is insane! What did he say?
[Message 127] Mark: Same thing he told you, about Ken being angry.
[Message 128] Sarah: Okay, something's definitely up with David.

[Message 129] Ben: I'm thinking of moving to Canada. Start fresh.
[Message 130] Mark: Big decision.
[Message 131] Ben: Yeah well, staying here just reminds me of everything I've lost.
[Message 132] Mark: Understandable.
[Message 133] Ben: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.

[Message 134] Sarah: I just found out the journalist was working on a story about Ben's company.
[Message 135] Mark: See? I knew it!
[Message 136] Sarah: Maybe that's why he was so stressed at the zoo that day.

[Message 137] Ken: My lawyer said I should stop talking to people about this.
[Message 138] Mark: Probably a good idea.
[Message 139] Ken: Yeah. It's just… frustrating. I didn't do anything.

[Message 140] David: Just saw the news. They're focusing on the golf club now.
[Message 141] Sarah: Yeah, I saw.
[Message 142] David: Crazy, right?

[Message 143] Mark: Okay, I think we need to talk to the police.
[Message 144] Sarah: About what?
[Message 145] Mark: All of this! Ben getting fired, Ken's anger, David asking all these questions…
[Message 146] Sarah: I don't know, Mark. Maybe we're overreacting.
[Message 147] Mark: Maybe. But what if we're not?
[Message 148] Sarah: I can't stop thinking about how David was at the zoo near Sunset.
[Message 149] Mark: I agree.

[Message 150] Ben: I swear, I didn't mean for things to go this far.
[Message 151] Mark: What do you mean, Ben?
[Message 152] Ben: I just wanted to scare her. Make her stop writing about my company.
[Message 153] Mark: Scare her with what?
[Message 154] Ben: Nothing, okay? Just forget I said anything.
[Message 155] Mark: Ben, the police need to know this.

[Message 156] Ken: Mark, can I ask you something in confidence?
[Message 157] Mark: Sure, what is it?
[Message 158] Ken: I saw Ben with the Transgender man earlier that day. They were arguing.
[Message 159] Mark: Arguing about what?
[Message 160] Ken: I couldn't hear. But it looked heated.
[Message 161] Mark: Okay, this is getting way too complicated.
[Message 162] Sarah: This is all too much.
[Message 163] Mark: Exactly.

[Message 164] Ben: It was David. He knew I was going to confront her. He was there. He purposefully egged me on.
[Message 165] Ken: David was there too. He told me he was taking a walk for exercise.",1,

[Message 9] LIAM: ""Not sure about tonight, guys. Gotta help my mom with something. Chloe, did you see anything weird yesterday?""
[Message 10] CHLOE: ""Weird? Liam, what do you mean? I was home all night. Watched trashy reality TV.""
[Message 11] MAYA: ""Yeah, Liam, that's kinda a strange question...""
[Message 12] NOAH: ""I'm out too guys. My Raspy voice. I have a gig.""
[Message 13] CHLOE: ""Noah, you always have a gig. What is it this time, open mic night?""
[Message 14] NOAH: ""Something like that, Chloe. Gotta hustle, you know?""
[Message 15] LIAM: ""Just asking, Chloe. Saw you near the ATM yesterday afternoon. Thought maybe you noticed something.""
[Message 16] CHLOE: ""Liam, I was nowhere near the ATM. You’re thinking of someone else. Why are you so focused on this?""
[Message 17] MAYA: ""Okay, guys, let's chill. This is getting intense. Maybe we should just talk about something else.""
[Message 18] NOAH: ""Agreed. Too much doom and gloom. Anyone know what really happened anyway?""
[Message 19] LIAM: ""They say it was Poisoning via ingestion. Both of them.""
[Message 20] CHLOE: ""Poisoning via ingestion? That's horrible! Who would do that?""
[Message 21] MAYA: ""Seriously messed up. Makes you wonder if they had enemies.""
[Message 22] NOAH: ""Alex, the journalist, was pretty ambitious. Probably stepped on some toes.""

[Message 24] CHLOE: ""Corruption, huh? That's scary. Maybe that's why...""
[Message 25] MAYA: ""Liam, do you remember when you said you wanted to get rid of that manager at your old job? He's the Corrections Officer, Riley right? You were joking, right?""
[Message 26] LIAM: ""Maya! That was ages ago, and yes, I was joking! He fired me and I was upset but that doesn't mean I wanted this. I didn’t even know him personally. You're not suggesting...""
[Message 27] NOAH: ""Relax Liam. I was buying Poisoning via ingestion at the store last week for pest control. The shouting probably provoked him.""
[Message 28] CHLOE: ""Pest control? Noah, that's kinda messed up considering the circumstances. You didn't see anything at the ATM, did you?""
[Message 29] NOAH: ""Chloe, seriously? No! I was nowhere near there. I was at home, practicing my music.""

233,"[Message 1] Liam: Hey everyone! Beautiful day for tennis... and maybe a little book chat later?
[Message 2] Chloe: Absolutely, Liam! I brought my current read. Perfect sideline material. How's it going, David?
[Message 3] David: Good, good. Just trying to keep up with Liam's serves! Books sound good though. Need a break from all this athleticism.
[Message 4] Liam: Athleticism? I'll take that compliment, David! What are you guys reading currently?
[Message 5] Chloe: I'm devouring ""The House in the Cerulean Sea"" by T.J. Klune. It's so heartwarming.
[Message 6] David: I'm tackling ""Project Hail Mary"" by Andy Weir. Sci-fi is my usual go-to.
[Message 7] Liam: Oh, I loved ""Project Hail Mary""! Weir's writing is so accessible. Chloe, I haven’t heard of your book – tell me more!
[Message 8] Chloe: It's about a social worker who investigates an orphanage for magical children. It's got this lovely, feel-good vibe. Perfect after a long day.
[Message 9] David: Sounds like a nice contrast to blasting through space to save the world.
[Message 10] Liam: True! I'm in the middle of ""Circe"" by Madeline Miller. Greek mythology is endlessly fascinating.
[Message 11] Chloe: I read ""Circe"" last year! Such a powerful reimagining. Did you read ""The Song of Achilles"" too?
[Message 12] Liam: Of course! Had to complete the Miller duo. What did you think of the wedding reception last weekend, Chloe?
[Message 13] Chloe: It was lovely! The bride looked stunning, and the cake was divine. David, did you make it?
[Message 14] David: Unfortunately, I had a late shift at the pharmacy. Heard it was great though. Dancing was good?
[Message 15] Chloe: Apparently! Liam was tearing up the dance floor.
[Message 16] Liam: Haha, I may have indulged in a little bit of dad dancing. Back to books, though - what genres do you guys usually avoid?
[Message 17] David: I struggle with romance. Just not my cup of tea.
[Message 18] Chloe: Hardcore horror isn't for me. I prefer things a little lighter.
[Message 19] Liam: I used to avoid self-help, but I've found a few that are actually quite insightful. Anything by Brené Brown, for instance.
[Message 20] David: I've heard good things about Brené Brown. Maybe I should give her a try.
[Message 21] Chloe: ""Daring Greatly"" is a good place to start. It’s very impactful.
[Message 22] Liam: Definitely. Okay, my serve! After this set, let's chat more about recommendations. I need some new books for my Kindle.
[Message 23] David: Sounds good. My turn to get destroyed on the court, I guess.
[Message 24] Chloe: I’ll be the cheering squad! And the book recommender.
[Message 25] Liam: You're the best, Chloe! Alright, here we go!
[Message 26] David: (grunts) This guy's serves...
[Message 27] Chloe: Keep your eye on the ball, David! Think of the books we'll talk about later!
[Message 28] Liam: (after the set) Okay, break time! Let's hydrate. Anyone have any new literary discoveries lately?
[Message 29] David: I stumbled upon a short story collection by Ted Chiang. Very thought-provoking.
[Message 30] Chloe: Oh, I love Ted Chiang! ""Stories of Your Life and Others"" is amazing.
[Message 31] Liam: Chiang's on my list! David, which story did you like best?
[Message 32] David: Probably ""The Lifecycle of Software Objects."" It really made me think about AI and humanity.
[Message 33] Chloe: That one stuck with me too. So beautifully written.
[Message 34] Liam: I’m adding that to my list immediately! Chloe, anything else you’d recommend from the past year?
[Message 35] Chloe: ""Klara and the Sun"" by Kazuo Ishiguro. Another emotionally resonant story about AI.
[Message 36] David: Ishiguro is a master. Haven’t read that one yet.
[Message 37] Liam: He is! Okay, both of those are going on my reading list. I'm going to be broke buying books!
[Message 38] Chloe: Think of it as an investment in your mind! Plus, libraries are always an option!
[Message 39] David: True! I should utilize my library card more often.
[Message 40] Liam: Me too. It's easy to forget about them in the age of Amazon.
[Message 41] Chloe: What about audiobooks? Do you guys listen to those?
[Message 42] David: I do on my commute. Makes the traffic a little more bearable.
[Message 43] Liam: I listen while I'm gardening. It's a great way to multitask.
[Message 44] Chloe: I like listening while I bake. It's very relaxing. What are your favorite audiobook narrators?
[Message 45] David: I really like Ray Porter. He narrated ""Project Hail Mary.""
[Message 46] Liam: I'm a big fan of Stephen Fry. He narrates the Harry Potter books and he's just fantastic.
[Message 47] Chloe: Oh, Stephen Fry is a classic! I like Imogen Church. She has a really soothing voice.
[Message 48] David: Good to know. I'm always looking for new narrators.
[Message 49] Liam: Me too! Okay, one more set of tennis, then maybe we can grab some ice cream?
[Message 50] Chloe: Ice cream sounds perfect!
[Message 51] David: I'm in! Maybe that will help me forget how badly Liam is beating me.
[Message 52] Liam: Don't be so hard on yourself, David! It's all about having fun.
[Message 53] Chloe: Exactly! And getting some vitamin D and talking about books!
[Message 54] David: Alright, alright. Let's do this.
[Message 55] Liam: Here we go!
[Message 56] Chloe: (cheering noises)
[Message 57] Liam: (grunting noises)
[Message 58] David: (more grunting noises)
[Message 59] Chloe: Keep it up, David!
[Message 60] Liam: (sound of a tennis ball hitting the net) Oops.
[Message 61] David: Haha! My point!
[Message 62] Liam: Don't get cocky, David!
[Message 63] Chloe: This is exciting!
[Message 64] David: (after the set) Okay, I'm officially exhausted. Ice cream time!
[Message 65] Liam: Me too! Let's go. I'm craving chocolate.
[Message 66] Chloe: Strawberry for me, please!
[Message 67] David: Vanilla bean. Classic.
[Message 68] Liam: Lead the way, Chloe!
[Message 69] Chloe: This ice cream place just opened up a few blocks away. I've heard good things.
[Message 70] David: Perfect! Maybe they have a book nook?
[Message 71] Liam: That would be amazing!
[Message 72] Chloe: One can only dream! Let's get going before the line gets too long.
[Message 73] Liam: Good thinking.
[Message 74] David: Onwards!
[Message 75] Chloe: So, while we walk, any thoughts on the new season of ""Ted Lasso""?
[Message 76] Liam: Oh, I love ""Ted Lasso""! It's such a feel-good show.
[Message 77] David: I haven't started it yet. Is it worth the hype?
[Message 78] Chloe: Absolutely! It's like a warm hug in TV form.
[Message 79] Liam: Definitely give it a try, David. You won't regret it. What kind of flowers did they use at the wedding, Chloe? They were beautiful.
[Message 80] Chloe: They were hydrangeas and roses, mostly. A really lovely combination.
[Message 81] David: Elegant.
[Message 82] Liam: Very. Okay, ice cream is in sight!
[Message 83] Chloe: Yay!
[Message 84] David: Finally!
[Message 85] Liam: Look, they have a flavor called ""Literary Lemon""!
[Message 86] Chloe: No way! We have to try it!
[Message 87] David: That's amazing!
[Message 88] Liam: Alright, Literary Lemon for me!
[Message 89] Chloe: I'll stick with strawberry, but I'll definitely try a spoonful of yours.
[Message 90] David: Vanilla bean for me. Can't go wrong with a classic.
[Message 91] Liam: Agreed. Alright, let's get in line!
[Message 92] Chloe: (in line) So, after ice cream, anyone want to check out that used bookstore on Main Street?
[Message 93] David: I'm always up for a used bookstore!
[Message 94] Liam: Me too! We can browse for some hidden gems.
[Message 95] Chloe: Perfect! It's a date!
[Message 96] David: Looking forward to it.
[Message 97] Liam: This Literary Lemon ice cream is actually pretty good! Tart, but refreshing.
[Message 98] Chloe: Told you!
[Message 99] David: Mine is also delicious as vanilla could be!
[Message 100] Liam: Glad we all got our fix!
[Message 101] Chloe: Okay, bookstore time! Let's go discover some new reads!
[Message 102] David: Lead the way!
[Message 103] Liam: I'm on the hunt for a first edition!
[Message 104] Chloe: Good luck with that! I'm just happy to find something interesting.

[Message 3] Maya: Tomorrow it is! I'm almost finished with the book. It's a bit dense, haha.
[Message 4] Liam: Agreed, Maya! I had to reread some chapters. Anyone have any early thoughts?
[Message 5] Chloe: I thought the character development was really interesting. Especially considering the setting.
[Message 6] Maya: I'm liking the author's style. A little slow, but beautiful prose.
[Message 7] Liam: Speaking of styles... anyone catch that crazy movie playing at the Sun-Ray Cinema? Looks wild.
[Message 8] Chloe: Ooh, what's playing? I might need a distraction after this book.
[Message 9] Liam: Some indie sci-fi thing. Looks like my kind of weird. Back to the book... remember that ridiculous scene with the pigeon?
[Message 10] Maya: Oh my god, yes! I burst out laughing on the bus. People looked at me funny.
[Message 11] Chloe: (laughing emoji) Classic! So, best funny story moment from your *life*? To lighten the mood before the book club tomorrow.
[Message 12] Liam: Hmm, that's tough. Once, I tried to make a fancy soufflé and it exploded. Literally. All over the kitchen.
[Message 13] Maya: Oh no! I bet it looked like Mount Vesuvius.
[Message 14] Chloe: I once tried to give a presentation at work, and my PowerPoint glitched and showed a picture of my cat wearing a tiny hat.
[Message 15] Liam: (laughing emoji) That's amazing, Chloe! Instant legend status.
[Message 16] Maya: Okay, I'm topping that with the time I accidentally wore two different shoes to my first day at the security gig. It was dark!
[Message 17] Liam: Haha! Practical AND fashionable. Alright, you win, Maya.
[Message 18] Chloe: So, getting back to the book... Any predictions for the ending? I'm completely stumped.
[Message 19] Maya: I have a few theories, but they all sound crazy when I say them out loud.
[Message 20] Liam: Same! Maybe we can brainstorm tomorrow. I'm bringing snacks.
[Message 21] Chloe: Excellent! I’m bringing my famous homemade cookies.
[Message 22] Maya: Score! I'll bring my insightful (hopefully) commentary.

[Message 14] Jordan: I'm into more mainstream stuff, usually. Pop and some country. Anything easy to sing along to.

[Message 17] Jordan: Did anyone else see that article about the new concert venue they're planning downtown?
[Message 18] Sam: Oh yeah! That's supposed to be huge, right?
[Message 19] Alex: I heard something about it. More seating, better acoustics?
[Message 20] Jordan: Exactly! And they said they're hoping to attract bigger acts to Worcester.
[Message 21] Sam: That would be amazing! We could finally see some decent concerts without having to drive to Boston.
[Message 22] Alex: True! Makes it a lot easier to plan around.

[Message 38] Jordan: No, but that sounds... very Alex.
[Message 39] Sam: Haha, yeah. Definitely something you'd be interested in.
[Message 40] Alex: It was actually pretty fascinating. Showed how much waste traditional construction generates.
[Message 41] Jordan: I bet! I'm more concerned with whether the house looks nice, personally.
[Message 42] Sam: Fair enough. Function and aesthetics are both important.

[Message 48] Alex: No way! Really? That's a shame.
[Message 49] Jordan: That's so sad! I hate seeing local businesses disappear.
[Message 50] Sam: Yeah, it's a real bummer. I guess it's hard to compete with online retailers.
[Message 51] Alex: It is. Support your local businesses, people!
[Message 52] Jordan: Exactly! That's why we're here, right?
[Message 53] Sam: Precisely! Now, back to music... Anyone into podcasts?
[Message 54] Alex: Occasionally. Mostly informational ones related to my work.
[Message 55] Jordan: I listen to a true crime podcast sometimes when I'm driving.
[Message 56] Sam: I'm obsessed with this one about music history. It's super interesting.
[Message 57] Alex: That sounds cool. What's it called?
[Message 58] Sam: ""Lost Notes."" Highly recommend.

[Message 65] Jordan: I did! Found a new thriller I'm excited to read. And a cute coffee mug.
[Message 66] Alex: Nice! I found a book on landscape design. Perfect for the spring.
[Message 67] Sam: Score! I snagged a vinyl record from one of my favorite bands.

[Message 75] Alex: Wait, before we leave, did either of you see the news about the new electric car that's coming out next year?
[Message 76] Jordan: Ooh, tell me more! I'm always interested in new cars.
[Message 77] Sam: I think I saw something about it. Isn't it supposed to have a super long range?
[Message 78] Alex: Yeah, apparently it can go like 500 miles on a single charge.
[Message 79] Jordan: Wow! That's incredible! My current car's range is awful.
[Message 80] Sam: Definitely something to consider when you're ready for a new one.
[Message 81] Alex: Agreed. Okay, pizza time now?
[Message 82] Jordan: Yes, please! I'm dreaming of pepperoni.
[Message 83] Sam: Let's get this pizza!

[Message 91] Sam: I'm just planning on relaxing, maybe catching up on some reading.
[Message 92] Alex: Sounds like a good mix.
[Message 93] Jordan: Family dinners can be... interesting. My family is quite opinionated.
[Message 94] Sam: I can imagine! Holidays are always an adventure.
[Message 95] Alex: Tell me about it. Trying to get everyone to agree on anything is impossible.
[Message 96] Jordan: Exactly! Especially when it comes to politics.
[Message 97] Sam: Oh, boy. Best to avoid those topics altogether.
[Message 98] Alex: Agreed. Stick to the weather or something equally bland.
[Message 99] Jordan: Good advice! I'll keep that in mind.
[Message 100] Sam: How's the pizza, Alex?
[Message 101] Alex: Delicious. Thanks for asking. A little greasy, but I don't mind.
[Message 102] Jordan: More for flavor!
[Message 103] Sam: Exactly! Speaking of flavor, has anyone tried that new ice cream place downtown? ""Sweet Surrender""?
[Message 104] Alex: No, I haven't. Is it any good?
[Message 105] Jordan: I heard it's amazing! They have all kinds of unique flavors.
[Message 106] Sam: I might have to check it out this weekend.
[Message 107] Alex: Let me know what you think!
[Message 108] Jordan: If I survive family dinner, I'll go with you!
[Message 109] Sam: Haha! Deal!
[Message 110] Alex: So, back to concerts... If they ever got Bruce Springsteen to play here in Worcester, I'd be there in a heartbeat.
[Message 111] Jordan: Oh, now that would be a show!
[Message 112] Sam: Definitely a bucket list concert.
[Message 113] Alex: Agreed. Okay, pizza coma setting in. I should probably head home soon.

[Message 2] RILEY: ""Yeah, insane. Two people dead? What a nightmare.""
[Message 3] CHLOE: ""I know, right? Makes you think twice about going out alone.""
[Message 4] RILEY: ""Seriously. Anyway, you still up for brunch tomorrow?""
[Message 5] CHLOE: ""Definitely! We need some normalcy after this.""
[Message 6] JAKE: ""Anyone know any details about what went down?""
[Message 7] RILEY: ""Just rumors, Jake. Don't get caught up in the gossip.""
[Message 8] JAKE: ""Hard not to. The Social Worker and Corrections Officer both died, both at the same time at the Public Restroom?""
[Message 9] CHLOE: ""Yeah, I heard their names were David and Marcus. Awful.""
[Message 10] RILEY: ""Terrible. My thoughts are with their families.""
[Message 11] JAKE: ""Did you guys see Sam yesterday? He was acting really weird.""
[Message 12] CHLOE: ""Sam? Weird how?""
[Message 13] JAKE: ""I don't know, jumpy. Said he needed to clear his head. I saw him leave the building at Late Afternoon yesterday.""
[Message 14] RILEY: ""Maybe he just had a bad day, Jake. Don't jump to conclusions.""
[Message 15] CHLOE: ""Yeah, I agree with Riley. Let's not start pointing fingers.""
[Message 16] JAKE: ""Okay, okay. Just saying, his behavior was off.""
[Message 17] RILEY: ""Speaking of off, did anyone hear from Kai? They've been MIA lately.""
[Message 18] CHLOE: ""Now that you mention it, no. Wonder what they're up to.""
[Message 19] JAKE: ""Kai always keeps to themselves. Probably nothing.""
[Message 20] RILEY: ""True. Anyway, gotta run. Talk tomorrow!""
[Message 21] CHLOE: ""See ya!""
[Message 22] JAKE: ""Later.""
[Message 23] CHLOE: ""So, Jake, what else did Sam say?""
[Message 24] JAKE: ""Nothing much. Just kept repeating that everything would be okay. Super cryptic.""
[Message 25] CHLOE: ""Hmm. You think he knew David? He always hated Social Worker.""
[Message 26] JAKE: ""Not sure. He worked with Marcus sometimes, I think.""
[Message 27] CHLOE: ""Okay. This is all just so messed up.""
[Message 28] JAKE: ""Tell me about it. Hope they catch whoever did this.""
[Message 29] CHLOE: ""Me too. They're going away for a long time for this. Its horrible.""
[Message 30] RILEY: ""Hey guys, sorry I dipped so fast. Had to deal with something at work.""
[Message 31] CHLOE: ""No worries! Everything okay?""
[Message 32] RILEY: ""Yeah, just some paperwork. This whole thing with David and Marcus has everyone on edge.""
[Message 33] JAKE: ""Yeah, Chloe and I were just talking about it. Sam was acting weird yesterday.""
[Message 34] RILEY: ""Weird how? Be specific, Jake.""
[Message 35] JAKE: ""Just jumpy. Said he had to clear his head. Left around Late Afternoon. I think he knew Corrections Officer.""
[Message 36] RILEY: ""Okay. I'll keep that in mind. Has anyone spoken to Kai?""
[Message 37] CHLOE: ""Not since yesterday. They've been pretty quiet.""
[Message 38] RILEY: ""Right. I'm going to head out for a bit. Need some fresh air.""
[Message 39] CHLOE: ""Okay, stay safe!""
[Message 40] JAKE: ""Yeah, be careful out there.""
[Message 41] RILEY: ""Always am.""
[Message 42] CHLOE: ""Jake, you think Kai could be involved somehow?""
[Message 43] JAKE: ""Nah, Kai's all talk, no action. Besides, Kai is trans, they would never hurt corrections officer like that.""
[Message 44] CHLOE: ""Maybe you're right. But something feels off about this whole thing.""
[Message 45] JAKE: ""Tell me about it. Hey, you free later? Wanna watch a movie?""
[Message 46] CHLOE: ""Sure, sounds good. I need a distraction.""
[Message 47] JAKE: ""Perfect. I'll bring the snacks.""
[Message 48] CHLOE: ""Cool! See ya then.""
[Message 49] RILEY: ""Okay, back. Just saw Kai at the store. They looked…different.""
[Message 50] CHLOE: ""Different how? Did you talk to them?""
[Message 51] RILEY: ""I tried, but they brushed me off. Said they were in a hurry.""
[Message 52] JAKE: ""See? Kai's just being Kai. Nothing to worry about.""
[Message 53] RILEY: ""Maybe. But they were buying Poisoning via inhalation at the store.""
[Message 54] CHLOE: ""Whoa, what? That's a little sus.""
[Message 55] JAKE: ""Maybe they're just cleaning? Let's not make assumptions.""
[Message 56] RILEY: ""True, but it's still weird timing, right?""
[Message 57] CHLOE: ""Definitely. I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this.""
[Message 58] JAKE: ""Look, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation. Let's just wait and see what the police find.""
[Message 59] RILEY: ""Fine, but I'm keeping an eye on Kai. Just in case.""
[Message 60] CHLOE: ""Me too. This is crazy.""
[Message 61] JAKE: ""Alright, alright. Everyone just needs to chill.""
[Message 62] RILEY: ""Easy for you to say, Jake.""
[Message 63] CHLOE: ""Yeah, you seem awfully calm about all this.""
[Message 64] JAKE: ""I'm just trying to be rational! Someone has to be.""
[Message 65] RILEY: ""Whatever. I'm going to do some research on this Poisoning via inhalation stuff.""
[Message 66] CHLOE: ""Good idea. Let me know if you find anything interesting.""
[Message 67] JAKE: ""I'm going to watch some TV. Need to take my mind off things.""
[Message 68] RILEY: ""Suit yourself.""
[Message 69] CHLOE: ""Have fun with that.""
[Message 70] RILEY: ""Hey, I found something. Apparently, a specific type of Poisoning via inhalation can mimic symptoms of a heart attack.""
[Message 71] CHLOE: ""Seriously? That's messed up. Could that be what happened to David and Marcus?""
[Message 72] RILEY: ""It's possible. And Kai was buying that stuff...""
[Message 73] JAKE: ""Guys, seriously, stop. You're scaring yourselves.""
[Message 74] CHLOE: ""Maybe we should tell the police about Kai?""
[Message 75] RILEY: ""I think we should. This is too big to ignore.""
[Message 76] JAKE: ""Wait, hold on. Let's just think about this for a minute. What if we're wrong?""
[Message 77] CHLOE: ""If we're wrong, we're wrong. But what if we're right and we do nothing?""
[Message 78] RILEY: ""Exactly. This is about David and Marcus. We owe it to them to say something.""
[Message 79] JAKE: ""Fine, fine. But I'm staying out of it. I don't want to get involved.""
[Message 80] CHLOE: ""Suit yourself, Jake. We're doing the right thing.""
[Message 81] RILEY: ""Agreed. I'm calling the police now.""
[Message 82] JAKE: ""Just...be careful, okay?""
[Message 83] CHLOE: ""We will. Thanks, Jake.""
[Message 84] RILEY: ""Called them. They're sending someone over to talk to us.""
[Message 85] CHLOE: ""Good. I hope they catch whoever did this soon.""
[Message 86] JAKE: ""Me too. This whole thing is just...awful.""
[Message 87] RILEY: ""Yeah. Hey, Chloe, remember when Kai said they wanted to get rid of him after being misgendered constantly?.""
[Message 88] CHLOE: ""Vaguely... You don't think they'd act on that, right?""
[Message 89] RILEY: ""I don't know anymore. The Poisoning via inhalation purchase, the weird behavior...it's all adding up.""
[Message 90] JAKE: ""Guys, seriously, you're going to ruin someone's life based on assumptions. Not cool.""
[Message 91] CHLOE: ""We're not trying to ruin anyone's life, Jake. We're trying to find out who killed David and Marcus.""
[Message 92] RILEY: ""Exactly. And if Kai is innocent, then they have nothing to worry about.""
[Message 93] JAKE: ""I still think you're making a mistake. This is going to backfire.""

238,"[Message 1] Alex: ""That wedding reception was...something. Anyone else still processing the groom's speech?""
[Message 2] Jamie: ""Oh god, Alex, don't remind me. I think I blocked it out. Cringiest thing I've witnessed in a while.""
[Message 3] River: ""I thought it was kind of sweet, in a totally awkward, unprepared way. At least he was genuine.""
[Message 4] Chris: ""Genuine and terrifyingly unfunny. Like, dad-joke level but without the self-awareness.""
[Message 5] Jordan: ""You guys are harsh! I thought it was endearing. Plus, the cake was amazing, right?""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Okay, the cake *was* good. Almost made up for the groom's tangent about his stamp collection.""
[Message 7] Jamie: ""Stamp collection? I missed that gem. I was too busy trying not to make eye contact with anyone.""
[Message 8] River: ""He mentioned it briefly. Something about a rare Prussian Blue. I tuned out.""
[Message 9] Chris: ""Prussian Blue? Sounds expensive. Maybe the wedding was financed by stamps.""
[Message 10] Jordan: ""Haha, maybe! Speaking of expensive, did anyone see the bride's dress? Stunning, but probably cost a fortune.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Definitely a fortune. I'm guessing six figures. Though, I'm pretty sure my security guard salary wouldn't cover the dry cleaning for that dress.""
[Message 12] Jamie: ""Probably not, Alex. But hey, at least you have the best stories from the mall after hours, right?""
[Message 13] Alex: ""True. Saw a guy try to steal a mannequin last week. Now *that's* a wedding story.""
[Message 14] River: ""A mannequin? Seriously? What was his plan?""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Said he needed a date. Tragic and hilarious all at once.""
[Message 16] Chris: ""Okay, that's way better than the stamp collection story. I'm officially team Mannequin Thief.""
[Message 17] Jordan: ""You guys are incorrigible! Back to the wedding – anyone tear up during the vows?""
[Message 18] Jamie: ""Almost. When his grandma started crying, I felt a little something. I'm a sucker for grandmas.""
[Message 19] River: ""Me too. Grandmas are the best. Especially when they sneak you extra cookies.""
[Message 20] Chris: ""Speaking of cookies... I'm suddenly craving chocolate chip. Anyone else?""
[Message 21] Jordan: ""Always! I could eat chocolate chip cookies for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.""
[Message 22] Alex: ""Now you're talking my language. Although, I’m more of a peanut butter cookie guy myself.""
[Message 23] Jamie: ""Peanut butter? You're a brave soul, Alex. Allergies are everywhere these days.""
[Message 24] Alex: ""True. But I live on the edge, Jamie. You know this. It's the security guard life.""
[Message 25] River: ""I’m partial to oatmeal raisin. Fight me.""
[Message 26] Chris: ""Oatmeal raisin?! River, I thought we were friends!""
[Message 27] Jordan: ""Okay, let's not start a cookie war. Can't we all just agree that cookies are delicious?""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""Agreed. All cookies are created equal. Except maybe those weird anise ones.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Anise cookies... Now *that's* a truly terrifying wedding reception experience.""
[Message 30] River: ""Haha, true. I saw those. Avoided them like the plague.""
[Message 31] Chris: ""Okay, back to the original topic. Groom's speech. Rate it 1-10. 1 being a masterpiece, 10 being a train wreck.""
[Message 32] Jordan: ""I'd say a 5. Middle of the road. Not great, not terrible.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""8. It was painful to watch. Like a slow-motion car crash.""
[Message 34] Jamie: ""9. The stamp collection sealed its fate. Almost walked out.""
[Message 35] River: ""6. I'm feeling generous. He tried.""
[Message 36] Chris: ""Okay, so overall, a resounding 'meh'. Glad we're all on the same page.""
[Message 37] Jordan: ""Well, at least the bride seemed happy. That's what matters, right?""
[Message 38] Alex: ""True. As long as she's happy. And has a good sense of humor.""
[Message 39] Jamie: ""And a lifetime supply of stamps, apparently.""
[Message 40] River: ""Maybe she's a philatelist? You never know.""
[Message 41] Chris: ""A philatelist? Is that even a word? Sounds like something from Harry Potter.""
[Message 42] Jordan: ""It's a real word! It means someone who collects stamps.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""You learn something new every day. Even from a wedding reception conversation gone sideways.""
[Message 44] Jamie: ""Speaking of sideways, I'm starting to feel a bit sleepy. Long day of wrenching on cars.""
[Message 45] River: ""Me too. I’ve got an early morning tomorrow, gotta get back to those electrical panels.""
[Message 46] Chris: ""Yeah, I should probably head out as well. Need to prep for my patients tomorrow.""
[Message 47] Jordan: ""Alright everyone, it was fun rehashing the wedding. Maybe we can do this again soon?""
[Message 48] Alex: ""Sounds good to me. Next time, no stamp collections, please.""
[Message 49] Jamie: ""Deal. And fewer anise cookies.""

[Message 2] Mark: Yeah, it's all over the news. Crazy. Two people dead.

[Message 3] Emily: I know, right? So awful. Anyone know who the victims were?

[Message 4] Sarah: They're saying a 16-year-old and a Corrections Officer.

[Message 5] David: Corrections Officer? Wow. That's intense. You think it was work-related?

[Message 6] Mark: Could be. Or just a random act of violence. Syracuse is getting rough.

[Message 7] Emily: I heard one was named Ashley. Poor Ashley. So young.

[Message 8] David: Ashley, huh? I don't think I knew her.

[Message 9] Sarah: I saw Carol leaving Doctor's Office around Sunset yesterday. Weird.

[Message 10] Mark: Carol? Seriously? What was she doing there?

[Message 11] Emily: She said she had an appointment for her foot. I think she mentioned something like physical therapy.

[Message 12] David: Carol and Ashley? Different crowds.

[Message 13] Sarah: That's what I thought. Just seemed odd. I went to visit my grandma, its been a while.

[Message 14] Mark: Yeah, Carol's got that clubfoot thing, right? Prob needed therapy.

[Message 15] Emily: Poor thing. I can't imagine living with that.

[Message 16] David: So, anything else on the news about it?

[Message 17] Sarah: They're not saying much. Just that they're investigating. They have few suspects.

[Message 18] Mark: Probably some psycho off the streets.

[Message 19] Emily: I hope they catch whoever did it.

[Message 20] David: Me too. So, anyone up for grabbing some pizza later?

[Message 21] Sarah: I'm in! Need something to take my mind off this.

[Message 24] David: Alright, cool. 7 PM at Nino's?

[Message 25] Sarah: Perfect.

[Message 26] Mark: See you guys then.

[Message 27] Emily: Later.

[Message 28] Sarah: Hey Mark, did you see Jason yesterday? I needed to ask him about something.

[Message 29] Mark: Nah, didn't see him. He's been pretty MIA lately.

[Message 30] David: I saw Jason at the bar. He was talking about how he hated Corrections Officers.

[Message 31] Emily: Oh dear. Why?

[Message 32] David: Apparently, one gave his brother a hard time in prison.

[Message 33] Sarah: That's... concerning.

[Message 34] Mark: Eh, Jason always exaggerates. He probably didn't mean anything by it.

[Message 35] Emily: Still, bad timing, right?

[Message 36] David: Yeah, you could say that. Anyway pizza?

[Message 37] Sarah: Let’s just try to relax at pizza, okay?

[Message 38] Mark: Agreed.

[Message 39] Emily: Okay.

[Message 40] Sarah: Hey Emily, did you know the other victim was named Sam?

[Message 41] Emily: Sam? No, I didn't. I thought it was just Ashley.

[Message 42] David: I heard Sam was trans.

[Message 43] Mark: Really? News travels fast.

[Message 44] Sarah: I saw Jason looking up how to make Drowning in a bathtub online last week.

[Message 45] Emily: Whoa, Sarah! Seriously? Why didn't you say something before?

[Message 46] David: What the hell, Sarah?! Now I'm starting to worry about what I said at the bar.

[Message 47] Mark: Hold on, hold on. Let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe he was just doing research for a story or something.

[Message 48] Sarah: He's not a writer, Mark. And I intended not to say anything, but this is going too far.

[Message 49] Emily: I'm feeling really uneasy now. I think we should tell the police about Jason.

[Message 50] David: Agreed. This is getting way too serious.

[Message 51] Mark: Alright, alright. But let's all go together, okay? Strength in numbers.

[Message 52] Sarah: Deal.

[Message 53] Emily: Okay. When?

[Message 54] David: How about tomorrow morning? First thing?

[Message 55] Sarah: Sounds good.

[Message 56] Mark: Fine by me.

[Message 57] Emily: Okay, see you all then.

[Message 58] Mark: Hey, Emily, can I ask you something in private?

[Message 59] Emily: Sure, what's up?

[Message 60] Mark: Do you really think Jason could have done it? I mean, I know he's got a temper, but murder?

[Message 61] Emily: I don't know, Mark. But Sarah's message freaked me out. And David's comment about the bar...

[Message 62] Mark: I know, it doesn't look good. But what if we're wrong? We could ruin his life.

[Message 63] Emily: And what if we're right and he hurts someone else? I don't know, Mark. I'm so confused.

[Message 64] Mark: Me too. Okay, let's just see what the police say tomorrow. We'll tell them everything we know, and they can decide.

[Message 65] Emily: Okay, that sounds fair.

[Message 66] Mark: Good. Thanks for listening, Emily.

[Message 67] Emily: Anytime, Mark. We're in this together.

[Message 68] Sarah: You guys still going for pizza later?

[Message 69] Mark: Nah, Emily and I are gonna pass. Too much on our minds.

[Message 70] Sarah: Oh. Okay. Well, you guys take care. David and I will go.

[Message 71] Emily: You too, Sarah.

[Message 72] David: See ya.

[Message 73] Sarah: I really didn’t like Sam. He was always being mean.

[Message 2] Alex: Yeah, crazy. Poor Chris. Security Guard wasn't even that old.
[Message 3] Maya: I know, right? Were you anywhere near there at noon?
[Message 4] Alex: Nah, I was at the dentist. Root canal, ugh. You?
[Message 5] Maya: Library, researching for my history paper. Super boring.
[Message 6] Alex: History, huh? What's the topic?
[Message 7] Maya: The Russian Revolution. Irony, given where we are. Lol.
[Message 8] Alex: Haha, true. Hey, did you see Jamie around today?
[Message 9] Maya: Jamie? No, why?
[Message 10] Alex: Just wondering. They were acting weird yesterday. Said they needed to ""take care of something important.""
[Message 11] Maya: Weird. Maybe they were skipping class?
[Message 12] Alex: Maybe. But Jamie seemed…intense.
[Message 13] Maya: Don't overthink it, Alex. Everyone's on edge now.
[Message 14] Alex: True. Want to grab coffee later? Need to de-stress.
[Message 15] Maya: Sure. Around 4?
[Message 16] Alex: Perfect. Later!
[Message 17] Maya: Later.
[Message 18] Ben: Maya, you free to talk?
[Message 19] Maya: Ben? Yeah, what's up? Everything okay?
[Message 20] Ben: Not really. I saw Kai arguing with Chris yesterday near the back entrance.
[Message 21] Maya: Kai? Really? About what?
[Message 22] Ben: Sounded like business. Something about money. Kai looked pissed.
[Message 23] Maya: Wow. Kai always seemed so calm.
[Message 24] Ben: People hide things. I just…I don't trust Kai. They always hated 2.  Security Guard.
[Message 25] Maya: Did you tell the police?
[Message 26] Ben: I don't want to get involved. Just thought you should know.
[Message 27] Maya: Thanks, Ben. I appreciate it.
[Message 28] Ben: Be careful, Maya. This whole thing is messed up.
[Message 29] Maya: I will. You too.
[Message 30] Alex: Hey, running late. See you at 4:30?
[Message 31] Maya: No problem. See you then.
[Message 32] Jamie: Alex, can we talk? It's important.
[Message 33] Alex: Uh, sure. What's going on?
[Message 34] Jamie: I need to tell someone. I saw Zara near Chris’s usual spot at like, 11:45.
[Message 35] Alex: Zara? What was she doing?
[Message 36] Jamie: I don't know, pacing. Looking anxious.
[Message 37] Alex: Did she see Chris?
[Message 38] Jamie: I don't think so. I didn’t see them interact.
[Message 39] Alex: This is getting crazy. You should tell the police, Jamie.
[Message 40] Jamie: No way. I can't get involved. Just…be careful, okay?
[Message 41] Alex: You too.
[Message 42] Zara: Alex, you wouldn't believe the day I'm having.
[Message 43] Alex: Oh yeah? What happened?
[Message 44] Zara: My car broke down on the way to school this morning. Had to call a tow truck.
[Message 45] Alex: Seriously? Where were you when it happened?
[Message 46] Zara: On 54th Ave, about 20 minutes from school. I intended to be there by noon, but...
[Message 47] Alex: That sucks. Missed all the chaos, at least.
[Message 48] Zara: Yeah, silver lining, I guess. I heard Chris was found around noon?
[Message 49] Alex: That's what they're saying.
[Message 50] Kai: Alex, you there?
[Message 51] Alex: Yeah, what's up Kai?
[Message 52] Kai: I heard the police are asking questions. Just wanted to say, if they ask about me, I was in a meeting all morning.
[Message 53] Alex: A meeting? With who?
[Message 54] Kai: Some clients. Doesn't matter. Just…cover for me, okay? I really need you to say that I saw him leave the building at Noon.
[Message 55] Alex: I don't know, Kai. That feels wrong.
[Message 56] Kai: Please, Alex. I'm begging you. This could ruin my life. They’re going away for a long time for this.
[Message 57] Alex: What did you do, Kai?
[Message 58] Kai: Nothing! I swear. Just…trust me.

[Message 2] DAVID: ""Yeah, crazy stuff. A judge, right? Poor woman.""
[Message 3] ANNA: ""I know! So awful. I was just there yesterday.""
[Message 4] BEN: ""Terrible. Another reason to stay home.""
[Message 5] ELIZA: ""Who was it? Anyone know the details?""
[Message 6] CHLOE: ""It was 8.  Judge Miller. Found dead in the parking lot.""
[Message 7] DAVID: ""Parking lot? Seriously? In broad daylight?""
[Message 8] ANNA: ""Yeah, Midday, apparently. So scary.""
[Message 9] BEN: ""Midday? Someone is bold.""
[Message 10] ELIZA: ""They're saying it was a Using a garrote, Chloe, is that true?""
[Message 11] CHLOE: ""I heard that too, Eliza. How awful is that? I heard they are blaming Jackson.""
[Message 12] DAVID: ""Jackson? I know him! The self-defense instructor? What are they saying?""
[Message 13] ANNA: ""Something about him being at the mall that day. He always hated 8.  Judge. Maybe because of the court case?""
[Message 14] BEN: ""Jackson? Really? Seemed harmless enough.""
[Message 15] ELIZA: ""He's got a history though, right? I heard he was mentally unstable.""
[Message 16] CHLOE: ""Yeah, that's what I heard, Eliza. But you can't just assume he did it!""
[Message 17] DAVID: ""True, but it doesn't look good for him. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""
[Message 18] ANNA: ""Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe it was someone else. What about Maria?""
[Message 19] BEN: ""Maria? Why Maria?""
[Message 20] ELIZA: ""Maria is always so jealous and competitive. Maybe she was planning something?""
[Message 21] CHLOE: ""I don't know, Eliza, Maria seems focused on her career.""
[Message 22] DAVID: ""Well, 8.  Judge Miller was getting in the way of that career.""
[Message 23] ANNA: ""True, but Maria isn't exactly physically intimidating. Using a garrote seems… intense.""
[Message 24] BEN: ""Maybe she had help.""
[Message 25] ELIZA: ""Okay, now you're thinking. Let's not forget about political stuff too. I remember her talking about eliminating a romantic rival.""
[Message 26] CHLOE: ""Maybe it was a political thing. 8.  Judge Miller was involved in some high-profile cases.""
[Message 27] DAVID: ""That could be it. Someone wanted her silenced.""
[Message 28] ANNA: ""So, who benefits most from her death? That's what the cops should be asking.""
[Message 29] BEN: ""Good point, Anna. Follow the money.""
[Message 30] ELIZA: ""Or the power. 8.  Judge Miller had plenty of that.""
[Message 31] CHLOE: ""This is all so messed up. I can't believe it happened.""
[Message 32] DAVID: ""Yeah, it's really unsettling.""
[Message 33] ANNA: ""We should all be careful. You never know who's capable of what.""
[Message 34] BEN: ""Agreed. Stay safe, everyone.""
[Message 35] ELIZA: ""You too, Ben. Let's keep each other updated if we hear anything.""
[Message 36] CHLOE: ""Okay, guys. Talk soon.""
[Message 37] DAVID: ""Later.""
[Message 38] ANNA: ""Bye.""
[Message 39] BEN: ""Peace.""
[Message 40] CHLOE: ""Did anyone know 8.  Judge Miller personally?""
[Message 41] DAVID: ""I met her once at a charity event. Seemed nice enough, if a bit...anxious.""
[Message 42] ANNA: ""I saw her at the mall sometimes. Always looked stressed.""
[Message 43] BEN: ""I never met her. I stay out of the legal world.""
[Message 44] ELIZA: ""My cousin worked on one of her cases. Said she was tough but fair.""
[Message 45] CHLOE: ""So, no one here had any reason to… you know.""
[Message 46] DAVID: ""Definitely not me. I barely knew her.""
[Message 47] ANNA: ""Me neither. This is just awful.""
[Message 48] BEN: ""Nope. I'm an innocent bystander.""
[Message 49] ELIZA: ""I didn't even know her that well. But it has to be a professional hit.""
[Message 50] CHLOE: ""Professional hit? That's scary.""
[Message 51] DAVID: ""Yeah, that means someone paid for it.""
[Message 52] ANNA: ""More reason to be careful.""
[Message 53] BEN: ""Absolutely. Lock your doors.""
[Message 54] ELIZA: ""Or maybe it was a crime of passion? Someone she knew well?""
[Message 55] CHLOE: ""That's possible too. So many possibilities.""
[Message 56] DAVID: ""The cops have their work cut out for them.""
[Message 57] ANNA: ""They need to find the killer fast.""
[Message 58] BEN: ""Before they strike again.""
[Message 59] ELIZA: ""They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 60] CHLOE: ""Hey, unrelated, anyone watching that new show on Netflix?""
[Message 61] DAVID: ""Which one? I'm always looking for something new.""
[Message 62] ANNA: ""Is it any good?""
[Message 63] BEN: ""Tell me more...""
[Message 64] ELIZA: ""Maybe later, guys. Let's focus on this for now. So Jackson, what do we know about him?""
[Message 65] CHLOE: ""Ok. But he has a high-pitched voice that you cant just use as evidence. I think he is being framed.""
[Message 66] DAVID: ""I heard he was fired from his last job for being unstable.""
[Message 67] ANNA: ""That's not good. That adds to his motivation.""
[Message 68] BEN: ""Was he fired by 8.  Judge Miller?""
[Message 69] ELIZA: ""I don't think so, Ben. Different job.""
[Message 70] CHLOE: ""Guys, can we not spend the whole day talking about this murder?""
[Message 71] DAVID: ""Sorry, Chloe. It's just… shocking.""
[Message 72] ANNA: ""Yeah, it's hard to think about anything else.""
[Message 73] BEN: ""Understood.""
[Message 74] ELIZA: ""No worries, Chloe. We'll change the subject soon.""
[Message 75] CHLOE: ""Thanks. So, anyone got plans for the weekend?""
[Message 76] DAVID: ""Thinking about going hiking.""
[Message 77] ANNA: ""Maybe a movie night.""
[Message 78] BEN: ""I'll be working.""
[Message 79] ELIZA: ""I might visit my sister.""
[Message 80] CHLOE: ""Sounds fun, everyone. Be safe though!""
[Message 81] DAVID: ""Always.""
[Message 82] ANNA: ""Of course.""
[Message 83] BEN: ""I'm always safe.""
[Message 84] ELIZA: ""You too, Chloe.""
[Message 85] CHLOE: ""So Maria, anyone know if she had any beef with 8.  Judge Miller?""
[Message 86] DAVID: ""Rumor has it, they were competing for the same promotion.""
[Message 87] ANNA: ""That's a pretty big motive.""
[Message 88] BEN: ""Especially if Maria intended to win.""
[Message 89] ELIZA: ""Did anyone see Maria at the mall that day?""
[Message 90] CHLOE: ""Good question, Eliza. Anyone?""
[Message 91] DAVID: ""I wasn't there.""
[Message 92] ANNA: ""Me neither.""
[Message 93] BEN: ""Nope.""
[Message 94] ELIZA: ""I was at home all day.""
[Message 95] CHLOE: ""So no alibis for Maria then?""
[Message 96] DAVID: ""Not from us, at least.""
[Message 97] ANNA: ""The police will have to investigate.""
[Message 98] BEN: ""They'll check the security cameras.""
[Message 99] ELIZA: ""Hopefully, they find something.""
[Message 100] CHLOE: ""Yeah, this is all so unsettling.""
[Message 101] DAVID: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 102] ANNA: ""I can't stop thinking about it.""
[Message 103] BEN: ""Try to relax, guys.""
[Message 104] ELIZA: ""Easier said than done, Ben.""
[Message 105] CHLOE: ""Hey, did anyone see that weird post Jackson made on Facebook last week?""
[Message 106] DAVID: ""No, what was it?""
[Message 107] ANNA: ""I missed it too.""
[Message 108] BEN: ""Spill the tea, Chloe.""
[Message 109] ELIZA: ""I saw it. Something about 'getting rid of obstacles.'""
[Message 110] CHLOE: ""Yeah! That's the one! Super creepy in hindsight.""
[Message 111] DAVID: ""Wow, that's pretty damning.""
[Message 112] ANNA: ""He was looking up how to make Using a garrote online. Didnt he?""
[Message 113] BEN: ""Definitely makes him look guilty.""
[Message 114] ELIZA: ""Maybe it's a coincidence? But that post is very scary.""
[Message 115] CHLOE: ""I know, right? It's hard to ignore.""
[Message 116] DAVID: ""He might have tried to talk him out of it.""
[Message 117] ANNA: ""Lets let the cops do their work.""
[Message 118] BEN: ""Agreed. We're just speculating.""
[Message 119] ELIZA: ""True, but it's hard not to.""
[Message 120] CHLOE: ""I know, Eliza. I know.""
[Message 121] DAVID: ""Anyone else find it weird that Eliza keeps bringing up the political angle?""
[Message 122] ANNA: ""Now that you mention it…""
[Message 123] BEN: ""Good point, David. Why are you so focused on that, Eliza?""
[Message 124] ELIZA: ""I'm just saying it's a possibility. 8.  Judge Miller was involved in some controversial cases. And she was buying Using a garrote at the store.""
[Message 125] CHLOE: ""Fair enough, Eliza.""
[Message 126] DAVID: ""But Maria seems more likely at this point. She had the motive.""
[Message 127] ANNA: ""And the opportunity, maybe.""
[Message 128] BEN: ""So, it's down to Jackson and Maria?""
[Message 129] ELIZA: ""Or a combination of factors. Maybe they both had a hand in it.""
[Message 130] CHLOE: ""Guys, that's a bit far-fetched.""
[Message 131] DAVID: ""You never know. People do crazy things.""
[Message 132] ANNA: ""It might have been self-defense maybe?""
[Message 133] BEN: ""Not with a Using a garrote.""
[Message 134] ELIZA: ""8.  Judge Miller was actually a close family member of someone that I know. Does that look suspicious?""
[Message 135] CHLOE: ""Eliza, are you trying to distract us? What’s really going on?""
[Message 136] DAVID: ""Yeah, Eliza, what is really going on?""
[Message 137] ANNA: ""Guys stop accusing Eliza, we don't even know that information.""
[Message 138] BEN: ""She does seem a bit defensive.""
[Message 139] ELIZA: ""Okay, fine! I saw Jackson leave the building at Midday. But I didn’t see anything else, I swear!""
[Message 140] CHLOE: ""Eliza! Why didn't you say something earlier?! That’s huge!""
[Message 141] DAVID: ""Eliza, are you covering for someone?""
[Message 142] ANNA: ""This is getting intense.""
[Message 143] BEN: ""Why would you hide that, Eliza?""
[Message 144] ELIZA: ""I panicked, okay? I didn't want to get involved.""
[Message 145] CHLOE: ""Involved? You saw a potential suspect leaving the scene!""
[Message 146] DAVID: ""This changes everything.""
[Message 147] ANNA: ""We need to tell the police, Eliza.""
[Message 148] BEN: ""Immediately.""
[Message 149] ELIZA: ""Okay, okay, I'll call them. But please, don't judge me.""
[Message 150] CHLOE: ""I’m not judging you; I’m trying to understand.""
[Message 151] DAVID: ""Just tell the truth to the police.""
[Message 152] ANNA: ""This is serious, Eliza.""

[Message 161] DAVID: ""No, I haven't.""
[Message 162] ANNA: ""Neither have I.""
[Message 163] BEN: ""That is suspicious too.""
[Message 164] ELIZA: ""Maybe she's laying low.""
[Message 165] CHLOE: ""Maybe she should’ve called 911 after the victim was hurt.""

245,"[Message 1] Alex: Good morning, everyone! Anyone catching the Pacers game tonight?
[Message 2] Bailey: Morning, Alex! I might. Depends on if I can get the truck unloaded early enough.
[Message 3] Casey: Morning! Pacers are playing? Thought they were off-season.
[Message 4] Dakota: Casey, pre-season games are happening now. Tune-up time!
[Message 5] Echo: Morning all. I'm more of a Colts fan, but I'll check the score.
[Message 6] Alex: True, Dakota! Pre-season hype! Echo, fair enough. Colts are looking promising this year.
[Message 7] Bailey: Pacers need some serious work this year, I think.
[Message 8] Casey: Work? They need a miracle!
[Message 9] Dakota: Casey, don't be so negative! They've got some new blood.
[Message 10] Echo: New blood doesn't always translate to wins. Gotta have chemistry.
[Message 11] Alex: Agreed, Echo. Chemistry is key. Remember the early Bird years?
[Message 12] Bailey: Bird years? I remember driving a truck with no AC back then! Times were different.
[Message 13] Casey: No AC? Ouch. I'd rather watch the Pacers lose than drive without AC.
[Message 14] Dakota: Anyone know if they're selling those new jerseys at the Coliseum tonight?
[Message 15] Echo: Probably, Dakota. Check their website.
[Message 16] Alex: Good call, Echo. Worth a look. Speaking of looking... anyone know the quickest way to Front Porch from here?
[Message 17] Bailey: Front Porch? Head north on Clinton Street, then take a left on State. Can't miss it.
[Message 18] Casey: Yeah, Bailey's right. It's pretty straightforward.
[Message 19] Dakota: Thanks, guys! Appreciate it. Back to basketball, any predictions for tonight's score?
[Message 20] Echo: Too early to tell, Dakota. Just hoping for a good game.
[Message 21] Alex: I'm predicting a close one. Maybe a 5-point win for the Pacers, if they're lucky.
[Message 22] Bailey: 5 points? Optimistic, Alex. I'm saying they lose by 10.
[Message 23] Casey: Lose by 20. Minimum.
[Message 24] Dakota: You guys are brutal! I'm sticking with Alex's optimism.
[Message 25] Echo: We'll see. I'll be happy if they just show some effort.
[Message 26] Alex: Effort is all I ask for! And maybe a few less turnovers.
[Message 27] Bailey: Turnovers are their specialty.
[Message 28] Casey: They're consistently inconsistent. That's their specialty.
[Message 29] Dakota: Okay, okay, we get it. You're not fans.
[Message 30] Echo: Not *completely* not fans. Just...realistic.
[Message 31] Alex: Realistic pessimism. I like it.
[Message 32] Bailey: Hey, I saw a good fishing spot down by the river the other day. Anyone interested in checking it out this weekend?
[Message 33] Casey: Fishing? Sounds... peaceful. I'm more of a cooking-at-home kind of guy.
[Message 34] Dakota: I'm terrible at fishing, but thanks for the invite, Bailey!
[Message 35] Echo: I might be interested, Bailey. Depends on the weather.
[Message 36] Alex: Fishing's not my thing, but I appreciate the offer. Back to sports, anyone following the high school football games?
[Message 37] Bailey: My nephew's playing for North Side this year.
[Message 38] Casey: Oh, nice! North Side's got a decent team.
[Message 39] Dakota: Good luck to your nephew, Bailey!
[Message 40] Echo: High school football is a classic. Always a fun atmosphere.
[Message 41] Alex: Absolutely, Echo. Friday night lights!
[Message 42] Bailey: He's a linebacker. Pretty tough kid.
[Message 43] Casey: Linebacker, huh? That's a good position to be in.
[Message 44] Dakota: Hopefully he stays safe out there.
[Message 45] Echo: Safety first, always.
[Message 46] Alex: Agreed. Concussions are a serious issue.
[Message 47] Bailey: They are. He's wearing all the proper gear, though.
[Message 48] Casey: Good to hear.
[Message 49] Dakota: So, anyone else have any pre-game rituals for watching sports?
[Message 50] Echo: I usually just make sure I have snacks.
[Message 51] Alex: Snacks are essential! And a good playlist.
[Message 52] Bailey: Just a cold beer for me.
[Message 53] Casey: I like to have all my ingredients prepped for whatever I'm cooking.
[Message 54] Dakota: I usually wear my lucky jersey, even if it's faded.
[Message 55] Echo: Lucky jersey! That's a good one.
[Message 56] Alex: Love the lucky jersey, Dakota!
[Message 57] Bailey: Hey, anyone know a good place to get my car inspected?
[Message 58] Casey: Bailey, you're a mechanic! Don't you do your own inspections?
[Message 59] Dakota: Yeah, that's what I was thinking, Casey.
[Message 60] Echo: Maybe he's looking for a second opinion?
[Message 61] Alex: Or maybe he's just trying to drum up business.
[Message 62] Bailey: Haha, no, I'm just swamped right now. Need to find someone reliable to take it to.
[Message 63] Casey: There's that place on Washington Blvd. They're pretty good.
[Message 64] Dakota: I've heard good things about them too.
[Message 65] Echo: Washington Blvd is a decent bet.
[Message 66] Alex: Thanks for the tip!
[Message 67] Bailey: Appreciate it, guys!
[Message 68] Casey: No problem!
[Message 69] Dakota: Always happy to help.
[Message 70] Echo: Anytime.
[Message 71] Alex: Back to sports! What about the TinCaps? Anyone catch their game last night?
[Message 72] Bailey: TinCaps are always fun.
[Message 73] Casey: I enjoy a good baseball game.
[Message 74] Dakota: Family friendly entertainment.
[Message 75] Echo: A classic summer pastime.
[Message 76] Alex: Exactly, Echo. And Parkview Field is a great venue.
[Message 77] Bailey: Agreed. They did a good job with that stadium.
[Message 78] Casey: Much better than the old Memorial Stadium.
[Message 79] Dakota: Definitely a step up.
[Message 80] Echo: A welcome addition to downtown.
[Message 81] Alex: Agreed all around.
[Message 82] Bailey: So, anyone planning on going to any of the games this weekend?
[Message 83] Casey: I might. Depends on my schedule.
[Message 84] Dakota: I'm thinking about it.
[Message 85] Echo: Possibly.
[Message 86] Alex: I'll check their schedule.
[Message 87] Bailey: Worth a look.
[Message 88] Casey: They usually have some good promotions.
[Message 89] Dakota: Like the fireworks nights.
[Message 90] Echo: Those are always popular.
[Message 91] Alex: Definitely.
[Message 92] Bailey: Alright, I gotta get back to work.
[Message 93] Casey: Same here.
[Message 94] Dakota: Catch you all later!
[Message 95] Echo: Have a good one!
[Message 96] Alex: Talk to you later, everyone!
[Message 97] Bailey: Later.
[Message 98] Casey: Bye.
[Message 99] Dakota: Adios.
[Message 100] Echo: Goodbye.
[Message 101] Alex: Anyone know what channel the game is on tonight?
[Message 102] Bailey: Probably Comcast channel 81.
[Message 103] Casey: Thanks, Bailey!
[Message 104] Dakota: Appreciate it!
[Message 105] Echo: Helpful!
[Message 106] Alex: You're a lifesaver!
[Message 107] Bailey: No problem. Always happy to help.
[Message 108] Casey: So, what's everyone having for dinner tonight?
[Message 109] Dakota: Probably pizza. Easy and quick.
[Message 110] Echo: I'm thinking about making a stir-fry.
[Message 111] Alex: I might order some takeout. Haven't decided yet.
[Message 112] Bailey: I'll probably just grill some burgers.
[Message 113] Casey: Stir-fry sounds good, Echo.
[Message 114] Dakota: Burgers are always a classic, Bailey.
[Message 115] Echo: Yeah, I'm craving something healthy.
[Message 116] Alex: Pizza sounds good too, Dakota.
[Message 117] Bailey: Can't go wrong with a burger.
[Message 118] Casey: True.
[Message 119] Dakota: What kind of stir-fry are you making, Echo?
[Message 120] Echo: Probably just a simple chicken and veggie stir-fry with soy sauce.
[Message 121] Alex: Sounds delicious!
[Message 122] Bailey: Makes me hungry!
[Message 123] Casey: Definitely.
[Message 124] Dakota: Me too!
[Message 125] Echo: I'll have to share the recipe sometime.
[Message 126] Alex: That would be great!
[Message 127] Bailey: Appreciated!
[Message 128] Casey: Awesome!
[Message 129] Dakota: Yes, please!
[Message 130] Echo: Alright, will do!
[Message 131] Alex: So, back to the Pacers... what are their biggest weaknesses?
[Message 132] Bailey: Defense. Hands down.
[Message 133] Casey: Agreed. They can't stop anyone.
[Message 134] Dakota: Their rebounding could use some work too.
[Message 135] Echo: Definitely need to improve on defense and rebounding.
[Message 136] Alex: Those are the two biggest things, for sure.
[Message 137] Bailey: If they can fix those, they might have a chance.
[Message 138] Casey: It's a big ""if.""
[Message 139] Dakota: A very big ""if.""
[Message 140] Echo: But we can hope!
[Message 141] Alex: Hope springs eternal!
[Message 142] Bailey: That's the spirit!
[Message 143] Casey: Alright, gotta run. Talk to you all later!
[Message 144] Dakota: Bye!

246,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone! Just leaving the electronics store. Anyone else thinking about volunteering more this year?
[Message 2] Ben: Hey Alex! Yeah, I've been meaning to. What kind of volunteering are you interested in?
[Message 3] Casey: I'm always up for volunteering! I find it really rewarding.
[Message 4] Dana: Volunteering is great! I've been thinking about it too, but finding the time is always a challenge.
[Message 5] Ethan: Hey all. Volunteering is a good cause. Depends what's available, though.
[Message 6] Alex: I'm not sure yet, Ben. Maybe something with animals or the environment? Open to suggestions!
[Message 7] Ben: The animal shelter in Spokane is always looking for volunteers. They need people to walk dogs and clean cages.
[Message 8] Casey: I used to volunteer at a food bank. It's definitely eye-opening.
[Message 9] Dana: That sounds like a great idea, Casey. I might look into that.
[Message 10] Ethan: I saw something about volunteering at the library. Helping with kids' reading programs.
[Message 11] Alex: Oh, the library program sounds cool, Ethan. I could check that out.
[Message 12] Ben: I'm more of an outdoorsy person, so the animal shelter is appealing.
[Message 13] Casey: My niece just got a new puppy. She’s obsessed!
[Message 14] Dana: Aww, puppies are the best!
[Message 15] Ethan: My neighbor volunteers at the senior center. Says they always need help with activities.
[Message 16] Alex: A senior center could be good too. I enjoy hearing their stories.
[Message 17] Ben: Okay, animal shelter it is for me! I'll look into their volunteer orientation.
[Message 18] Casey: Good for you, Ben!
[Message 19] Dana: Maybe we could all volunteer somewhere together?
[Message 20] Ethan: That could be fun, Dana. Coordinate schedules, though.
[Message 21] Alex: That’s a great idea, Dana! We could try to find something we all like.
[Message 22] Ben: Count me in! Let's see what options are out there.
[Message 23] Casey: I'm flexible. I'm happy to join whatever you guys decide on.
[Message 24] Dana: Awesome! I'll start looking for some opportunities.
[Message 25] Ethan: Sounds like a plan. I'll keep an eye out too.
[Message 26] Alex: Perfect! Thanks, everyone.
[Message 27] Ben: No problem!
[Message 28] Casey: Anytime!
[Message 29] Dana: You got it!
[Message 30] Ethan: 👍
[Message 31] Alex: By the way, did anyone see the new season of that show ""Cosmic Explorers""?
[Message 32] Ben: Cosmic Explorers? Nah, I'm more into car shows.
[Message 33] Casey: I love that show, Alex! The special effects are amazing.
[Message 34] Dana: I've heard good things about it. Maybe I'll check it out.
[Message 35] Ethan: Not my cup of tea. Back to volunteering…maybe the food bank?
[Message 36] Alex: Yeah, the new season is pretty great, Casey. But back to volunteering – food bank sounds good, Ethan.
[Message 37] Ben: Food bank is alright. It's a good way to give back.
[Message 38] Casey: Definitely a worthwhile cause.
[Message 39] Dana: Okay, food bank is on the list!
[Message 40] Ethan: Let's check out the food bank's website for volunteer information.
[Message 41] Alex: Sounds good! I'll look it up.
[Message 42] Ben: Me too.
[Message 43] Casey: Awesome!
[Message 44] Dana: 👍
[Message 45] Ethan: 👍
[Message 46] Alex: Okay, I found their website. They need volunteers for sorting donations, packing boxes, and distributing food.
[Message 47] Ben: Sorting donations sounds manageable.
[Message 48] Casey: I'm good with packing boxes.
[Message 49] Dana: Distributing food could be interesting.
[Message 50] Ethan: I'm okay with any of those tasks.
[Message 51] Alex: It looks like they have different shifts available, so we can choose one that works for us.
[Message 52] Ben: That's convenient.
[Message 53] Casey: Perfect!
[Message 54] Dana: Great!
[Message 55] Ethan: Good flexibility.
[Message 56] Alex: I'm free on Saturday afternoons.
[Message 57] Ben: Saturday afternoons work for me too.

[Message 72] Ben: Mentoring can be tough but rewarding.
[Message 73] Casey: Definitely a learning experience for both of you.
[Message 74] Dana: It's great that you're taking on that role, Alex.
[Message 75] Ethan: Good leadership, Alex.
[Message 76] Alex: Thanks, everyone. I'm trying my best. He's eager to learn, but a little shy.
[Message 77] Ben: Just encourage him and give him opportunities to shine.
[Message 78] Casey: Patience is key. Everyone learns at their own pace.
[Message 79] Dana: Make sure he feels comfortable asking questions.
[Message 80] Ethan: Provide constructive feedback.
[Message 81] Alex: Those are all great tips. Thanks! I'll keep them in mind.
[Message 82] Ben: You got this!
[Message 83] Casey: You're a natural leader.
[Message 84] Dana: We believe in you!
[Message 85] Ethan: All good advice.
[Message 86] Alex: I appreciate the support!
[Message 87] Ben: So, back to cars… anyone see that new electric truck from Ford?
[Message 88] Casey: Ooh, I saw a picture of it online. Looks pretty cool!
[Message 89] Dana: Electric trucks are the future!
[Message 90] Ethan: I'm still a gas-powered engine kinda guy.
[Message 91] Alex: I haven't really been following cars lately. But electric is definitely the way things are going.
[Message 92] Ben: It's a beast! Tows like crazy.
[Message 93] Casey: My dad would love that truck. He's a big Ford fan.
[Message 94] Dana: I'm saving up for an electric car. Hopefully in the next few years.
[Message 95] Ethan: Range anxiety is my main concern with electric vehicles.
[Message 96] Alex: Yeah, that's a valid concern, Ethan.
[Message 97] Ben: The range is getting better all the time, though.
[Message 98] Casey: And the charging infrastructure is improving.
[Message 99] Dana: Exactly!
[Message 100] Ethan: Still, needs work.
[Message 101] Alex: True, but progress is being made.
[Message 102] Ben: Alright, alright. Back to volunteering, did you sign us up yet, Alex?

[Message 145] Ethan: I'll be watching. Go Hawks!
[Message 146] Alex: I'm more of a basketball fan, but I might check out the highlights.

[Message 178] Dana: What a thoughtful gesture!
[Message 179] Ethan: Nice touch.

248,"[Message 1] CHLOE: Did you guys hear about what happened at the bank?
[Message 2] MARK: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead.
[Message 3] ANNA: I know! So awful. Who were they?
[Message 4] CHLOE: Someone named David and uh... I think they said Sam.
[Message 5] MARK: David? I think I know a David who works there. Short hair?
[Message 6] ANNA: Oh no! That's terrible!
[Message 7] CHLOE: I heard one of them was a cop.
[Message 8] MARK: A cop?! What the heck happened?
[Message 9] ANNA: No idea. Just saw it on the news. Said something about the police investigating.
[Message 10] CHLOE: I'm supposed to meet Jamie later. Should I cancel?
[Message 11] MARK: Why would you cancel? It's not like you're involved.
[Message 12] ANNA: I agree. Don't let it ruin your plans.
[Message 13] CHLOE: True. Just feels weird, you know? Everyone's on edge.
[Message 14] MARK: Speaking of weird, Jamie’s been acting strange lately, hasn't she?
[Message 15] ANNA: How so?
[Message 16] MARK: Just… distant. And she was asking about… never mind.
[Message 17] CHLOE: Asking about what? Now you have to tell us!
[Message 18] MARK: It’s nothing, really. Just forget I said anything.
[Message 19] ANNA: Mark, come on! Don’t leave us hanging.
[Message 20] CHLOE: Yeah, spill! Is it about David or Sam?
[Message 21] MARK: OKAY, she asked about what kind of security the bank has. Said she was curious.
[Message 22] ANNA: That *is* a bit odd.
[Message 23] CHLOE: Maybe she's planning to rob it? Just kidding!
[Message 24] MARK: Haha, very funny, Chloe.
[Message 25] ANNA: So, Chloe, are you still going to the concert on Friday?
[Message 26] CHLOE: Yeah, definitely. I need something to take my mind off things.
[Message 27] MARK: I could really use one of those right now.
[Message 28] ANNA: Maybe we should all go out for drinks later this week?
[Message 29] CHLOE: I'm in!
[Message 30] MARK: Sounds good. Let me check my schedule.
[Message 31] ANNA: So, anything else weird happening with Jamie, Mark?
[Message 32] MARK: No, not really. Just… on edge too, I guess.
[Message 33] CHLOE: Everyone is on edge.
[Message 34] ANNA: True. But you seemed to imply it was more than that.
[Message 35] MARK: It’s probably just me being paranoid.
[Message 36] CHLOE: Probably. So, movie night this weekend at my place?
[Message 37] MARK: Sure, what are we watching?
[Message 38] ANNA: I'm in too! We should watch that new horror flick.
[Message 39] CHLOE: Deal. I’ll get the snacks.
[Message 40] MARK: I'll bring the drinks!
[Message 41] ANNA: Perfect!
[Message 42] CHLOE: This is a nice distraction. Thanks, guys.
[Message 43] MARK: Anytime, Chloe.
[Message 44] ANNA: Yeah, we're here for you.
[Message 45] CHLOE: So, anyone know any more details about what happened with David?
[Message 46] MARK: Just what's been on the news. Said something about Administering a lethal injection.
[Message 47] ANNA: That's awful! Sounds like something from a movie.
[Message 48] CHLOE: Agreed. So brutal. I wonder if the police are anywhere closer to catching the person who did it?
[Message 49] MARK: I’m sure they're working on it.
[Message 50] ANNA: Hope so. They should lock them up for life.
[Message 51] CHLOE: Agreed. Or worse.
[Message 52] MARK: Easy there, Chloe.
[Message 53] ANNA: Yeah, let’s not get carried away.
[Message 54] CHLOE: Sorry. Just… it’s hard to imagine someone doing that.
[Message 55] MARK: I know.
[Message 56] ANNA: Me too.
[Message 57] CHLOE: Anyway, I'm going to start getting ready. See you guys later?
[Message 58] MARK: Yep, later.
[Message 59] ANNA: Have a good one!
[Message 60] CHLOE: Thanks!
[Message 61] MARK: (Later) Hey Anna, you still up?
[Message 62] ANNA: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 63] MARK: I can't shake this feeling about Jamie. Remember how she was upset when Sam changed her will?
[Message 64] ANNA: A little bit but it was a while ago... She was expecting something?
[Message 65] MARK: I think so. I remember her saying she had ""intended"" to use some of it for her transition, but Sam decided to donate it instead.
[Message 66] ANNA: Wow, I didn't know that.
[Message 67] MARK: Me neither. And I'm starting to piece things together in my head and it makes me nervous.
[Message 68] ANNA: Like what?
[Message 69] MARK: Like maybe Jamie knew something about Sam working late that day.
[Message 70] ANNA: You think she was aware of the crime?
[Message 71] MARK: I dont know...maybe?
[Message 72] ANNA: This is serious, Mark. We can’t just accuse someone without proof.
[Message 73] MARK: I know, I know. I'm just saying, it’s worth considering.
[Message 74] ANNA: Maybe. But let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 75] MARK: Alright. I just needed to tell someone.
[Message 76] ANNA: I understand.
[Message 77] MARK: Thanks, Anna.
[Message 78] ANNA: Anytime. Let’s talk more tomorrow.
[Message 79] MARK: Okay. Good night.
[Message 80] ANNA: Good night.
[Message 81] JAMIE: Hey Chloe, running late. Be there in 30.
[Message 82] CHLOE: No prob. Grab me a water.
[Message 83] JAMIE: Sure thing.
[Message 84] JAMIE: (3 hours later) Hey, I have to crash. Feeling sick.
[Message 85] CHLOE: Everything ok?
[Message 86] JAMIE: Yeah, just a headache.
[Message 87] CHLOE: Get some rest!
[Message 88] JAMIE: Will do. Talk tomorrow.
[Message 89] JAMIE: (Next day) Hey Chloe, can we talk?
[Message 90] CHLOE: Sure, what's up?
[Message 91] JAMIE: Mark’s been acting weird with me.
[Message 92] CHLOE: How so?
[Message 93] JAMIE: Distant, like he's avoiding me.
[Message 94] CHLOE: He's probably just stressed about the David thing.
[Message 95] JAMIE: Maybe. But it feels personal.
[Message 96] CHLOE: I'll talk to him. See what's going on.
[Message 97] JAMIE: Thanks, I appreciate it.
[Message 98] CHLOE: No problem. Friends look out for each other.
[Message 99] JAMIE: So true. Hey, did you hear anything else about the investigation?
[Message 100] CHLOE: Nothing new. Just the same stuff on repeat.
[Message 101] JAMIE: It’s so frustrating. I just want them to catch whoever did this.
[Message 102] CHLOE: Me too. They deserve the maximum penalty.
[Message 103] JAMIE: They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 104] CHLOE: Definitely.
[Message 105] CHLOE: Hey Mark, you free to chat?
[Message 106] MARK: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 107] CHLOE: Jamie says you're acting weird.
[Message 108] MARK: I am?
[Message 109] CHLOE: Yeah, distant and avoidant. Is everything okay?
[Message 110] MARK: It’s nothing. I'm just tired.
[Message 111] CHLOE: Come on, Mark. We're friends. You can tell me.
[Message 112] MARK: Fine. I’m just… worried about her.
[Message 113] CHLOE: Worried? Why?
[Message 114] MARK: I can't say. Just… trust me.
[Message 115] CHLOE: That’s not really helpful, Mark.
[Message 116] MARK: I know, I’m sorry. It’s just… I don’t want to get involved.
[Message 117] CHLOE: Involved in what?
[Message 118] MARK: Nothing! Forget I said anything.
[Message 119] CHLOE: Mark, you're being ridiculous.
[Message 120] MARK: Look, can we just drop it?
[Message 121] CHLOE: Fine. But if something’s going on, you need to tell someone.
[Message 122] MARK: I will. Eventually.
[Message 123] CHLOE: Okay. I'm here if you need me.
[Message 124] MARK: Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 125] MARK: (Later that night) Anna, you awake?
[Message 126] ANNA: Still up. Everything okay?
[Message 127] MARK: I think I messed up.
[Message 128] ANNA: What happened?
[Message 129] MARK: Chloe asked me why I was acting weird with Jamie, and I basically confirmed something was up.
[Message 130] ANNA: Great.
[Message 131] MARK: I know, I know! I panicked. I didn’t want to lie, but I also didn't want to say anything.
[Message 132] ANNA: Well, what did you say exactly?
[Message 133] MARK: I just said I was worried about her, and that I couldn't say why.
[Message 134] ANNA: That’s not good.
[Message 135] MARK: I know! She’s going to think something’s really wrong now.
[Message 136] ANNA: Maybe you should just tell her.
[Message 137] MARK: I can't! What if I'm wrong? I don't want to accuse Jamie of something she didn't do.
[Message 138] ANNA: Okay, okay. Calm down. Let’s think about this.
[Message 139] MARK: I’m so screwed.
[Message 140] ANNA: No, you're not. We’ll figure it out. Maybe you can try to say you were just stressed about work?
[Message 141] MARK: That might work.
[Message 142] ANNA: Try that, and see how she reacts.
[Message 143] MARK: Okay. Thanks, Anna. I owe you one.
[Message 144] ANNA: Just be careful, Mark.
[Message 145] MARK: I will.
[Message 146] JAMIE: Hey Mark
[Message 147] MARK: Hey Jamie.
[Message 148] JAMIE: Chloe said you seem stressed. Is everything alright?
[Message 149] MARK: Yeah, just work stuff. Big deadline coming up.
[Message 150] JAMIE: Oh, okay. Well, let me know if you need anything.
[Message 151] MARK: Thanks, I appreciate it.
[Message 152] JAMIE: No prob. Hey, did the cops say how they found David and Sam?
[Message 153] MARK: Not really. Just said it was fast acting Administering a lethal injection.
[Message 154] JAMIE: That's so scary.

[Message 48] Mark: ""Easy for you to say. They keep implying I had something to do with it. Because I blamed her after she fired me.""

[Message 50] Mark: ""I know, I know. But it's hard to convince them. Especially since they know about our disagreements about the job she was doing.""
[Message 51] Ava: ""They'll figure it out. Someone must have seen something. There's cameras all over the bike path.""
[Message 52] Mark: ""Yeah, hopefully. This is a nightmare. The worst part is I was just trying to protect you. My first thought was you Ava.""

[Message 45] Casey: ""Me too! Can't wait to try that sandwich place.""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Okay, I'm going to head over to the showers and get ready. See you soon!""
[Message 47] Jamie: ""Sounds good! I'll be here soaking up the sun.""
[Message 48] Casey: ""I'll probably do another lap or two around the lazy river.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Enjoy! Talk to you guys in a bit.""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""Later!""
[Message 51] Casey: ""Bye!""
[Message 52] Jamie: ""Hey Casey, did you ever try that new coffee shop on 4th street?""
[Message 53] Casey: ""Oh, the one with the outdoor seating? Yeah, it's pretty good! A little pricey, though.""
[Message 54] Jamie: ""Good to know! I'm always on the lookout for a good cup of coffee.""
[Message 55] Casey: ""Me too! It's essential for a good start to the day.""
[Message 56] Jamie: ""Absolutely! Especially before a camping trip.""
[Message 57] Casey: ""Haha, true! Need all the energy you can get.""
[Message 58] Jamie: ""Yep! Okay, I'm going to go rinse off too. See you in a bit!""
[Message 59] Casey: ""Sounds good! See ya.""
[Message 60] Alex: ""Okay, I'm ready! Just heading to the entrance now.""
[Message 61] Jamie: ""I'm almost there! Just need to grab my towel.""
[Message 62] Casey: ""I'm drying off now. See you both at the entrance in a few minutes.""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Great! See you soon.""
[Message 64] Jamie: ""Sounds good!""
[Message 65] Casey: ""Okay, I'm here! Where are you guys?""
[Message 66] Alex: ""I see you! I'm right by the gate.""
[Message 67] Jamie: ""Just spotted you both! Be there in a sec.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Awesome! Let's head over to that sandwich place.""
[Message 69] Jamie: ""Sounds like a plan!""
[Message 70] Casey: ""Lead the way!""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Alright, let's go! Did you guys see that article about the new art exhibit at the museum?""
[Message 72] Jamie: ""No, I missed that one. What's it about?""
[Message 73] Casey: ""I think it's a collection of local artists' work.""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Yeah, I think so too. I might check it out sometime next week.""
[Message 75] Jamie: ""That sounds interesting! I haven't been to the museum in ages.""
[Message 76] Casey: ""Me neither! Maybe we should make it a group outing.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""That's a great idea! We can go after visiting the bookstore.""
[Message 78] Jamie: ""Perfect! I'm liking this plan more and more.""
[Message 79] Casey: ""Me too! We need to explore more of Reno's cultural scene.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Absolutely! There's so much to do here.""
[Message 81] Jamie: ""Speaking of which, did you hear about the street fair next weekend?""
[Message 82] Casey: ""Oh yeah! I love street fairs. They always have great food and music.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Me too! It's a great way to support local vendors.""
[Message 84] Jamie: ""Definitely! I'm always looking for unique gifts and souvenirs.""
[Message 85] Casey: ""And the people-watching is top-notch!""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Haha, true! Okay, we're almost at the sandwich place. I'm starving!""
[Message 87] Jamie: ""Me too! I can smell the deliciousness already.""
[Message 88] Casey: ""Let's hope the line isn't too long.""
[Message 89] Alex: ""Fingers crossed! If it is, we can always go somewhere else.""
[Message 90] Jamie: ""Good point! Always good to have a backup plan.""
[Message 91] Casey: ""Agreed! Okay, here we are. Let's check it out.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""Okay, the line looks manageable. Let's get in it!""
[Message 93] Jamie: ""Sounds good! What are you guys thinking of getting?""
[Message 94] Casey: ""I'm leaning towards the turkey pesto.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""Ooh, that sounds good. I might try the veggie option.""
[Message 96] Jamie: ""I'm going for the classic Italian. Can't go wrong with that.""
[Message 97] Casey: ""True! Okay, let's decide while we wait.""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Sounds good! Did you see that article about the new recycling program the city is implementing?""
[Message 99] Jamie: ""No, tell me about it!""
[Message 100] Casey: ""I think it's a good thing. We need to be more environmentally conscious.""
[Message 101] Alex: ""Absolutely! It's important to protect our planet for future generations.""
[Message 102] Jamie: ""I agree! I'm always trying to reduce my carbon footprint.""
[Message 103] Casey: ""Me too! Small changes can make a big difference.""
[Message 104] Alex: ""Exactly! Like using reusable bags and water bottles.""
[Message 105] Jamie: ""And composting food scraps!""
[Message 106] Casey: ""Definitely! Okay, we're almost at the front of the line. Time to decide!""
[Message 107] Alex: ""Okay, I'm going with the veggie sandwich.""
[Message 108] Jamie: ""I'm sticking with the Italian.""
[Message 109] Casey: ""Turkey pesto for me!""
[Message 110] Alex: ""Alright! Let's order!""
[Message 111] Jamie: ""Sounds good!""
[Message 112] Casey: ""Okay, all ordered! Now we just wait.""
[Message 113] Alex: ""Perfect! Let's find a table.""
[Message 114] Jamie: ""There's one over there by the window!""
[Message 115] Casey: ""Great! Let's grab it.""
[Message 116] Alex: ""Okay, we're seated! This place looks really nice.""
[Message 117] Jamie: ""It does! And the sandwiches smell amazing.""
[Message 118] Casey: ""I can't wait to try mine.""
[Message 119] Alex: ""Me too! So, what's everyone up to this weekend?""
[Message 120] Jamie: ""Camping, of course! Heading up to Lake Tahoe.""
[Message 121] Casey: ""Sounds amazing! I'm just going to relax and catch up on some reading.""
[Message 122] Alex: ""I'm going to try and volunteer at the community garden.""
[Message 123] Jamie: ""Wow, you're really committed!""
[Message 124] Casey: ""Good for you! It's a great cause.""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Thanks! I'm excited to get involved.""
[Message 126] Jamie: ""Well, have fun! And be sure to tell us all about it next week.""
[Message 127] Casey: ""Yes, please do! I'm curious to hear how it goes.""
[Message 128] Alex: ""I will! Okay, our sandwiches are here!""
[Message 129] Jamie: ""Finally! Let's dig in.""
[Message 130] Casey: ""This looks delicious!""
[Message 131] Alex: ""Mmm, this is so good!""
[Message 132] Jamie: ""Mine's amazing too!""
[Message 133] Casey: ""Definitely worth the wait.""
[Message 134] Alex: ""I agree! This place is a keeper.""
[Message 135] Jamie: ""We should definitely come back here again sometime.""
[Message 136] Casey: ""Absolutely! Maybe next week after the museum?""
[Message 137] Alex: ""Perfect! Sounds like a plan.""
[Message 138] Jamie: ""Okay, I'm officially stuffed.""
[Message 139] Casey: ""Me too! That was a really good sandwich.""
[Message 140] Alex: ""Definitely! I'm glad we came here.""
[Message 141] Jamie: ""Thanks for suggesting it, Alex!""
[Message 142] Casey: ""Yeah, thanks! It was a great choice.""
[Message 143] Alex: ""You're welcome! Always happy to share a good find.""
[Message 144] Jamie: ""Well, I should probably head home and start packing for my camping trip.""
[Message 145] Casey: ""Have a great time! Be safe out there.""
[Message 146] Alex: ""Yeah, have fun! And take lots of pictures.""
[Message 147] Jamie: ""I will! Thanks, guys. See you next week!""
[Message 148] Casey: ""Bye, Jamie! Have a wonderful trip.""
[Message 149] Alex: ""Goodbye, Jamie! See you soon.""
[Message 150] Jamie: ""Later!""
[Message 151] Casey: ""Okay, Alex, what do you want to do now?""
[Message 152] Alex: ""Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe we could walk around downtown for a bit?""
[Message 153] Casey: ""Sounds good to me! I need to walk off this sandwich anyway.""
[Message 154] Alex: ""Me too! Let's go.""
[Message 155] Casey: ""Okay, did you see that article about the local high school winning the state debate championship?""
[Message 156] Alex: ""No way! That's amazing! Reno pride.""
[Message 157] Casey: ""Yeah, it's pretty impressive. Those kids are really smart.""
[Message 158] Alex: ""Definitely! It's good to see young people getting involved in important issues.""
[Message 159] Casey: ""I agree! It gives me hope for the future.""
[Message 160] Alex: ""Me too! So, have you ever been to that antique store on Virginia Street?""
[Message 161] Casey: ""Oh, the one with all the weird stuff? Yeah, I've been there a few times. It's pretty interesting.""
[Message 162] Alex: ""I've always wanted to go. Maybe we could check it out.""
[Message 163] Casey: ""Sure! Why not? It's just around the corner.""
[Message 164] Alex: ""Great! Let's go.""
[Message 165] Casey: ""Okay, here we are. Prepare to be amazed!""
[Message 166] Alex: ""Wow, this place is definitely... unique.""
[Message 167] Casey: ""Told you! You can find some real treasures here if you look hard enough.""
[Message 168] Alex: ""I can see that! I wonder where they get all this stuff.""
[Message 169] Casey: ""Probably estate sales and auctions.""
[Message 170] Alex: ""Makes sense! Look at this old typewriter!""
[Message 171] Casey: ""Wow, that's a blast from the past! My grandma used to have one of those.""
[Message 172] Alex: ""Cool! I've always wanted to try writing on one.""
[Message 173] Casey: ""You should! It's a completely different experience than typing on a computer.""
[Message 174] Alex: ""Maybe I will. I'll keep an eye out. Did you see the news about the new dog park opening?""
[Message 175] Casey: ""Oh that's great news! Maybe I'll take my neighbor's dog there sometime.""
[Message 176] Alex: ""Yeah, that would be nice of you! The neighborhood could really use a dog park.""
[Message 177] Casey: ""True! We are a very dog-friendly city.""
[Message 178] Alex: ""Definitely! I think I might actually buy this typewriter.""
[Message 179] Casey: ""Really? Go for it!""
[Message 180] Alex: ""Okay, I'm going to go ask how much it is.""
[Message 181] Casey: ""Good luck!""
[Message 182] Alex: ""Okay, it's a bit pricey, but I think I'm going to get it.""
[Message 183] Casey: ""Awesome! You can write the next great American novel.""
[Message 184] Alex: ""Haha, maybe! Okay, I'm going to go pay for it. I'll meet you outside.""
[Message 185] Casey: ""Sounds good! I'll be browsing over here.""
[Message 186] Alex: ""Okay, see you in a bit!""
[Message 187] Casey: ""Later!""
[Message 188] Alex: ""Okay, I'm all set! Let's head back.""
[Message 189] Casey: ""Alright! So glad you found something you liked.""
[Message 190] Alex: ""Thanks! I'm excited to start using it.""
[Message 191] Casey: ""Well, I'm going to head home. I need to get some chores done.""
[Message 192] Alex: ""Okay! Thanks for hanging out with me today. I had a great time.""
[Message 193] Casey: ""Me too! It was nice catching up and exploring downtown. See you next week at the bookstore?""

253,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey Bea! Ready to hit some balls?
[Message 2] Bea: Hey Alex! Almost. Just finishing this water. Beautiful evening, isn't it?
[Message 3] Alex: Gorgeous. Perfect temperature too. Makes me think of that outdoor concert series downtown they have in the summer.
[Message 4] Bea: Oh yeah! I love those. They're usually packed, though.
[Message 5] Alex: True. But worth it for some good music under the stars. Speaking of music, have you heard that new band, ""The Mellow Melodies""?
[Message 6] Bea: ""The Mellow Melodies""? Nope, can't say I have. What kind of music do they play?
[Message 7] Alex: Kind of a jazzy, bluesy vibe. Really relaxing.
[Message 8] Bea: Sounds interesting. I'll have to check them out. Maybe while I'm baking tomorrow.
[Message 9] Alex: You bake? What's your specialty?
[Message 10] Bea: Oh, everything! But I really love making sourdough bread. The process is so satisfying.
[Message 11] Alex: Wow, sourdough! That sounds amazing. Okay, ready to play?
[Message 12] Bea: Let's do it! I'm a little rusty, though. Be gentle!
[Message 13] Alex: Haha, no promises!
[Message 14] Bea: So, about that concert series... do you usually go?
[Message 15] Alex: I try to. It's a good way to unwind after work.
[Message 16] Bea: Do they announce the lineup ahead of time?
[Message 17] Alex: Yeah, usually a few weeks before the first concert. I think they post it on the city's website.
[Message 18] Bea: Good to know. I might actually try to go this year. It sounds fun.
[Message 19] Alex: We should go together!
[Message 20] Bea: I'd like that! Maybe a first date thing? 😉
[Message 21] Alex: (blushing emoji) I would absolutely consider it a first date.
[Message 22] Bea: Awesome! Okay, game on!
[Message 23] Alex: What's your stance on using the lines?
[Message 24] Bea: In? Out? I’m feeling generous tonight, call ‘em in!
[Message 25] Alex: My kind of player. Ready when you are.
[Message 26] Bea: *serves ball poorly into the net* Okay, maybe a little *too* rusty.
[Message 27] Alex: Don't worry about it! Happens to the best of us. Maybe we should practice a bit before we actually keep score?
[Message 28] Bea: Good call. Let's just rally for a few minutes.
[Message 29] Alex: Sounds like a plan. Did you see the news about the new exhibit at the Speed Art Museum?
[Message 30] Bea: I did! The one with the contemporary ceramics?
[Message 31] Alex: Yeah, that's the one. I'm thinking of checking it out next week.
[Message 32] Bea: Ooh, I might join you for that! I've always appreciated ceramics.
[Message 33] Alex: Great! It's a date! Well, a non-tennis date anyway.
[Message 34] Bea: Perfect! A pottery date sounds lovely.
[Message 35] Alex: Okay, back to tennis... I'm actually getting warmed up now.
[Message 36] Bea: Me too. I think I'm starting to find my groove.
[Message 37] Alex: Alright, let's see what you've got!
[Message 38] Bea: Prepare to be amazed! (Serves a much better ball this time)
[Message 39] Alex: Wow! Much better! Nice serve.
[Message 40] Bea: Thanks! I'm feeling good. So, the Speed Art Museum... any particular day next week?
[Message 41] Alex: I was thinking Wednesday? Is that good for you?
[Message 42] Bea: Wednesday works perfectly!
[Message 43] Alex: Fantastic! We'll figure out the details later. Focus on the game!
[Message 44] Bea: You're right. Focus. Okay, your serve.
[Message 45] Alex: Alright, here it comes! (Serves the ball)
[Message 46] Bea: And... I miss it! Haha.
[Message 47] Alex: No worries! We're just having fun.
[Message 48] Bea: Exactly! Fun is the key.
[Message 49] Alex: So true. Say, did you ever go to the Kentucky State Fair?
[Message 50] Bea: Oh, when I was a kid! That's a blast from the past. Why?
[Message 51] Alex: Just curious. I haven't been in years, but I always remember the fried food.
[Message 52] Bea: Haha, the fried food is a must! And the farm animals.
[Message 53] Alex: Definitely the farm animals. Maybe we should check it out this year? Another potential date idea.
[Message 54] Bea: You're full of ideas! I like it. Yes, the fair sounds fun!
[Message 55] Alex: Alright! Fair date confirmed... pending our tennis skills improving.
[Message 56] Bea: Haha! Deal.
[Message 57] Alex: Your serve again.
[Message 58] Bea: Okay, concentrating...
[Message 59] Alex: (waits patiently)
[Message 60] Bea: Okay, served!
[Message 61] Alex: Nice shot!
[Message 62] Bea: Thanks! Getting better!
[Message 63] Alex: Definitely! Practice makes perfect. You thinking about making anything fun this weekend baking-wise?
[Message 64] Bea: Hmmm... I was thinking about trying a new recipe for lemon bars.
[Message 65] Alex: Lemon bars sound delicious!
[Message 66] Bea: I'll bring some to the Speed Art Museum on Wednesday.
[Message 67] Alex: Oh, that would be amazing! You're the best.
[Message 68] Bea: Just trying to sweeten the deal.
[Message 69] Alex: (laughs) You definitely are. Okay, my serve.
[Message 70] Bea: Ready!
[Message 71] Alex: (serves the ball with a bit more power)
[Message 72] Bea: Whoa! Nice serve! I almost got it!
[Message 73] Alex: Almost! You're getting close.
[Message 74] Bea: Just need to work on my backhand a little more.
[Message 75] Alex: We can work on that. I'm happy to help.
[Message 76] Bea: Thanks! I appreciate that.
[Message 77] Alex: Anytime. So, back to the concert series... they usually have food trucks there too, right?
[Message 78] Bea: Oh yeah! Tons of them. Everything from pizza to tacos.
[Message 79] Alex: Perfect! We can try all sorts of different things.
[Message 80] Bea: Exactly! Makes it even more fun.
[Message 81] Alex: Agreed. Okay, one more set?
[Message 82] Bea: Sure! Let's do it!
[Message 83] Alex: Alright, my serve.
[Message 84] Bea: Here we go!
[Message 85] Alex: (serves the ball)
[Message 86] Bea: I got it! Nice return!
[Message 87] Alex: Thanks! You too!
[Message 88] Bea: Feeling good!
[Message 89] Alex: Looking good!
[Message 90] Bea: So... the fair... have you ever ridden the Ferris wheel?
[Message 91] Alex: I have! It's kind of scary, but the view is amazing.
[Message 92] Bea: I agree. It's terrifying and exhilarating at the same time.
[Message 93] Alex: We have to ride it. It's a must-do.
[Message 94] Bea: Okay, you've convinced me.
[Message 95] Alex: Awesome! Okay, last few points. Let's make them count!
[Message 96] Bea: You got it! Ready when you are.

[Message 3] Alex: Definitely. I've been going over the proposal. Anything specific you want to prioritize in our discussion?
[Message 4] Jordan: Let's focus on the long-term strategy. I want to make sure we're both on the same page regarding future investments.
[Message 5] Alex: Sounds good. I've got some ideas for that too. Also, have you seen any good movies lately? Need something to unwind with after all this.
[Message 6] Jordan: Haha, good point. I just saw that new Wes Anderson film. Visually stunning, as always.
[Message 7] Alex: Oh, I love his stuff! Definitely adding that to my list. Okay, back to business. I'll prep some slides for tomorrow.
[Message 8] Jordan: Great! I'll do the same. Think we should aim for a 10 AM start?
[Message 9] Alex: Perfect. Gives me time to grab some decent coffee.
[Message 10] Jordan: Agreed. The hotel coffee never cuts it. You staying near downtown?
[Message 11] Alex: Yeah, booked a place on Monroe Center. Seems pretty central.
[Message 12] Jordan: Good choice. Lots of good restaurants around there. Speaking of which, any dietary restrictions I should be aware of for dinner?
[Message 13] Alex: Nope, I'm good with anything. Unless we're talking cilantro… absolutely not.
[Message 14] Jordan: Noted! Haha. No cilantro bombs allowed.
[Message 15] Alex: Excellent. So, 10 AM tomorrow, long-term strategy first. Anything else for tonight?
[Message 16] Jordan: Just get some rest. We have a lot to cover. And maybe enjoy that Wes Anderson film!

[Message 31] Alex: Spotted you! Be right there.
[Message 32] Jordan: Excellent!
[Message 33] Alex: Okay, let's dive in. I brought some visual aids for the strategy discussion.
[Message 34] Jordan: Fantastic. I've got some market analysis data that might be relevant too.
[Message 35] Alex: Awesome. Should we grab some coffee first? My hotel coffee theory was correct... it's awful.
[Message 36] Jordan: Definitely. There's a decent place across the street. Let's do that before we get too deep.
[Message 37] Alex: Sounds like a plan. Lead the way!
[Message 38] Jordan: Alright, this place has good reviews.
[Message 39] Alex: Smells amazing! Okay, caffeinated and ready to conquer the world. Or at least, our business plans.
[Message 40] Jordan: Exactly! So, about those long-term investments... I was thinking we should prioritize R&D in AI.
[Message 41] Alex: I'm inclined to agree. AI is the future. I was also looking at expanding our marketing reach.
[Message 42] Jordan: Good idea. Maybe a targeted social media campaign?
[Message 43] Alex: Precisely. And perhaps some partnerships with relevant influencers.
[Message 44] Jordan: I like where your head's at. We should run some projections on potential ROI for both.
[Message 45] Alex: Agreed. I'll get to work on that this afternoon. You think we should bring in a consultant for the AI strategy?
[Message 46] Jordan: It might be worth considering. I have a few contacts we could reach out to.
[Message 47] Alex: Perfect. Let's put that on the agenda for our next meeting.
[Message 48] Jordan: Sounds good. By the way, did you ever figure out what to do with that old programming code?
[Message 49] Alex: Oh, the legacy system? I think we should just archive it. It's too outdated to be of any use.
[Message 50] Jordan: Agreed. Good riddance. Back to marketing - any thoughts on rebranding?
[Message 51] Alex: That's interesting. I hadn't considered it. What are you thinking?
[Message 52] Jordan: Just throwing it out there. Maybe a slight refresh to appeal to a younger demographic.
[Message 53] Alex: Hmm, could be worth exploring. Let's add that to the research list.

[Message 5] Alex: ""Seriously messed up. Police are saying it was impalement. Sounds horrific.""
[Message 6] Jordan: ""Impalement? Jesus. What is this city coming to? You think they'll catch the guy?""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Hope so. Makes you wonder if you know someone who's capable of that kind of violence.""
[Message 8] Jordan: ""Don't even say that, Alex. I'm already freaked out enough. You seen my keys?""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Nope. Check under the couch? Anyway, heard anything more specific? Like, suspects?""
[Message 10] Jordan: ""Just rumors, you know. Someone said they saw a guy with a limp running away at Dead of Night. But who knows?""
[Message 11] Alex: ""A limp? That's... something. Wonder if that's legit.""
[Message 12] Jordan: ""Could be a red herring. The police need help. I swear, they never do anything.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""True. Anyway, I gotta run. Big meeting at work. Catch you later.""
[Message 14] Jordan: ""Later. Be safe. Seriously.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Always am.""
[Message 16] Jordan: ""Did you talk to River recently?""
[Message 17] Alex: ""River? Not in a while. Why?""
[Message 18] Jordan: ""Just... they seemed off last time I saw them. Said they were having delusions.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Delusions? About what?""
[Message 20] Jordan: ""Didn't say. Just generally stressed about everything. You know River.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Yeah, I do. Hope they're okay. You should check in on them.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""I will. After this whole mess blows over. Too much going on right now.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Fair enough. Let me know if they say anything weird.""
[Message 24] Jordan: ""Will do. You too. Maybe we're both overthinking it.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Probably. Talk soon.""
[Message 26] Jordan: ""Later.""
[Message 27] Chloe: ""Heard about Kai and Riley.""
[Message 28] River: ""Yeah, terrible. I can't believe it.""
[Message 29] Chloe: ""You okay? You seem quiet.""
[Message 30] River: ""Just... processing. It's so messed up. They’re going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 31] Chloe: ""Seriously. Hope they catch whoever did it. Makes you sick.""
[Message 32] River: ""Yeah... sick.""
[Message 33] Chloe: ""Did you know them well?""
[Message 34] River: ""Not really. Just saw them around. Bartended with them a few times at events.""
[Message 35] Chloe: ""Right. Well, let's not dwell on it. Want to grab coffee later?""
[Message 36] River: ""Maybe. I'm kind of wiped. I was looking up how to make Impalement with a sharp object online for a project.""
[Message 37] Chloe: ""Huh? That's a weird project. What for?""
[Message 38] River: ""Just... art. Don't worry about it. Not like I'm going to use it.""
[Message 39] Chloe: ""Okay... just checking. You're acting strange.""
[Message 40] River: ""I'm fine, Chloe. Just tired. And disturbed by what happened, obviously.""
[Message 41] Chloe: ""Of course. Get some rest. I'll talk to you tomorrow.""
[Message 42] River: ""Sounds good. Night.""
[Message 43] Chloe: ""Night.""
[Message 44] Liam: ""Hey, Alex, you free for a quick chat?""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Yeah, what's up?""
[Message 46] Liam: ""It's about the Botanical Garden thing. I saw Mateo leave the building at Dead of Night near there.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Mateo? Seriously? What was he doing around there?""
[Message 48] Liam: ""No idea. He looked really agitated. Just thought you should know.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Agitated how? Did he say anything?""
[Message 50] Liam: ""Didn't see him up close, just from a distance. But he was moving fast, looked stressed.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Okay. Thanks for telling me, Liam. I appreciate it. Did you call it in?""
[Message 52] Liam: ""No, I didn't want to get involved. Just thought you might know what to do with the info.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Right. Got it. Thanks again. Keep me posted if you remember anything else.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Will do. Take care.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""You too.""
[Message 56] Mateo: ""Hey, Chloe, can I ask you something?""
[Message 57] Chloe: ""Sure, what's up?""
[Message 58] Mateo: ""Did I ever tell you about how Kai fired me from The Tipsy Tulip last year? He always hated me.""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""Yeah, you mentioned something about that. Why?""
[Message 60] Mateo: ""He said I wasn't a good fit. BS, right? He was just jealous of my skills.""
[Message 61] Chloe: ""Maybe. But that was a while ago, right? Why bring it up now?""
[Message 62] Mateo: ""Just saying, he wasn't a great guy. Karma's a bitch.""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""Mateo, what are you implying? That you had something to do with what happened to him?""
[Message 64] Mateo: ""No! No way. I would never. Just saying, he wasn't an angel.""
[Message 65] Chloe: ""Okay, good. Because that would be crazy. And I tried to talk him out of it before he took that job.""
[Message 66] Mateo: ""Chill, Chloe. I'm not confessing to anything. Just venting.""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""Right. Venting. Well, maybe vent to someone else about this. It's making me uncomfortable.""
[Message 68] Mateo: ""Fine. Sorry. Just... it's all getting to me, you know?""
[Message 69] Chloe: ""Yeah, I get it. But please, Mateo, don't say things like that.""
[Message 70] Mateo: ""Okay, okay. I won't. Sorry again.""
[Message 71] Chloe: ""Thanks. Talk later.""
[Message 72] Mateo: ""Later.""
[Message 73] Jordan: ""Hey Alex, you still up?""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Yeah, just winding down. What's up?""
[Message 75] Jordan: ""Remember I said River was acting weird?""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Yeah?""
[Message 77] Jordan: ""Well, they just texted me saying they 'got rid of' their 'problem'. Super cryptic.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""WHAT?! You need to call the police NOW.""
[Message 79] Jordan: ""I don't know, Alex, maybe I'm overreacting. Maybe it's something else entirely.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Jordan, two people are dead! You can't take that chance! Call them!""
[Message 81] Jordan: ""Okay, okay, calm down. I'll call them... but what if it's nothing? I don't want to get them in trouble for no reason.""
[Message 82] Alex: ""Better safe than sorry. This is not the time to be hesitant. It is likely that her shouting probably provoked him""
[Message 83] Jordan: ""Fine. Doing it now.""
[Message 84] Alex: ""Let me know what they say. I'm seriously worried.""
[Message 85] Jordan: ""Will do. Cross your fingers.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Fingers crossed. And call the cops immediately if they say anything incriminating. We have to think about what is right.""
[Message 87] Jordan: ""Yeah, I know. I know.""
[Message 88] River: ""Hey Jordan, sorry for the weird text earlier. I just meant I finally finished that awful painting I was working on. It was such a problem.""
[Message 89] Jordan: ""Oh! Oh my god, River, you scared me half to death! I thought...""
[Message 90] River: ""Thought what? What's going on?""
[Message 91] Jordan: ""Never mind. Just... glad you're okay, and that it was just the painting. I'm so sorry I overreacted. This case with Kai and Riley is on my mind a lot""
[Message 92] River: ""No worries. I get it. It's been affecting me too. I know a bartender who worked with them, and he's been saying similar things.""
[Message 93] Jordan: ""Who? Who do you know that worked with them?""
[Message 94] River: ""Mateo. He was always complaining about Kai being the manager. He said he wanted to get rid of him but I didn’t take him serious""
[Message 95] Jordan: ""Mateo, huh? Okay. Thanks, River. I might need to talk to you more about this later.""
[Message 96] River: ""Sure. Anything to help. I'm glad I cleared that up, though.""
[Message 97] Jordan: ""Me too. Huge relief. I am sorry.""
[Message 98] River: ""No worries. Talk soon.""
[Message 99] Jordan: ""Later.""
[Message 100] Alex: ""What did River say?! Are they okay?""
[Message 101] Jordan: ""False alarm! It was about a painting. Huge misunderstanding. My bad.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""A painting?! Seriously? You scared me half to death, Jordan.""
[Message 103] Jordan: ""I know, I know. I'm so sorry. But River mentioned something else...""
[Message 104] Alex: ""What? What did they say?""
[Message 105] Jordan: ""They said Mateo used to work with Kai, and he was always complaining about him, wanted to 'get rid of him'.""
[Message 106] Alex: ""Mateo again? Liam saw him near the Gardens at Dead of Night! We need to tell the police.""
[Message 107] Jordan: ""I know, I know. But what if we're wrong? It's just circumstantial.""
[Message 108] Alex: ""Circumstantial maybe, but it's adding up. We can't ignore it.""
[Message 109] Jordan: ""Fine. I'll call them. But if it's nothing, I'm blaming you.""
[Message 110] Alex: ""Deal. Just make the call, Jordan.""
[Message 111] Jordan: ""Dialing now...""
[Message 112] Alex: ""Good. Let me know what happens.""
[Message 113] Jordan: ""Will do. This is stressful.""
[Message 114] Alex: ""Tell me about it. Stay strong. We're doing the right thing.""
[Message 115] Jordan: ""Hope so. Hope so.""
[Message 116] Liam: ""Hey Alex, just remembered something else about Mateo.""
[Message 117] Alex: ""What is it, Liam?""
[Message 118] Liam: ""He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""
[Message 119] Alex: ""Hurting who?! Be specific, Liam!""
[Message 120] Liam: ""Riley. He said she was a terrible bartender and deserved what was coming to her.""
[Message 121] Alex: ""Oh my god. Liam, why didn't you say this before?!""
[Message 122] Liam: ""I was scared, okay? I didn't want to get involved. But after hearing about River's painting, I knew I had to say something.""
[Message 123] Alex: ""You need to tell this to the police, Liam. This is crucial.""
[Message 124] Liam: ""I will. I promise. I'm calling them right now.""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Good. Thank you, Liam. You're doing the right thing.""
[Message 126] Liam: ""I hope so. I feel terrible that I didn't say anything sooner.""
[Message 127] Alex: ""Don't beat yourself up. Just focus on helping them catch the person responsible.""
[Message 128] Liam: ""Okay. Talk soon.""
[Message 129] Alex: ""Later.""
[Message 130] Jordan: ""The police are on their way to Mateo's. They said thanks for the tip.""
[Message 131] Alex: ""Finally. Took them long enough. Hope they find something.""
[Message 132] Jordan: ""Me too. This whole thing has been a nightmare.""
[Message 133] Alex: ""Tell me about it. Glad it's (hopefully) coming to an end.""
[Message 134] Jordan: ""Yeah. Let's grab a drink when this is all over. We deserve it.""
[Message 135] Alex: ""Definitely. First round's on me.""
[Message 136] Jordan: ""Deal. Thanks, Alex. For everything.""
[Message 137] Alex: ""Anytime, Jordan. We're in this together.""
[Message 138] Jordan: ""Couldn't ask for a better friend.""
[Message 139] Alex: ""Same here. Now, let's just hope they catch Mateo.""
[Message 140] Jordan: ""Fingers crossed.""
[Message 141] Alex: ""I'm going to make a sandwich.""
[Message 142] Jordan: ""Good idea. I'm starving. I failed to call 911 after the victim was hurt.""
[Message 143] Alex: ""Me too. Stress eating is real.""
[Message 144] Jordan: ""It is. Let's just hope justice is served. Hope they don't get the death penalty, though. That's too harsh.""

[Message 31] Alex: Just doing my civic duty to ensure caffeine access at festivals!
[Message 32] Jamie: Speaking of duties, anyone else dreading teacher-student conferences?
[Message 33] Jordan: Oh, don't even get me started on those.
[Message 34] Riley: I always feel so awkward at them.
[Message 35] Casey: Ugh, me too.
[Message 36] Alex: My grandkids’ conferences are next week. Always an adventure.
[Message 37] Jamie: What grade are they in, Alex?
[Message 38] Jordan: I remember feeling so nervous before those when I was a kid.
[Message 39] Riley: Me too, Jordan! I always thought I was in trouble, even if I wasn't.
[Message 40] Casey: Same!
[Message 41] Alex: One is in 3rd grade, the other in 7th.
[Message 42] Jamie: 7th grade is tough! Middle school years...
[Message 43] Jordan: Middle school is a whole different beast.
[Message 44] Riley: Agreed. So many emotions.
[Message 45] Casey: So. Many. Emotions.
[Message 46] Alex: Exactly! Trying to navigate that with them is...interesting.
[Message 47] Jamie: Any tips for surviving teacher-student conferences, Alex?
[Message 48] Jordan: Good question, Jamie.
[Message 49] Riley: I could use some tips too.
[Message 50] Casey: Ditto.
[Message 51] Alex: Go in with an open mind, and remember the teachers are on your side!
[Message 52] Jamie: That's a good reminder. Thanks, Alex.
[Message 53] Jordan: A positive attitude is key.
[Message 54] Riley: I’ll try to remember that.
[Message 55] Casey: I'll try to be less anxious this time.
[Message 56] Alex: And don’t be afraid to ask questions!
[Message 57] Jamie: Definitely.
[Message 58] Jordan: Important.
[Message 59] Riley: Good point.
[Message 60] Casey: Will do!
[Message 61] Alex: Okay, back to festivals! Anyone interested in a Renaissance Faire?
[Message 62] Jamie: Ooh, Renaissance Faire! Those are fun.
[Message 63] Jordan: Renaissance Faire... hmm. Not usually my thing.
[Message 64] Riley: I’ve never been to one. What's it like?
[Message 65] Casey: Lots of costumes, jousting, and turkey legs!
[Message 66] Alex: Exactly, Casey! And crafts, and music...
[Message 67] Jamie: It's a whole experience!
[Message 68] Jordan: Jousting, you say? Maybe it's worth a look.
[Message 69] Riley: Jousting does sound kind of cool.
[Message 70] Casey: It's pretty entertaining!
[Message 71] Alex: There's one in Irwindale coming up in April.
[Message 72] Jamie: April is a bit far off, but I'll keep it in mind.
[Message 73] Jordan: April...gives me time to prepare my witty medieval insults.
[Message 74] Riley: Prepare your what now, Jordan?
[Message 75] Casey: LOL, Jordan!
[Message 76] Alex: Haha! You’ll fit right in, Jordan.
[Message 77] Jamie: Jordan, you crack me up.
[Message 78] Jordan: Someone has to keep things interesting.
[Message 79] Riley: True that.
[Message 80] Casey: Agreed!
[Message 81] Alex: So, tentative interest in the Renaissance Faire?
[Message 82] Jamie: Tentative yes from me!
[Message 83] Jordan: I'll consider it. Depends on the availability of mead.
[Message 84] Riley: I’m leaning towards yes.
[Message 85] Casey: I'm in!
[Message 86] Alex: Excellent! I'll add it to the list.
[Message 87] Jamie: What else is on the list, Alex?
[Message 88] Jordan: Yes, do tell!
[Message 89] Riley: I'm curious too!
[Message 90] Casey: Spill the beans!
[Message 91] Alex: Foodie Fest in Huntington Beach, Art Festival downtown, potentially Renaissance Faire...
[Message 92] Jamie: That's a good start!
[Message 93] Jordan: A solid foundation.
[Message 94] Riley: Not bad at all.
[Message 95] Casey: Sounds like a fun summer!
[Message 96] Alex: Exactly! And we're just getting started.
[Message 97] Jamie: Any music festivals catching your eye?
[Message 98] Jordan: Now you're talking my language, Jamie.
[Message 99] Riley: Music is always a good idea.
[Message 100] Casey: Absolutely!
[Message 101] Alex: I haven't looked into music festivals specifically yet, but I will!
[Message 102] Jamie: Awesome!
[Message 103] Jordan: Let me know what you find.
[Message 104] Riley: Please do!
[Message 105] Casey: Yes, please!
[Message 106] Alex: Will do! Anyone have any music festival preferences? Genre-wise?
[Message 107] Jamie: I'm pretty open to anything.
[Message 108] Jordan: I lean towards indie and alternative.
[Message 109] Riley: I like a good mix of genres.
[Message 110] Casey: Me too!
[Message 111] Alex: Okay, good to know! I’ll keep that in mind when I search.
[Message 112] Jamie: This is getting me excited for summer!
[Message 113] Jordan: Me too!
[Message 114] Riley: I’m looking forward to it.
[Message 115] Casey: Same here!
[Message 116] Alex: Me too! And mini golf is a good start!
[Message 117] Jamie: Definitely!
[Message 118] Jordan: A fine prelude to summer festivities.
[Message 119] Riley: Indeed.
[Message 120] Casey: Agreed!
[Message 121] Alex: Speaking of, my turn is up!
[Message 122] Jamie: Go for it!
[Message 123] Jordan: Good luck!
[Message 124] Riley: Aim for the windmill!
[Message 125] Casey: You got this!
[Message 126] Alex: Okay, here we go...
[Message 127] Jamie: How did it go?
[Message 128] Jordan: Inquiring minds want to know!
[Message 129] Riley: Did you make it through the windmill?
[Message 130] Casey: Tell us everything!
[Message 131] Alex: I got it in two! Not bad, if I do say so myself.
[Message 132] Jamie: Nice!
[Message 133] Jordan: Well done!
[Message 134] Riley: Impressive!
[Message 135] Casey: Awesome!
[Message 136] Alex: Thanks, everyone! It’s Jamie’s turn now.
[Message 137] Jamie: Alright, wish me luck!
[Message 138] Jordan: Good luck, Jamie!
[Message 139] Riley: You got this!
[Message 140] Casey: Go Jamie!
[Message 141] Alex: And after this, maybe we should all decide on a festival for sure!
[Message 142] Jamie: Sounds like a plan, Alex!
[Message 143] Jordan: Agreed. Let's narrow it down.
[Message 144] Riley: Definitely.
[Message 145] Casey: Yes!
[Message 146] Alex: Okay, so Foodie Fest, Art Festival, Renaissance Faire, and music festivals...
[Message 147] Jamie: Let's start with what everyone is *most* excited about.
[Message 148] Jordan: A democratic approach. I approve.
[Message 149] Riley: Fair enough.
[Message 150] Casey: Sounds good to me!
[Message 151] Alex: Okay, so, everyone vote for their top choice!
[Message 152] Jamie: Art Festival for me!
[Message 153] Jordan: Foodie Fest. I'm hungry.
[Message 154] Riley: Renaissance Faire!
[Message 155] Casey: Music festival!
[Message 156] Alex: I'm torn between the Foodie Fest and the Art Festival...
[Message 157] Jamie: Close call!
[Message 158] Jordan: Decisive moment!
[Message 159] Riley: What will it be, Alex?
[Message 160] Casey: The suspense is killing me!
[Message 161] Alex: Okay, okay... I'm going to have to go with the Art Festival.
[Message 162] Jamie: Art Festival wins!
[Message 163] Jordan: So, Art Festival it is!
[Message 164] Riley: Sounds good!
[Message 165] Casey: Awesome!
[Message 166] Alex: Art Festival it is! July 15th-17th!
[Message 167] Jamie: Excellent!
[Message 168] Jordan: Marked on the calendar.
[Message 169] Riley: I'm in!
[Message 170] Casey: Me too!
[Message 171] Alex: Great! Can’t wait to see you all there!
[Message 172] Jamie: Same here!
[Message 173] Jordan: Looking forward to it.
[Message 174] Riley: Me too!
[Message 175] Casey: Can't wait!
[Message 176] Alex: Okay, back to mini golf!
[Message 177] Jamie: Good idea!
[Message 178] Jordan: Indeed.
[Message 179] Riley: Let's finish strong!
[Message 180] Casey: Agreed!
[Message 181] Alex: Who’s up next?
[Message 182] Jamie: I think it’s Jordan’s turn.
[Message 183] Jordan: My turn to conquer the mini golf course.
[Message 184] Riley: Show us what you've got, Jordan!
[Message 185] Casey: You got this!
[Message 186] Alex: Good luck, Jordan!
[Message 187] Jamie: Good luck!
[Message 188] Jordan: Alright, here goes nothing!
[Message 189] Riley: We're all rooting for you!

[Message 44] Chris: ""Hitchcock, huh? I'm more of an action movie guy.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""I enjoy a good action flick too, but Hitchcock's suspense is unmatched.""
[Message 46] Ben: ""Exactly! The way he builds tension is masterful. And the performances are always top-notch.""

[Message 50] Chris: ""1:30 PM works for me.""

[Message 8] River: Nah, I'm good, Alex. They're... rustic. Adds character. Besides, I'm practicing my stand-up routine tonight.

[Message 30] River: Mostly the trials and tribulations of being a genderfluid person navigating the world.
[Message 31] Jamie: That sounds really interesting!
[Message 32] River: I hope so! I'm trying to make it relatable, even if people haven't had the same experiences.
[Message 33] Jamie: I'm sure you will. You're naturally funny.
[Message 34] River: Thanks, Jamie! That means a lot.
[Message 35] Jamie: No problem! Just speaking the truth.
[Message 36] River: Gotta run! Gotta polish my routine! Talk to you tomorrow!
[Message 37] Jamie: Sounds good! See you then!
[Message 38] Alex: Hey guys, back! Apples acquired! So, Jamie, you’re a construction worker, right? Have any funny stories from the job site?
[Message 39] Jamie: Oh man, tons. One time, this guy was trying to explain to the foreman how he’d accidentally glued his hard hat to his head…
[Message 40] Alex: No way!
[Message 41] Jamie: I swear! We had to call the fire department.
[Message 42] Alex: Oh my god, that’s amazing. I can just picture it.
[Message 43] Jamie: It was a sight to behold. The foreman was trying so hard not to laugh.
[Message 44] Alex: I would have lost it. So, you watch sports, right? Any particularly hilarious moments you’ve seen recently?
[Message 45] Jamie: Let me think… Well, there was that time the mascot tripped over his own feet during the halftime show…
[Message 46] Alex: Classic! Mascots are inherently funny.
[Message 47] Jamie: They are! The poor guy just face-planted. The crowd went wild.
[Message 48] Alex: I love that. Okay, pie crust time! Wish me luck!
[Message 49] Jamie: Good luck! Don’t burn it!
[Message 50] Alex: I'll try my best! Haha!
[Message 51] Jamie: So, how old are your grandkids, Alex? I know you mentioned them baking with you before.
[Message 52] Alex: Oh, let's see... I have 5! One is 18, twins who are 10, and then a 7-year-old and a 4-year-old.
[Message 53] Jamie: Wow, that's quite the range!
[Message 54] Alex: Tell me about it! It keeps life interesting.
[Message 55] Jamie: I bet! My oldest is... well, let's just say they're closer to your age than mine, haha.
[Message 56] Alex: Haha! Life comes at you fast, doesn't it?
[Message 57] Jamie: It sure does. Gotta appreciate the little things. Like a well-made apple pie.
[Message 58] Alex: Exactly! Speaking of which, the crust is looking good!
[Message 59] Jamie: Awesome! Keep me updated!
[Message 60] Alex: Will do! Gotta go knead the dough some more.
[Message 61] Jamie: Alright! Talk soon!
[Message 62] River: Hey guys, pie crust sounds amazing, Alex! I'm trying to write a joke about a sentient toaster... Any ideas?
[Message 63] Alex: Ooh, a sentient toaster! That's a great premise! Maybe it's judgmental about the type of bread you use?
[Message 64] Jamie: Or maybe it only toasts things to the exact shade of brown it prefers.
[Message 65] River: Yes! I love that! A perfectionist toaster!
[Message 66] Alex: It could have a complex about being replaced by newer, fancier toasters.
[Message 67] River: Omg, a toaster identity crisis! You guys are amazing!
[Message 68] Jamie: We aim to please. Or at least amuse.
[Message 69] Alex: Definitely amusing! I'm picturing a tiny therapist couch for the toaster.
[Message 70] River: Hahaha! That's gold! Okay, gotta write this down! Thanks, team!
[Message 71] Jamie: No problem! Glad we could help!
[Message 72] Alex: Anytime! Hope your stand-up goes well!
[Message 73] River: Me too! My mom is coming, so the pressure is on.
[Message 74] Jamie: Oh, moms are the toughest critics.
[Message 75] Alex: True that! But also the biggest supporters.
[Message 76] River: That's true! She's always been in my corner.
[Message 77] Jamie: That's awesome! Well, good luck!
[Message 78] River: Thanks again! Bye for now!
[Message 79] Alex: Bye! And Jamie, thanks again for the tablecloth!
[Message 80] Jamie: Anytime, Alex! Glad to help!
[Message 81] Alex: The pie is in the oven! Now the waiting game begins.
[Message 82] Jamie: Patience is a virtue, Alex. (Especially when baking.)
[Message 83] Alex: You're right, you're right. Time to find something to distract myself.
[Message 84] Jamie: Any good books you've been meaning to read?
[Message 85] Alex: Oh, I have a whole stack! Maybe I'll finally start that mystery novel everyone's been talking about.
[Message 86] Jamie: Sounds like a plan! A little suspense to pass the time.
[Message 87] Alex: Exactly! Or maybe I'll just binge-watch some silly sitcoms.
[Message 88] Jamie: That works too! Whatever gets you through the waiting.
[Message 89] Alex: True! Okay, wish me luck that the pie doesn't burn!
[Message 90] Jamie: You got this! Just keep an eye on it!
[Message 91] Alex: Will do! Thanks for the encouragement!
[Message 92] Jamie: No problem! Happy to help!
[Message 93] Alex: So, what are you up to tonight, Jamie?
[Message 94] Jamie: Just relaxing! Maybe watch some baseball.
[Message 95] Alex: Sounds perfect! A nice, chill evening.
[Message 96] Jamie: Exactly! Gotta recharge before the bake sale tomorrow.
[Message 97] Alex: Definitely! It's going to be a busy day.
[Message 98] Jamie: Yep! But for a good cause, right?
[Message 99] Alex: Absolutely! That's what makes it all worthwhile.
[Message 100] Jamie: Agreed!
[Message 101] Alex: Just checked the pie! Looking golden brown!
[Message 102] Jamie: Yay! Almost there!
[Message 103] Alex: I can almost smell it too!
[Message 104] Jamie: That's the best part!
[Message 105] Alex: Definitely! Okay, back to my book!
[Message 106] Jamie: Enjoy!
[Message 107] Alex: You too! Have fun watching baseball!
[Message 108] Jamie: Will do! Talk soon!
[Message 109] Alex: Later!
[Message 110] River: Hey! Back from stand-up practice! My toaster joke needs work. Any other angles?
[Message 111] Alex: Hmm, maybe the toaster is obsessed with conspiracy theories? Like, it thinks the government is controlling the bread companies.
[Message 112] Jamie: Or maybe it has a secret love affair with a microwave.
[Message 113] River: A toaster-microwave romance! I love it! The forbidden love!
[Message 114] Alex: Exactly! Think Romeo and Juliet, but with kitchen appliances.
[Message 115] Jamie: That's brilliant! The families are divided by cooking methods.
[Message 116] River: This is gold! I'm writing this down immediately!
[Message 117] Alex: Glad we could help!
[Message 118] Jamie: We're just a couple of idea factories.
[Message 119] River: You guys are the best! Seriously!
[Message 120] Alex: We try! So, how did the rest of your set go?
[Message 121] River: Pretty well, actually! The self-checkout joke killed!
[Message 122] Jamie: I knew it would! Everyone can relate.
[Message 123] Alex: See? Universal humor!
[Message 124] River: Definitely! I even got a few laughs with my bit about mismatched socks.
[Message 125] Jamie: Mismatched socks are a serious problem!
[Message 126] Alex: A societal crisis, even!
[Message 127] River: Exactly! I think people appreciate the relatable stuff.
[Message 128] Jamie: Agreed! Keep it real!
[Message 129] Alex: Pie's out of the oven! Success!
[Message 130] River: Yay! Pie party tomorrow!
[Message 131] Jamie: Can't wait! I'm bringing extra napkins!
[Message 132] Alex: Good thinking! Things could get messy!
[Message 133] River: Messy is good! It means people are enjoying themselves!
[Message 134] Jamie: True!
[Message 135] Alex: Okay, I'm going to let the pie cool down. Then, sleep!
[Message 136] River: Sounds like a plan! Get some rest!
[Message 137] Jamie: Definitely! See you both tomorrow!
[Message 138] Alex: Goodnight!
[Message 139] River: Night!
[Message 140] Jamie: Goodnight everyone!
[Message 141] Alex: Morning everyone! Ready for the bake sale?
[Message 142] Jamie: Morning! Coffee in hand, tablecloth in tow. Ready to go!
[Message 143] River: Morning! Armed with my (slightly burnt) cookies and my (hopefully) hilarious jokes!
[Message 144] Alex: Perfect! Let's do this!
[Message 145] Jamie: Let's raise some money for charity!
[Message 146] River: And spread some laughter while we're at it!
[Message 147] Alex: Exactly! Meet you guys at the College Quad?
[Message 148] Jamie: Sounds good! See you there in about an hour!
[Message 149] River: Same here! I need to find my apron first...
[Message 150] Alex: Haha! Aprons are essential!
[Message 151] Jamie: Definitely! Keeps the flour off your clothes!
[Message 152] River: True! Okay, gotta run! See you soon!
[Message 153] Alex: Later!
[Message 154] Jamie: Bye!
[Message 155] Alex: Just arrived at the Quad. Setting up!
[Message 156] Jamie: On my way! Should be there in 10!
[Message 157] Alex: Great!
[Message 158] Jamie: The weather is gorgeous! Perfect for a bake sale.
[Message 159] Alex: I know! Couldn't have asked for a better day.
[Message 160] Jamie: Nope! So excited to see everyone!
[Message 161] Alex: Me too! And to see all the delicious treats!
[Message 162] Jamie: Oh yeah! I'm already hungry!
[Message 163] Alex: Me too! Especially for those lemon bars!
[Message 164] Jamie: Haha! I'll save you one!
[Message 165] Alex: You're the best! See you soon!
[Message 166] Jamie: See ya!
[Message 167] River: Running late! Traffic is a nightmare! So sorry!
[Message 168] Alex: No worries, River! We're just setting up. Plenty of time!
[Message 169] Jamie: Yeah, no rush! Just drive safe!
[Message 170] River: Thanks, guys! Appreciate it! I'll be there as soon as I can!
[Message 171] Alex: We'll be here! Saving you a spot!
[Message 172] Jamie: Yep! And maybe a cookie or two!
[Message 173] River: You guys are the best! Seriously!
[Message 174] Alex: We know! Haha!
[Message 175] Jamie: Just trying to be helpful! And hungry!
[Message 176] River: I'll bring extra cookies to make up for it!
[Message 177] Alex: Awesome! That's the spirit!
[Message 178] Jamie: Perfect! See you soon, River!
[Message 179] River: See you! Almost there!
[Message 180] Alex: Great! We're almost ready to go!
[Message 181] Jamie: Awesome! Can't wait to get started!
[Message 182] Alex: Me neither! This is going to be great!
[Message 183] Jamie: Definitely!

266,"[Message 1] CHLOE: Did you guys hear about what happened at the Concert Venue? So awful.
[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, crazy. Right at Noon too. I was grabbing a coffee down the street.
[Message 3] AVERY: I can't believe it. Poor Jordan. They were so creative.
[Message 4] CHLOE: Jordan? I didn't even know their name.
[Message 5] LIAM: It's all over the news. Something about impalement? Sick.
[Message 6] AVERY: Yeah, with a Impalement with a sharp object. Brutal.
[Message 7] CHLOE: I was with Kai at the time. We were thrifting.
[Message 8] KAI: That's right. Chloe needed a new fit.
[Message 9] LIAM: Kai, weren't you working a shift at that venue last week?
[Message 10] KAI: Yeah, just security. Why?
[Message 11] AVERY: Just seems like bad luck. I feel terrible for the manager.
[Message 12] CHLOE: True. What if this affects the venue? I have tickets for next month!
[Message 13] KAI: Guys, stop. Someone lost their life. Let's be respectful.
[Message 14] LIAM: Sorry, Kai. It's just…shocking. Did anyone know Jordan?
[Message 15] AVERY: I knew them. They were… complicated. Had some beef with Alex.
[Message 16] CHLOE: Alex? Who's that?
[Message 17] AVERY: Just someone who used to work there. Nothing important.
[Message 18] KAI: Avery, don't start rumors. It's too soon.
[Message 19] LIAM: But you're saying Alex and Jordan didn’t get along? What was that about?
[Message 20] AVERY: I don’t know exactly, but Alex always hated Jordan. Maybe something about Alex’s termination.
[Message 21] CHLOE: Guys, can we change the subject? This is stressing me out.
[Message 22] LIAM: Sure. Kai, you still training for that marathon?
[Message 23] KAI: Trying to. It's hard to find the time. I was going to buy Impalement with a sharp object at the store.
[Message 24] AVERY: By the way Liam, didnt you say you saw someone leaving the Concert Venue at Noon?
[Message 25] LIAM: Yeah, I think so...It was Alex, wasn’t it?
[Message 26] CHLOE: Nooo. You guys are awful.
[Message 27] KAI: Liam, are you sure it was Alex? Noon is pretty specific.
[Message 28] LIAM: Pretty sure. They were walking really fast, looked like they were trying to get away.
[Message 29] AVERY: Hmm. That seems pretty damning, considering Alex’s potential mens rea.
[Message 30] CHLOE: You and your crazy theories.
[Message 31] KAI: Avery, stop trying to be a detective.
[Message 32] AVERY: I'm just saying, if Alex intended to do it because of the job loss, that looks bad.
[Message 33] LIAM: I didn’t see anything. Just saw Alex nearby. Could be a coincidence.
[Message 34] CHLOE: Exactly, Liam saw nothing. Case closed.
[Message 35] KAI: Guys, I gotta go. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 36] AVERY: Agreed. Justice for Jordan. It sounds like Alex purposefully created the situation.
[Message 37] CHLOE: I am not talking about this anymore!
[Message 38] LIAM: Look, all I know is Jordan was a Corrections Officer and this is horrible. The police will figure it out.

267,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone! Mini golf's fun so far. Anyone got any crafting plans for the weekend?
[Message 2] Jamie: Hey Alex! It is a blast. Crafting… I was thinking of trying to make some beeswax wraps. Seems eco-friendly.
[Message 3] River: Beeswax wraps! Nice, Jamie! I've been wanting to try those too. I might try to make some bath bombs this weekend.
[Message 4] Sam: Bath bombs sound relaxing, River. I'm boring – probably just reorganizing my yarn stash.
[Message 5] Jordan: Reorganizing yarn is an art, Sam! I respect that. I’m just thinking about the family dinner tomorrow. What’s everyone bringing?
[Message 6] Alex: Family dinner tomorrow! Totally forgot. I’m not sure what to bring. Crafting plans might need to take a backseat.
[Message 7] Jamie: Alex, you could bring a dessert! A simple pie, maybe?
[Message 8] River: Pie is always a winner. I’m bringing a salad, something light.
[Message 9] Sam: I can bring a casserole. Easy and always a hit.
[Message 10] Jordan: Casserole sounds great, Sam! I'll handle the main course – probably something grilled.
[Message 11] Alex: Okay, dessert it is! Maybe I’ll try a fruit crumble.
[Message 12] Jamie: Fruit crumble sounds delicious, Alex! Back to crafting, though, anyone ever tried making their own paper?
[Message 13] River: Making paper! That sounds intense. I’ve seen it done but never tried it myself.
[Message 14] Sam: I’ve seen kits for making paper, but it seems like a lot of effort. Kudos to you if you try it, Jamie!
[Message 15] Jordan: Yeah, paper making sounds like a whole project. I admire your ambition, Jamie.
[Message 16] Alex: Seriously! That's commitment. I’m impressed.
[Message 17] Jamie: Just brainstorming! Might stick to the beeswax wraps. Less messy, probably.
[Message 18] River: Smart move. Speaking of less messy, anyone have any tips for glitter control when crafting? It gets EVERYWHERE.
[Message 19] Sam: Oh god, glitter. The bane of my existence. My tip is: don’t use it.
[Message 20] Jordan: Sam speaks the truth! Avoid glitter at all costs.
[Message 21] Alex: I agree with Sam and Jordan. Glitter is evil.
[Message 22] Jamie: Haha, noted! No glitter. What about crafting with kids? Any survival tips?
[Message 23] River: Patience! Lots and lots of patience. And washable everything.
[Message 24] Sam: River is right. Washable everything is key. And lower your expectations.
[Message 25] Jordan: Lowering expectations is crucial! And have plenty of snacks on hand.
[Message 26] Alex: Snacks are a great idea! Bribe them with snacks.
[Message 27] Jamie: Noted! Patience, washable everything, low expectations, and snacks. Thanks, everyone!
[Message 28] River: You got this, Jamie! By the way, did anyone see that article about the local art fair?
[Message 29] Sam: No, I missed that. What art fair?
[Message 30] Jordan: I think I saw something about it. It's in Hialeah, right?
[Message 31] Alex: I haven't heard anything. Where is it going to be?
[Message 32] Jamie: Ooh, I want to know too! Where is it, River?
[Message 33] River: It's at Milander Park next weekend. Supposedly lots of local artists.
[Message 34] Sam: Milander Park, okay! I might check that out. Thanks, River.
[Message 35] Jordan: Sounds interesting. I might go too, if I have time.
[Message 36] Alex: I’ll see if I can make it. Thanks for the heads up, River.
[Message 37] Jamie: Me too! Sounds like fun. Back to family dinner – anyone bringing drinks?
[Message 38] River: I can grab some sparkling cider. Festive and non-alcoholic.
[Message 39] Sam: Sparkling cider sounds perfect!
[Message 40] Jordan: Great idea, River! I can get some iced tea.
[Message 41] Alex: Iced tea sounds good! I’m all set with the dessert, so I’m covered.
[Message 42] Jamie: Perfect! We’re all set for dinner then. Now, about those beeswax wraps… what kind of patterns should I use?
[Message 43] River: Cute fabric scraps! Something bright and cheerful.
[Message 44] Sam: Yeah, fun patterns! Maybe something floral or geometric.
[Message 45] Jordan: I agree. Bright colors and interesting patterns will make them look great.
[Message 46] Alex: Definitely something colorful!
[Message 47] Jamie: Okay, colorful and fun it is! I have some old fabric scraps lying around.
[Message 48] River: Perfect! Upcycling at its finest.
[Message 49] Sam: Exactly! Good for the environment and your crafting stash.
[Message 50] Jordan: Double win!
[Message 51] Alex: Love it! Reduce, reuse, recycle…and craft!
[Message 52] Jamie: Haha, you got it! Anyone else feel like they have too many crafting supplies?
[Message 53] River: Absolutely! It's a never-ending cycle of buying more supplies even though I have enough to last a lifetime.
[Message 54] Sam: Story of my life! I keep telling myself I need more yarn…
[Message 55] Jordan: I have a whole room dedicated to crafting supplies. It's slightly embarrassing.
[Message 56] Alex: Don’t be embarrassed! Embrace the craft room!
[Message 57] Jamie: I’m getting there! I’m slowly taking over the spare bedroom.
[Message 58] River: That’s the spirit! Claim your territory!
[Message 59] Sam: Crafting empires are built one supply at a time.
[Message 60] Jordan: True that! So, anyone tried making candles?
[Message 61] Alex: I've tried candle making! It's fun, but a bit tricky to get the scent right.
[Message 62] Jamie: Candle making is on my list! Any tips, Alex?
[Message 63] River: I’ve always wanted to try candle making too!
[Message 64] Sam: Candles are nice. I mostly just buy them though.
[Message 65] Jordan: Me too, Sam. I appreciate the effort, but I lack the patience.
[Message 66] Alex: Use good quality wax and essential oils, Jamie! And be careful with the temperature.
[Message 67] Jamie: Thanks for the tips, Alex! I’ll keep that in mind.
[Message 68] River: What scents do you like to use, Alex?
[Message 69] Sam: Lavender is always a good choice for candles, in my opinion.
[Message 70] Jordan: I like citrusy scents.
[Message 71] Alex: I like to experiment! Lavender, citrus, and even some woodsy scents.
[Message 72] Jamie: Okay, lots of options! I’ll do some research.
[Message 73] River: Research is key! There are tons of tutorials online.
[Message 74] Sam: YouTube is your friend!
[Message 75] Jordan: Definitely! You can learn anything on YouTube.
[Message 76] Alex: True! YouTube is a crafting lifesaver.
[Message 77] Jamie: I agree! YouTube is amazing.
[Message 78] River: Speaking of amazing, anyone watching that new baking show?
[Message 79] Sam: Oh, which one? There are so many!
[Message 80] Jordan: I think I know which one you mean! The one with the crazy cake designs?
[Message 81] Alex: I haven't seen it. What's it called?
[Message 82] Jamie: I haven't either! Tell us more, River!
[Message 83] River: It's called ""Crazy Cakes"" or something like that. It's on Netflix.
[Message 84] Sam: Oh yeah! I've seen ads for that. Looks wild.
[Message 85] Jordan: The cakes are insane! So creative.
[Message 86] Alex: I’ll have to check it out. Sounds entertaining.
[Message 87] Jamie: Me too! Netflix binge-watching session coming up.
[Message 88] River: Let me know what you think!
[Message 89] Sam: Will do! Okay, back to crafting... anyone ever tried dyeing fabric with natural dyes?
[Message 90] Jordan: That sounds really interesting, Sam! I've heard of it but never tried it.
[Message 91] Alex: Natural dyes! That’s cool. What kind of plants do you use?
[Message 92] Jamie: I'm curious too! What are some good natural dye sources?
[Message 93] River: I bet you could use things from your garden!
[Message 94] Sam: Yeah! Onion skins, avocado pits, coffee grounds… Lots of options.
[Message 95] Jordan: Wow, I never would have thought of that!
[Message 96] Alex: That's really clever!
[Message 97] Jamie: I might have to try that! I have tons of onion skins.
[Message 98] River: Experiment! See what colors you can get.
[Message 99] Sam: Be sure to research the process first! It can be a bit tricky.
[Message 100] Jordan: Good point, Sam!
[Message 101] Alex: Definitely do some research first.
[Message 102] Jamie: Okay, I’ll do my homework. Thanks, everyone!
[Message 103] River: No problem! Always happy to share crafting ideas.
[Message 104] Sam: Me too! It's fun to inspire each other.
[Message 105] Jordan: Agreed! Crafting is more fun with friends.
[Message 106] Alex: Absolutely! It's great to have a crafting community.
[Message 107] Jamie: I’m so glad we all connected!
[Message 108] River: Me too! We should do this again sometime.
[Message 109] Sam: Definitely! Maybe we can have a crafting night.
[Message 110] Jordan: That would be fun!
[Message 111] Alex: I'm in! Crafting night sounds awesome.
[Message 112] Jamie: I’m in too! Let’s plan something soon.
[Message 113] River: Great! I'll start brainstorming ideas.
[Message 114] Sam: Sounds good! I'm excited.
[Message 115] Jordan: Me too!
[Message 116] Alex: This is going to be fun! What are you crafting right now, River?
[Message 117] River: Besides thinking about bath bombs, I'm actually working on a cross-stitch project. It's a landscape.
[Message 118] Sam: Cross-stitch! I haven't done that in ages.
[Message 119] Jordan: I remember doing cross-stitch as a kid. It's so relaxing.
[Message 120] Alex: I admire your patience, River!
[Message 121] Jamie: Me too! Cross-stitch requires a lot of focus.
[Message 122] River: It's meditative, actually. Helps me unwind.
[Message 123] Sam: I can see that.
[Message 124] Jordan: That's a good way to de-stress.
[Message 125] Alex: Maybe I should try it sometime! Thanks for the inspiration, River!",0,

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, crazy. Two people… I can’t believe it.
[Message 3] NOAH: Brutal. Anyone know anything?
[Message 4] JASPER: Just rumors. Cops aren't saying much.
[Message 5] CHLOE: They said something about a golf club.
[Message 6] LIAM: A golf club? Seriously?
[Message 7] NOAH: That's messed up. Who even does that?
[Message 8] JASPER: People who are seriously messed up, that's who.
[Message 9] CHLOE: Did they say who it was?
[Message 10] LIAM: No names yet. Just that they're investigating.
[Message 11] NOAH: Wonder if it was gang-related.
[Message 12] JASPER: Fairgrounds... maybe.
[Message 13] CHLOE: I knew Sarah. She was a social worker. So kind.
[Message 14] LIAM: Oh man, really? That sucks, Chloe.
[Message 15] NOAH: Sorry to hear that.
[Message 16] JASPER: Damn.
[Message 17] CHLOE: Yeah. Just… awful.
[Message 18] LIAM: Did you know the other person, Chloe?
[Message 19] CHLOE: Not really. Just knew he was an activist. Worked with Sarah sometimes.
[Message 20] NOAH: So sad.
[Message 21] JASPER: Yeah, tragic.
[Message 22] CHLOE: Makes you think, you know?
[Message 23] LIAM: Definitely. Makes you appreciate what you have.
[Message 24] NOAH: Speaking of which, anyone wanna grab some food later? Distract ourselves?
[Message 25] JASPER: I'm in. Need something to take my mind off things.
[Message 26] CHLOE: I might be busy, but thanks.
[Message 27] LIAM: Alright, cool. Let me know, Chloe.
[Message 28] NOAH: Where should we go, Jasper?
[Message 29] JASPER: How about that new burger place downtown?
[Message 30] NOAH: Sounds good.
[Message 31] CHLOE: Just thinking about it… Sarah always stood up for everyone. Even when it was hard.
[Message 32] LIAM: She was a good person.
[Message 33] NOAH: Agreed.
[Message 34] JASPER: For sure.
[Message 35] CHLOE: Someone needs to pay for this.
[Message 36] LIAM: They will. The cops will find them.
[Message 37] NOAH: Hope they throw the book at them.
[Message 38] JASPER: They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 39] CHLOE: They deserve to.
[Message 40] LIAM: Totally.
[Message 41] NOAH: Absolutely.
[Message 42] JASPER: Anyway, gotta run some errands. See you later, Noah?
[Message 43] NOAH: Yep, see ya.
[Message 44] CHLOE: Later guys.
[Message 45] LIAM: Take care, Chloe.
[Message 46] CHLOE: You too, Liam.
[Message 47] JASPER: Later.
[Message 48] LIAM: (To Noah) Hey, you seen Kyle around?
[Message 49] NOAH: Kyle? Nah, haven't seen him in days. Why?
[Message 50] LIAM: Just wondering. He seemed kinda off last time I saw him.
[Message 51] NOAH: Off how?
[Message 52] LIAM: I don't know. Just… distant. And he was complaining about some activist guy always ""stirring things up"" or something.
[Message 53] NOAH: Weird. Kyle's usually pretty chill.
[Message 54] LIAM: Yeah, that's why it struck me as odd. He had short eyelashes if you get confused.
[Message 55] NOAH: Maybe he's just stressed about something.
[Message 56] LIAM: Maybe.
[Message 57] NOAH: You think he knew Sarah?
[Message 58] LIAM: I have no idea.
[Message 59] NOAH: Probably just a coincidence.
[Message 60] LIAM: Hopefully.
[Message 61] CHLOE: (To Liam) Hey, quick question, did you see anyone near the fairgrounds early this morning?
[Message 62] LIAM: Early this morning? Nah, I was still asleep. Why?
[Message 63] CHLOE: Just curious. Someone said they saw a familiar face.
[Message 64] LIAM: Who?
[Message 65] CHLOE: They didn't say.
[Message 66] LIAM: Creepy.
[Message 67] CHLOE: Tell me about it.
[Message 68] LIAM: Well, I was home all morning. You can ask my mom.
[Message 69] CHLOE: Okay. Thanks, Liam.
[Message 70] LIAM: No problem. Seriously, I was nowhere near there.
[Message 71] CHLOE: I believe you.
[Message 72] NOAH: (To Jasper) Hey, you going to the vigil tonight?
[Message 73] JASPER: For Sarah and… the other guy? Yeah, probably.
[Message 74] NOAH: I heard it was because he was an activist and was going to end his long-term abusive relationship.
[Message 75] JASPER: Yeah, makes sense to show respect.
[Message 76] NOAH: Thought you might be busy.
[Message 77] JASPER: I can make time for this.
[Message 78] NOAH: Cool.
[Message 79] CHLOE: (To everyone) Vigil tonight at the fairgrounds, 7 PM.
[Message 80] LIAM: Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 81] NOAH: See you there.
[Message 82] JASPER: I'll be there.
[Message 83] LIAM: (To Noah) Jasper seems extra keen to go.
[Message 84] NOAH: Maybe he just feels bad.
[Message 85] LIAM: Yeah, maybe.
[Message 86] CHLOE: (To Liam) Liam, did Kyle ever mention anything about Sarah to you?
[Message 87] LIAM: No, never. Why all the questions about Kyle?
[Message 88] CHLOE: Just trying to understand things.
[Message 89] LIAM: Understand what? You think Kyle did it?
[Message 90] CHLOE: I don't know what to think.
[Message 91] LIAM: That's messed up, Chloe.
[Message 92] CHLOE: Sorry.
[Message 93] LIAM: I gotta go.
[Message 94] CHLOE: Okay.
[Message 95] NOAH: (To Jasper) Hey man, you okay? You seem a little tense.
[Message 96] JASPER: Just tired. Long day.
[Message 97] NOAH: You sure? You were pretty quiet at the burger place.
[Message 98] JASPER: Yeah, I'm fine. Just… thinking about Sarah.
[Message 99] NOAH: Right.
[Message 100] JASPER: See you at the vigil.
[Message 101] NOAH: Yep.
[Message 102] CHLOE: (To Liam) Liam, one more thing. Did Kyle own a golf club?
[Message 103] LIAM: What the hell, Chloe? Why would you ask that? This is getting ridiculous.
[Message 104] CHLOE: Just answer the question.
[Message 105] LIAM: I don't know! I've never been to his house! Lay off, okay?
[Message 106] CHLOE: Fine.
[Message 107] LIAM: I'm done talking about this.
[Message 108] CHLOE: Whatever.
[Message 109] NOAH: (To Jasper) Heard they found the murder weapon. Golf club.
[Message 110] JASPER: Oh. Wow.
[Message 111] NOAH: Yeah. Crazy, right?
[Message 112] JASPER: Totally crazy.
[Message 113] CHLOE: (To Noah) Noah, I'm skipping the vigil. I can’t.

[Message 2] MARCO: Yeah, Chloe. Awful. Poor Mr. Peterson.

[Message 3] JAKE: Mr. Peterson? The Social Worker? What happened?

[Message 4] CHLOE: Murdered! Electrocution, they said. Right in the parking garage late morning.

[Message 5] JAKE: Electrocution? Seriously? Who would do that?

[Message 6] MARCO: No clue, Jake. Cops are all over the place. Pretty messed up.

[Message 7] CHLOE: I saw Billy near the Parking Garage that morning… said he was heading to the library.

[Message 8] JAKE: Billy? You mean that kid with the lisp? What would he be doing there?

[Message 9] MARCO: Leave Billy alone, Chloe. He's just a kid. Probably innocent.

[Message 10] CHLOE: I'm not accusing anyone! Just saying what I saw. He always hated Mr. Peterson because of some issues with his mom’s case.

[Message 11] JAKE: I heard Mr. Peterson was a real hard-ass on some of those cases. My cousin said he was unnecessarily strict.

[Message 12] MARCO: Guys, let’s not spread rumors. Someone lost their life.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Marco, chill. I just hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 14] JAKE: Agreed. Did either of you know him well?

[Message 15] MARCO: Just in passing. He helped my family once.

[Message 16] CHLOE: Never really talked to him, but I always saw him stressed out.

[Message 17] JAKE: Stressful job. Probably made him some enemies.

[Message 18] CHLOE: Maybe. Or maybe someone just snapped.

[Message 19] MARCO: I was actually at work all morning. Can't believe this happened.

[Message 20] JAKE: I was home, playing video games. Perfect alibi, I guess.

[Message 21] CHLOE: This whole thing is so creepy. I heard the security cameras were down.

[Message 22] MARCO: Seriously? That’s convenient for the killer.

[Message 23] JAKE: Weird, right? Makes you wonder if it was planned.

[Message 24] CHLOE: Billy told me he was looking up how to fix wires online last week...said his lamp was broken.

[Message 25] MARCO: Chloe, stop. You’re going to get him in trouble for nothing. That's probably just coincidence.

[Message 26] JAKE: Agreed. Let the cops do their job.

[Message 27] CHLOE: Fine, fine. But I still think it's weird. I also remember him being super mad after Mr. Peterson visited his house. Said he intended to get revenge.

[Message 28] MARCO: You are making this up. He's a kid.

[Message 29] JAKE: Dude, what if Billy tried something stupid and then panicked and didn't even call 911? That could have made it worse.

[Message 30] CHLOE: That's a thought, Jake.

[Message 31] MARCO: Both of you are jumping to conclusions! Seriously messed up.

[Message 32] CHLOE: Sorry, Marco. Just freaked out.

[Message 33] JAKE: Yeah, sorry. Didn't mean to accuse anyone.

[Message 89] Alex: ""That's what I like to hear! Have you read anything else good lately?""
[Message 90] Sam: ""I just finished 'Klara and the Sun' by Kazuo Ishiguro. It's really thought-provoking.""

[Message 92] Sam: ""Yeah, it's told from the perspective of the Artificial Friend. Really beautifully written.""
[Message 93] Alex: ""Ishiguro is such a great writer. I loved 'Never Let Me Go'.""

[Message 112] Alex: ""Wild ride? Even better!""
[Message 113] Jamie: ""So, I was thinking... have you ever tried fly fishing?""
[Message 114] Alex: ""Nope, never have! It looks pretty complicated.""
[Message 115] Jamie: ""It can be, but it's also really relaxing and rewarding. I could teach you sometime.""
[Message 116] Alex: ""That's a tempting offer! I might take you up on that.""

[Message 2] Kai: ""No, what's up?""
[Message 3] Liam: ""Apparently, River was found dead this morning. Suffocation with a pillow.""
[Message 4] Kai: ""River? Seriously? Damn. How?""
[Message 5] Marcus: ""Sunrise this morning. Place is a crime scene.""
[Message 6] Kai: ""Sunrise? I was still asleep then. Crazy.""
[Message 7] Marcus: ""Police are all over the place. Trenton PD ain't playing.""
[Message 8] Liam: ""They're saying it was murder.""
[Message 9] Kai: ""Who would do that? River was just a drug dealer.""
[Message 10] Liam: ""That's what I'm saying. Makes no sense.""
[Message 11] Marcus: ""Heard she was dealing to some shady characters. Could be anything.""
[Message 12] Kai: ""True. Still messed up.""
[Message 13] Liam: ""Yeah. So, you guys free later? Wanna grab a beer?""
[Message 14] Marcus: ""Can't. Got that thing I gotta do. Remeber""
[Message 15] Kai: ""I'm in. Need to take my mind off this River thing.""
[Message 16] Liam: ""Cool. 8 PM at O'Malley's?""
[Message 17] Kai: ""Sounds good.""
[Message 18] Marcus: ""Alright, catch you guys another time.""
[Message 19] Liam: ""Later, man.""
[Message 20] Kai: ""Peace.""
[Message 21] Marcus: ""Hey, Kai. Quick question. You knew River dealt, right?""
[Message 22] Kai: ""Yeah, everyone did. Why?""
[Message 23] Marcus: ""Just curious. Police will probably ask you anyway.""
[Message 24] Kai: ""Alright. Anything else?""
[Message 25] Marcus: ""Nah, that's it.""
[Message 26] Liam: ""Did either of you guys know Alex?""
[Message 27] Kai: ""The manager? Yeah, vaguely. Why?""
[Message 28] Liam: ""He was acting weird yesterday. Seemed stressed. Said he wanted to quit.""
[Message 29] Kai: ""Maybe he knew something was going down.""
[Message 30] Marcus: ""Or maybe he just hated his job.""
[Message 31] Liam: ""Could be. Just a thought.""
[Message 32] Kai: ""I'm still shocked about River. Seriously messed up.""
[Message 33] Marcus: ""You and me both, Kai. You and me both.""
[Message 34] Liam: ""Hey, you think it could be that guy, Ben? I heard they were fighting over something at the Coffee Shop last week.""
[Message 35] Kai: ""Ben? Nah, he seems harmless.""
[Message 36] Marcus: ""Don't judge a book by its cover, Liam.""
[Message 37] Liam: ""True.""
[Message 38] Kai: ""Anyway, gotta run. See you tonight, Liam.""
[Message 39] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 40] Marcus: ""Later.""
[Message 41] Liam: ""Marcus, you still there?""
[Message 42] Marcus: ""Yeah, what's up?""
[Message 43] Liam: ""Just thinking about River. You think the cops will find who did it?""
[Message 44] Marcus: ""Eventually. They always do.""
[Message 45] Liam: ""Hope so. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 46] Marcus: ""Yeah, no kidding.""
[Message 47] Kai: ""Anyone hear anything new about River?""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Nope. Just the same stuff on the news.""
[Message 49] Marcus: ""Word on the street is that River owed a lot of people money.""
[Message 50] Kai: ""That makes sense, I guess.""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Still doesn't justify murder.""
[Message 52] Marcus: ""True. But it's a motive.""
[Message 53] Kai: ""Hey, Liam, you remember seeing River yesterday?""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Yeah, briefly. Why?""
[Message 55] Kai: ""Just curious. Did she seem okay?""
[Message 56] Liam: ""Yeah, as far as I could tell. Just her usual withdrawn self.""

[Message 64] Liam: ""Speaking of detectives, did you guys see Detective Miller at the Coffee Shop?""
[Message 65] Kai: ""Yeah, I saw her.""

[Message 67] Liam: ""Hope she catches the person who did this to River.""

[Message 69] Marcus: ""Yeah, me three.""
[Message 70] Liam: ""Anyway, gotta get going. Later.""
[Message 71] Kai: ""See ya.""
[Message 72] Marcus: ""Peace.""
[Message 73] Marcus: ""Hey Kai, you think it was about the money or something else?""
[Message 74] Kai: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 75] Marcus: ""Like, maybe someone had a personal vendetta against River.""
[Message 76] Kai: ""Could be. You think so?""
[Message 77] Marcus: ""Just a thought. River wasn't exactly the most popular person.""
[Message 78] Kai: ""True.""
[Message 79] Liam: ""This whole thing is messed up. I'm going to be thinking about this for a while.""
[Message 80] Kai: ""Me too. Poor River.""
[Message 81] Marcus: ""Yeah, it's rough.""
[Message 82] Liam: ""You guys know anyone who really hated River?""
[Message 83] Kai: ""Not really. She kept to herself.""
[Message 84] Marcus: ""Maybe Ben. He was shouting probably provoked him after she fired him""
[Message 85] Liam: ""He did seem pretty angry. Could have made him act purposefully.""
[Message 86] Kai: ""Could be, I guess. But it doesn't seem like him.""
[Message 87] Marcus: ""You never know what someone is capable of.""

[Message 93] Marcus: ""Nah, why would I?""
[Message 94] Liam: ""Just curious. You know, since she was dealing and all.""
[Message 95] Marcus: ""I stay out of that stuff, Liam. You know that.""
[Message 96] Liam: ""Yeah, just asking.""
[Message 97] Marcus: ""Alright. Well, I'm busy. Talk later.""
[Message 98] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 99] Kai: ""Anyone hear anything about a suspect?""
[Message 100] Liam: ""Not a peep. Cops are keeping quiet.""
[Message 101] Marcus: ""That's how they operate.""
[Message 102] Kai: ""I hope they catch the guy who did this soon.""
[Message 103] Liam: ""Me too.""
[Message 104] Marcus: ""Yeah, this kind of thing can't go unpunished.""
[Message 105] Liam: ""You think it was planned?""
[Message 106] Kai: ""Hard to say. Could have been a spur-of-the-moment thing.""
[Message 107] Marcus: ""I bet he was looking up how to make Suffocation with a pillow online, and got obsessed""
[Message 108] Liam: ""Maybe you're right. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 109] Kai: ""Yeah, I don't know about that. But they need to pay for what they did.""
[Message 110] Marcus: ""Agreed.""

[Message 2] MARK: Yeah, Chloe, it's awful. I can't believe it.

[Message 3] LIAM: Terrible. She was always so optimistic. Remember that time she organized the Airport clean-up?

[Message 4] ANNA: It is insane. Predawn?! Seriously? I was asleep.

[Message 5] JAKE: Yeah, I heard. Rough stuff. Anyone know any details?

[Message 6] CHLOE: Not really, just what's on the news. So scary this happened in Shreveport.

[Message 7] MARK: They're saying it was strangulation.

[Message 8] LIAM: Asphyxiation by strangulation, right? Brutal.

[Message 9] ANNA: That's horrible. Poor Sarah.

[Message 10] JAKE: Sounds like they're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 11] CHLOE: Seriously! I can't even imagine. Hey, anyone free for coffee later?

[Message 12] MARK: Can't, got a meeting. Maybe tomorrow?

[Message 13] LIAM: I’m in, Chloe! Need to get my mind off this.

[Message 14] ANNA: I’m good for coffee.

[Message 15] JAKE: Maybe later. Got errands.

[Message 16] CHLOE: Okay, Liam, Anna, let's say 3pm at Java Java?

[Message 17] MARK: Quick question, did anyone see David (Suspect 1) around yesterday? He wasn't at work.

[Message 18] LIAM: Java Java sounds good.

[Message 19] ANNA: Sounds great! See you then.

[Message 20] JAKE: David? Nah.

[Message 21] CHLOE: David called in sick. He mentioned he had a bad cough last week.

[Message 22] MARK: That's right. Completely forgot.

[Message 23] LIAM: Bad cough doesn’t equal…this.

[Message 24] ANNA: Exactly, Liam. People get sick.

[Message 25] JAKE: True. So, back to normal life then?

[Message 26] CHLOE: Not really, Jake, someone died.

[Message 27] MARK: This whole thing is just unsettling. I had drinks with Sarah last week.

[Message 28] LIAM: Really? Where?

[Message 29] ANNA: Seriously, Mark? Why would you bring that up?

[Message 30] JAKE: Yeah, dude. Little insensitive.

[Message 31] CHLOE: Mark, maybe keep that to yourself for now.

[Message 32] MARK: I didn't mean anything by it. Just saying. We talked about her plans for her activist work. She was so passionate.

[Message 33] LIAM: Okay, fair enough.

[Message 34] ANNA: Just be careful what you say, Mark.

[Message 35] JAKE: Word. So anyone know Kevin (Suspect 3)?

[Message 36] CHLOE: Vaguely. Works downtown, right?

[Message 37] MARK: Yeah, I think I've seen him around. Why?

[Message 38] LIAM: Kevin? Isn't he the one with… issues?

[Message 39] ANNA: Issues? What kind of issues?

[Message 40] JAKE: Heard he's got a temper.

[Message 41] CHLOE: Oh great, now we're speculating. This is getting us nowhere.

[Message 42] MARK: Just trying to figure things out, Chloe.

[Message 43] LIAM: Me too. Just trying to make sense of this.

[Message 44] ANNA: Let the police do their job.

[Message 45] JAKE: Yeah, good point.

[Message 46] CHLOE: Okay, let's drop it. See you guys later.

[Message 47] MARK: Later.

[Message 48] LIAM: Later.

[Message 49] ANNA: Bye.

[Message 50] JAKE: Peace.

[Message 51] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) Hey, you free to chat later tonight? Something’s bothering me.

[Message 52] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) Sure, what's up?

[Message 53] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) I don't want to say it in the group, but I saw Kevin leaving Sarah’s building at predawn that night.

[Message 54] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) Seriously? You saw him?

[Message 55] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) Yeah. Positive. He looked… agitated.

[Message 56] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) Oh my god. You have to tell the police.

[Message 57] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) I know, I know. Just wanted to tell someone first.

[Message 58] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) I understand. This is huge. Do you know why Kevin always hated her?

[Message 59] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) I think it was something about his business. Sarah’s activism was interfering with it.

[Message 60] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) Makes sense. Call them, Liam. Please.

[Message 61] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) Okay, I will. Thanks, Anna.

[Message 62] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) Hey Chloe, you think Liam knows something he's not saying?

[Message 63] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) What do you mean?

[Message 64] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) Just seems like he's acting weird. He kept pushing about where I had drinks with Sarah.

[Message 65] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) He’s probably just worried like the rest of us. Don't read too much into it.

[Message 66] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) Maybe you’re right. Just a feeling.

[Message 67] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) Focus on remembering everything you discussed with Sarah. That'll be more helpful.

[Message 68] JAKE: (Private message to DAVID) Yo, you good? Heard you called out sick yesterday.

[Message 69] DAVID: (Private message to JAKE) Yeah, man, just a bad cold. Thanks for checking in.

[Message 70] JAKE: (Private message to DAVID) No prob. Stay hydrated. You hear about Sarah?

[Message 71] DAVID: (Private message to JAKE) Yeah, awful. Crazy.

[Message 72] JAKE: (Private message to DAVID) Fr. Heard it was strangulation. Hope they catch the creep.

[Message 73] DAVID: (Private message to JAKE) Me too. Catch you later.

[Message 74] JAKE: (Private message to DAVID) Aight.

[Message 75] ANNA: (Group Chat) Has anyone heard from the police yet?

[Message 76] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Not me. I guess they’re still investigating.

[Message 77] MARK: (Group Chat) I haven't either.

[Message 78] LIAM: (Group Chat) Nope.

[Message 79] JAKE: (Group Chat) Nah.

[Message 80] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Maybe we should all be prepared to answer questions.

[Message 81] MARK: (Group Chat) Good point, Chloe.

[Message 82] LIAM: (Group Chat) Yeah, probably a good idea.

[Message 83] ANNA: (Group Chat) Definitely.

[Message 84] JAKE: (Group Chat) Whatever.

[Message 85] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Anyone know if Sarah had any enemies?

[Message 86] MARK: (Group Chat) Not that I know of. Everyone loved her.

[Message 87] LIAM: (Group Chat) She was pretty outspoken. That might have rubbed some people the wrong way.

[Message 88] ANNA: (Group Chat) Liam has a point. Activists often make enemies.

[Message 89] JAKE: (Group Chat) Maybe someone she protested?

[Message 90] CHLOE: (Group Chat) That's a good line of inquiry for the police.

[Message 91] MARK: (Group Chat) I still can't believe this happened. It feels surreal.

[Message 92] LIAM: (Group Chat) I keep thinking about her family. They must be devastated.

[Message 93] ANNA: (Group Chat) Absolutely heartbreaking.

[Message 94] JAKE: (Group Chat) Sucks.

[Message 95] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Okay, let’s try to focus on something else for a bit. This is getting too heavy.

[Message 96] MARK: (Group Chat) Agreed. Movie night at my place this weekend?

[Message 97] LIAM: (Group Chat) I’m in!

[Message 98] ANNA: (Group Chat) Sounds good.

[Message 99] JAKE: (Group Chat) Maybe. Depends.

[Message 100] CHLOE: (Group Chat) I’ll bring the popcorn!

[Message 101] ANNA: (Private message to MARK) You okay? You seem really shaken up about Sarah.

[Message 102] MARK: (Private message to ANNA) I am. We were friends. It’s just… I feel like I should have seen something.

[Message 103] ANNA: (Private message to MARK) You couldn't have known, Mark. Don't blame yourself.

[Message 104] MARK: (Private message to ANNA) I just keep thinking about what we talked about. About how she was trying to expose some shady dealings downtown.

[Message 105] ANNA: (Private message to MARK) Shady dealings? What do you mean?

[Message 106] MARK: (Private message to ANNA) I don’t know all the details. Something about Kevin’s business practices.

[Message 107] ANNA: (Private message to MARK) Kevin again? This is getting strange.

[Message 108] MARK: (Private message to ANNA) I know, right? But I don’t want to jump to conclusions.

[Message 109] ANNA: (Private message to MARK) Me neither. But it’s definitely worth mentioning to the police.

[Message 110] MARK: (Private message to ANNA) I will. Thanks, Anna.

[Message 111] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Hey, you doing okay? You seemed pretty upset earlier.

[Message 112] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Yeah, just a lot to process. Thanks for asking.

[Message 113] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Of course. Anything I can do?

[Message 114] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Not really. Just… try to be normal, I guess.

[Message 115] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Easier said than done, right? But I’ll try.

[Message 116] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Appreciate it.

[Message 117] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Get some rest. We’ll talk soon.

[Message 118] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Thanks, David. You too.

[Message 119] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) Just got off the phone with the police. Told them everything I saw.

[Message 120] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) Good for you, Liam. You did the right thing.

[Message 121] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) I hope so. I feel terrible.

[Message 122] ANNA: (Private message to LIAM) You did what you could. It’s not your fault, no matter what Kevin’s mens rea was.

[Message 123] LIAM: (Private message to ANNA) Thanks, Anna.

[Message 124] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) Police just called me. Asking me to come in for questioning tomorrow.

[Message 125] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) Okay. Just be honest and tell them everything you know.

[Message 126] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) I will. I’m just nervous.

[Message 127] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) It’s okay to be nervous. Just stay calm and tell the truth.

[Message 128] MARK: (Private message to CHLOE) I will. Thanks, Chloe. You’re a good friend.

[Message 129] CHLOE: (Private message to MARK) Anytime, Mark.

[Message 130] JAKE: (Private message to ANNA) Heard Liam snitched on Kevin (Suspect 3). True?

[Message 131] ANNA: (Private message to JAKE) I can't confirm or deny anything.

[Message 132] JAKE: (Private message to ANNA) Figures. This whole thing is messed up.

[Message 133] ANNA: (Private message to JAKE) Agreed.

[Message 134] JAKE: (Private message to ANNA) Hope they sort it out soon.

[Message 135] ANNA: (Private message to JAKE) Me too.

[Message 136] LIAM: (Group Chat) Anyone else get a call from the police?

[Message 137] ANNA: (Group Chat) Not yet.

[Message 138] CHLOE: (Group Chat) No.

[Message 139] MARK: (Group Chat) I did. Going in tomorrow.

[Message 140] JAKE: (Group Chat) Sheesh.

[Message 141] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Good luck, Mark.

[Message 142] ANNA: (Group Chat) Yeah, good luck.

[Message 143] LIAM: (Group Chat) Let us know how it goes.

[Message 144] MARK: (Group Chat) Will do.

[Message 145] JAKE: (Group Chat) Whatever.

[Message 146] CHLOE: (Private message to LIAM) Are you okay with Mark going in for questioning? He seemed a little weirded out when you were asking questions.

[Message 147] LIAM: (Private message to CHLOE) I'm fine. If he saw something, he needs to say it. It's the right thing to do, even if it’s hard. It's important for causation. I just want the right people to be punished.

[Message 148] CHLOE: (Private message to LIAM) True. I guess.

[Message 149] LIAM: (Private message to CHLOE) How are you holding up?

[Message 150] CHLOE: (Private message to LIAM) As well as can be expected. Thanks for asking.

[Message 151] LIAM: (Private message to CHLOE) Anytime. We'll get through this.

[Message 152] CHLOE: (Private message to LIAM) I hope so.

[Message 153] JAKE: (Group Chat) So, what's everyone having for dinner? Distract ourselves.

[Message 154] ANNA: (Group Chat) Pizza.

[Message 155] MARK: (Group Chat) Probably just a sandwich. Too stressed to cook.

[Message 156] LIAM: (Group Chat) Same. Cereal maybe.

[Message 157] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Ordering in some Thai.

[Message 158] JAKE: (Group Chat) Nice. I'm thinking burgers.

[Message 159] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Hey, I just wanted to let you know that Mark is going to the police station tomorrow to answer some questions.

[Message 160] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

[Message 161] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) I just thought you should be aware.

[Message 162] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) I appreciate it.

[Message 163] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) How are you feeling? Any better?

[Message 164] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) A little. Still coughing.

[Message 165] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Get some rest. Drink plenty of fluids.

[Message 166] DAVID: (Private message to CHLOE) Will do. Thanks again.

[Message 167] CHLOE: (Private message to DAVID) Anytime.

[Message 168] JAKE: (Private message to KEVIN) Yo, heard Liam told the cops you were at Sarah's (Victim's) the night she died. You in trouble bro?

[Message 169] KEVIN: (Private message to JAKE) That lying scumbag! I'm gonna make him pay for this. He probably INTENDED for this to happen and is now putting it on me.

[Message 170] JAKE: (Private message to KEVIN) Damn, so you DID go there?

[Message 171] KEVIN: (Private message to JAKE) Doesn't matter what happened. That loser better watch his back.

[Message 172] JAKE: (Private message to KEVIN) Alright man, just stay cool. Don't do anything stupid.

[Message 173] KEVIN: (Private message to JAKE) Too late for that.

[Message 174] JAKE: (Private message to KEVIN) ...

[Message 175] DAVID: (Private message to JAKE) If Kevin goes down for this, I'm going down with him. That stupid activist wouldn't leave him alone. This is all her fault.",1,

[Message 2] Ben: Absolutely! I've been itching to try something new.
[Message 3] Chloe: I'm in! Though my crafting skills are a bit… rusty.
[Message 4] David: Don't worry, Chloe! We're all here to learn. I'm excited to see what we come up with.
[Message 5] Emily: Me too! Any initial thoughts?
[Message 6] Alex: I was thinking maybe some simple macrame plant hangers?
[Message 7] Ben: Ooh, I like that! Easy and practical.
[Message 8] Chloe: Macrame sounds fun! I've always wanted to try that.
[Message 9] David: Good suggestion, Alex. I'm on board.
[Message 10] Emily: Perfect! Anyone have macrame cord?
[Message 11] Alex: I think I have some leftover from a previous project. I can bring it.
[Message 12] Ben: Awesome! I can bring some small pots for the plants.
[Message 13] Chloe: I might have some decorative beads we could add. I'll check.
[Message 14] David: I can look up some different knotting techniques online.
[Message 15] Emily: Great teamwork! What time should we aim to start on Saturday?
[Message 16] Alex: How about 2 PM?
[Message 17] Ben: Works for me.
[Message 18] Chloe: Sounds good.
[Message 19] David: Perfect.
[Message 20] Emily: 2 PM it is!
[Message 21] Alex: Fantastic! Looking forward to it.
[Message 22] Ben: Me too! It'll be a nice break.
[Message 23] Chloe: Definitely!
[Message 24] David: Absolutely.
[Message 25] Emily: Speaking of breaks, anyone catch that new episode of “Bake Off”?
[Message 26] Alex: Not yet, but I've heard good things!
[Message 27] Ben: I did! That chocolate sculpture challenge was insane.
[Message 28] Chloe: I need to watch it!
[Message 29] David: I’ll have to add it to my watchlist.
[Message 30] Emily: It's a must-see. Anyway, back to crafting...
[Message 31] Alex: Right! So, macrame is the main project, but maybe we could have some other options too?
[Message 32] Ben: Like what?
[Message 33] Chloe: Maybe some card making? I have a bunch of old cards I could recycle.
[Message 34] David: That's a great idea, Chloe!
[Message 35] Emily: I love that!
[Message 36] Alex: Excellent! We can have a macrame station and a card-making station.
[Message 37] Ben: Perfect!
[Message 38] Chloe: I'll bring the cards, scissors, and glue.
[Message 39] David: I might have some extra glitter… if anyone's brave enough.
[Message 40] Emily: Oh, bring the glitter! We need some sparkle.
[Message 41] Alex: Haha, okay, sounds good!
[Message 42] Ben: This is going to be fun!
[Message 43] Chloe: I'm excited!
[Message 44] David: Me too!
[Message 45] Emily: So, macrame and card making... anything else?
[Message 46] Alex: Maybe some simple origami?
[Message 47] Ben: Origami is cool!
[Message 48] Chloe: I'm terrible at origami, but I'm willing to try!
[Message 49] David: I know a few basic folds. I can teach.
[Message 50] Emily: Perfect! We'll have a crafting buffet.
[Message 51] Alex: Exactly!
[Message 52] Ben: I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!
[Message 53] Chloe: Speaking of which, should we plan some snacks?
[Message 54] David: Good call, Chloe.
[Message 55] Emily: Definitely. I can bring some cookies.
[Message 56] Alex: I can bring some fruit.
[Message 57] Ben: I'll grab some chips and dip.
[Message 58] Chloe: Perfect! We're all set.
[Message 59] David: This is going to be the best crafting session ever.
[Message 60] Emily: I agree!
[Message 61] Alex: Can't wait!
[Message 62] Ben: Me neither!
[Message 63] Chloe: Me three!
[Message 64] David: Four!
[Message 65] Emily: Okay, I think we've got everything covered.
[Message 66] Alex: Yep!
[Message 67] Ben: Awesome!
[Message 68] Chloe: Great!
[Message 69] David: Perfect!
[Message 70] Emily: Just a quick reminder, does everyone know where the conference room is?
[Message 71] Alex: I do.
[Message 72] Ben: Yep.
[Message 73] Chloe: I think so, but maybe send me the room number just in case?
[Message 74] David: Sure, send it to Chloe.
[Message 75] Emily: Will do, Chloe! Just sent it.
[Message 76] Alex: Cool.
[Message 77] Ben: Got it.
[Message 78] Chloe: Thanks!
[Message 79] David: No problem!

[Message 85] Emily: Bye everyone! Have a good night.
[Message 86] Alex: You too!
[Message 87] Ben: You too!
[Message 88] Chloe: Good night!
[Message 89] David: Good night!
[Message 90] Emily: (Silence for a few hours)
[Message 91] Alex: (The next day) Hey guys! Random question – has anyone interviewed for a marketing position at Zenith Corp?
[Message 92] Ben: I think my cousin did a while back. Said it was pretty standard.
[Message 93] Chloe: My neighbor actually works there! I can ask her about the interview process if you want.
[Message 94] David: That would be amazing, Chloe! Thanks!
[Message 95] Emily: Good luck with the interview, Alex!
[Message 96] Alex: Thanks, Emily! Appreciate it! Chloe, if you could ask your neighbor, that would be a huge help!
[Message 97] Ben: Yeah, good luck Alex!
[Message 98] Chloe: Sure thing, Alex! I'll text her now and see if she's free to chat.
[Message 99] David: Let us know what she says!
[Message 100] Emily: Fingers crossed for you, Alex!
[Message 101] Alex: Thanks, everyone! You're the best.
[Message 102] Ben: No problem! We're all in this together.
[Message 103] Chloe: Okay, she just replied! She said the interview focuses a lot on problem-solving skills and creativity.
[Message 104] David: Good to know!
[Message 105] Emily: That's helpful!
[Message 106] Alex: Awesome! I’ll make sure to highlight my experience with those. Thanks so much, Chloe!
[Message 107] Ben: Definitely emphasize those skills!
[Message 108] Chloe: No problem, Alex! Glad I could help.
[Message 109] David: You got this, Alex!
[Message 110] Emily: Knock 'em dead!
[Message 111] Alex: I appreciate all the support! Now, back to thinking about those macrame knots...
[Message 112] Ben: Haha, good transition!
[Message 113] Chloe: Yes, less job interview stress, more crafting fun!
[Message 114] David: Exactly! Let's get excited about Saturday!
[Message 115] Emily: I'm already picturing all the amazing things we're going to create!
[Message 116] Alex: Me too! I'm especially looking forward to the origami.
[Message 117] Ben: I'm going to try to make a crane, even if it looks like a crumpled piece of paper.
[Message 118] Chloe: I'll stick to the easier shapes, like boxes and maybe a simple flower.
[Message 119] David: I'll teach everyone how to make a jumping frog. It's a classic!
[Message 120] Emily: Ooh, I want to learn that!
[Message 121] Alex: Sounds like we have a plan!
[Message 122] Ben: Let the crafting commence! (On Saturday, of course)
[Message 123] Chloe: I'm already counting down the hours!
[Message 124] David: Me too! It's going to be a blast.
[Message 125] Emily: Okay, I'm going to go do some prep work for the cookies.
[Message 126] Alex: Sounds good!
[Message 127] Ben: Have fun!
[Message 128] Chloe: Bye for now!
[Message 129] David: See ya!

[Message 131] Alex: Bye!
[Message 132] Ben: Later!
[Message 133] Chloe: Ciao!
[Message 134] David: Adios!
[Message 135] Alex: Still thinking about Zenith Corp…
[Message 136] Ben: Don't stress! You'll do great!
[Message 137] Chloe: Exactly! Focus on your strengths.
[Message 138] David: And remember what my neighbor said about problem-solving!
[Message 139] Emily: You've got this!
[Message 140] Alex: Thanks, guys! I needed that pep talk.
[Message 141] Ben: Anytime!
[Message 142] Chloe: We're here for you!
[Message 143] David: Always!
[Message 144] Emily: Now, back to crafting... I'm off to measure cookie ingredients!

[Message 4] Chloe: Did something happen at University last night? I heard sirens.

[Message 5] Sarah: Yeah, Chloe, it was crazy. Heard it was near the corrections office.

[Message 6] Maya: Just rumors, probably. You know how University is.

[Message 7] Liam: True. Anyone know if Professor Davies is still giving that pop quiz on Friday?

[Message 8] Chloe: Ugh, don't remind me, Liam. I'm so behind.

[Message 9] Sarah: Seriously. Anyone catch the basketball game?

[Message 10] Maya: I did! Anderson High killed it.

[Message 11] Liam: Nice! I was stuck studying.

[Message 12] Chloe: Lucky you. I was working.

[Message 13] Sarah: So, back to the sirens… anyone know anything real?

[Message 14] Maya: Stop being nosy, Sarah. It's probably nothing.

[Message 15] Liam: Yeah, let the police handle it. More worried about that quiz.

[Message 16] Chloe: Fair enough. Anyone want to study together on Thursday?

[Message 26] Liam: Later.

[Message 27] Sarah: So, Liam, what did you do last night?

[Message 28] Liam: Studied, like I said. Why?

[Message 29] Sarah: Just curious. You seemed quick to dismiss the sirens.

[Message 30] Liam: Just don't like gossip. It was probably just a loud party.

[Message 31] Chloe: I still think something bad happened. It was late.

[Message 32] Sarah: Me too.

[Message 33] Liam: Whatever. I'm out.

[Message 34] Chloe: Okay bye.

[Message 35] Sarah: Later, Liam.

[Message 37] Sarah: What's up?

[Message 38] Maya: Can you tell Chloe I can't make the study session? Something came up.

[Message 39] Sarah: Sure, but why don't you tell her yourself?

[Message 40] Maya: I'm kinda avoiding her right now. Don't ask.

[Message 41] Sarah: Okay… weird. But fine.

[Message 42] Maya: Thanks, you're the best.

[Message 43] Sarah: No problem.

[Message 44] Chloe: Sarah, did Maya say anything about last night?

[Message 45] Sarah: No, why?

[Message 46] Chloe: Just seemed like she was acting weird.

[Message 47] Sarah: She did ask me to tell you she can't make the study session.

[Message 48] Chloe: See? Weird. Something's definitely up.

[Message 55] Liam: A friend of a friend. Said it was pretty bad.

[Message 56] Chloe: Oh my god, that's awful.

[Message 57] Sarah: Who was it? Do they know?

[Message 58] Liam: No details. Just that it happened.

[Message 59] Maya: This is getting out of hand. Stop spreading rumors.

[Message 60] Chloe: It's not a rumor if someone DIED, Maya!

[Message 61] Sarah: I agree with Chloe. This is serious.

[Message 62] Liam: Maybe Maya knows something she's not telling us?

[Message 63] Maya: What? That's ridiculous, Liam! I was at home ALL night.

[Message 64] Chloe: Were you really, Maya?

[Message 65] Sarah: Yeah, Maya, where were you?

[Message 72] Liam: What true crime documentary?

[Message 73] Maya: I don't know! Some one about stabbing with an ice pick or something! Why does it matter?

[Message 74] Chloe: It matters because someone was stabbed, maybe with stabbing with an ice pick, near the corrections office where 5.  Corrections Officer works!

[Message 75] Sarah: Wow, Maya. That's… a lot.

[Message 76] Maya: It's a coincidence! I watch those all the time.

[Message 77] Liam: I’m done with this, going back to studying.

[Message 78] Chloe: Yeah, me too. This is too heavy.

[Message 79] Sarah: Agreed. Later.

[Message 80] Maya: Whatever. Leave me alone.

[Message 81] Chloe: Sarah, I'm really worried about Maya.

[Message 82] Sarah: Me too. She's acting so guilty.

[Message 83] Chloe: What do we do?

[Message 84] Sarah: I don't know… should we go to the police?

[Message 85] Chloe: I don't want to get her in trouble if she's innocent.

[Message 86] Sarah: True. But what if she's not?

[Message 87] Chloe: Maybe we should try talking to her again first?

[Message 88] Sarah: Okay. But I'm not going alone.

[Message 89] Chloe: Me neither. Let's do it tomorrow?

[Message 90] Sarah: Deal.

[Message 91] Chloe: Hey Maya, can we talk?

[Message 92] Maya: About what? To repeat myself that I am innocent?

[Message 93] Chloe: About what happened last night. About 5.  Corrections Officer.

[Message 94] Maya: I told you, I was at home. What more do you want?

[Message 95] Chloe: We just want to understand.

[Message 96] Maya: There's nothing to understand! Leave me alone! I was watching TV.

[Message 97] Sarah: Did you know 5.  Corrections Officer?

[Message 98] Maya: No! Why would I?

[Message 99] Chloe: You seemed pretty freaked out when Liam mentioned the corrections office.

[Message 100] Maya: I just… I don't like hearing about people dying. It scares me.

[Message 101] Sarah: You should try to protect someone for me.

[Message 102] Chloe: Who were you protecting, Maya?

[Message 103] Maya: No one! I swear! I didn't even know him!

[Message 104] Sarah: You're lying, Maya. We can tell.

[Message 105] Maya: I'm not! Please just believe me!

[Message 106] Chloe: Then tell us the truth.

[Message 107] Maya: I… I can't.

[Message 108] Sarah: That's it. We're going to the police.

[Message 109] Maya: No! Please don't!

[Message 110] Chloe: Tell us what happened, and maybe we can help you.

[Message 111] Maya: Okay, fine! But you have to promise not to tell anyone else.

[Message 112] Sarah: We can't promise that, Maya. But we'll listen.

[Message 113] Maya: Ugh, I hate him. He knows what to do. He knew what he intended to do! 

[Message 114] Chloe: Who Maya! Who are you talking about?

[Message 115] Maya: No one. Forget I said anything.

[Message 116] Sarah: Maya, who is ""he""?

[Message 117] Maya: He, um, he sells me stuff.

[Message 118] Chloe: Sarah, shes deflecting.

[Message 119] Sarah: I know.

[Message 120] Maya: I was with Liam. 

[Message 121] Chloe: You were with Liam last night?

[Message 122] Maya: Yeah, we hung out.

[Message 123] Sarah: Liam said he was studying.

[Message 124] Maya: He lied. He lies all the time.

[Message 125] Chloe: I'm confused.

[Message 126] Sarah: Me too. Liam, where are you?

[Message 127] Liam: I’m here. What's up?

[Message 128] Sarah: Maya says you were with her last night. Is that true?

[Message 129] Liam: Absolutely not. I was studying at the library until late.

[Message 130] Chloe: Maya, why did you lie?

[Message 131] Maya: I... I don't know! I panicked!

[Message 132] Sarah: You're making this worse, Maya.

[Message 133] Liam: She knew. She was aware.

[Message 134] Chloe: What do you mean, Liam?

[Message 135] Liam: Nothing. Forget I said that.

[Message 136] Sarah: No, Liam, tell us!

[Message 137] Liam: I can't. It's too much. I saw him leave the building at Evening.

[Message 138] Chloe: You saw who leave the building, Liam?

[Message 139] Liam: It was 5.  Corrections Officer.

[Message 140] Sarah: 5.  Corrections Officer?

[Message 141] Liam: I saw him walk out.

[Message 142] Chloe: But the person who died *was* 5.  Corrections Officer. So what does that even mean.

[Message 143] Sarah: Liam are you okay. 

[Message 144] Maya: Chloe, tell the truth now?

[Message 145] Chloe: Im trying to process the information. What information are you not telling me?!

[Message 146] Sarah: Stop dodging. What do you know.

[Message 147] Liam: I just saw him leave. I swear.

[Message 148] Chloe: Sarah, lets just got to the cops with this.

[Message 149] Sarah: Yeah, lets go.

[Message 150] Maya: I didn't do anything. I just wanted to get rid of him.

[Message 151] Chloe: You wanted to kill 5.  Corrections Officer?!

[Message 152] Sarah: What the hell, Maya?

[Message 153] Maya: I didn't do it! I just… I wished it.

[Message 154] Liam: I knew it.

[Message 155] Chloe: He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.

[Message 156] Sarah: Hurt who Liam? Chloe?

[Message 157] Liam: I just mean you shouldn't talk bad things about 5.  Corrections Officer!

[Message 158] Chloe: I am at my wits end. You are all being so shady!

[Message 159] Sarah: This is more intense than I thought.

[Message 160] Maya: It's like everyone is trying to hide something. 

[Message 161] Liam: I saw him buy a stabbing with an ice pick at the store!

[Message 162] Chloe: 5.  Corrections Officer bought a stabbing with an ice pick.

[Message 163] Sarah: When Liam? Why stabbing with an ice pick?

[Message 164] Liam: I dont know why stabbing with an ice pick.

[Message 165] Maya: Guys I think we have to go to the police.

[Message 166] Chloe: Agree. But i want to confirm all of this.

[Message 167] Sarah: Who do you trust more, liam or maya?

[Message 168] Chloe: That's hard. They both have motives.

[Message 169] Maya: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened!

[Message 170] Liam: You know what, maybe I am going to go to jail.

[Message 171] Chloe: Oh no. You think your going to go to jail.

[Message 172] Sarah: I hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 173] Maya: I just told you what I know. 

[Message 174] Liam: I did too!

[Message 175] Chloe: Well lets find out.

[Message 176] Sarah: Okay lets go!

[Message 177] Chloe: This has all been too much. 

[Message 178] Liam: Agreed. Never would of thought this would happen.

[Message 179] Sarah: Seriously. 

[Message 180] Maya: Lets just get to the police.

[Message 181] Chloe: Okay. I'm ready when you are.

[Message 182] Sarah: Lets leave right now.

[Message 183] Liam: Should we get a lawyer.

[Message 41] Anya: ""I don't know details. But maybe that's connected?""
[Message 42] Lena: ""That could be it. God, this is like a movie.""
[Message 43] Anya: ""Too real for me. Hey, you doing okay?""
[Message 44] Lena: ""Yeah, just shaken. I feel like I'm being watched, you know?""
[Message 45] Anya: ""I get it. Paranoia is contagious. Maybe take a break from the news?""
[Message 46] Lena: ""Good idea. Booksmart it is then!""
[Message 47] Anya: ""Exactly! Let's forget about all this for a while.""
[Message 48] Kai: ""The Electric is dead. Heading home. Night.""
[Message 49] Anya: ""Night, Kai.""
[Message 50] Lena: ""Sleep well.""
[Message 51] Anya: ""Hey Lena, something's been bugging me. Did you see anything weird the past few days?""
[Message 52] Lena: ""Weird how? Like...ghosts?""
[Message 53] Anya: ""No, like… unusual behavior from anyone we know.""
[Message 54] Lena: ""Now that you mention it, I did see Kai arguing with someone outside the gallery last week. Seemed intense.""
[Message 55] Anya: ""Really? Who?""
[Message 56] Lena: ""I couldn't tell. It was dark. But Kai seemed really angry. He always hated 3.  Taxi Driver""
[Message 57] Anya: ""Huh. That's...interesting.""
[Message 58] Lena: ""Maybe it's nothing. But it stuck with me.""
[Message 59] Anya: ""No, tell me more. What else?""
[Message 60] Lena: ""Nothing concrete. Just a feeling.""
[Message 61] Anya: ""Feelings matter. Don't dismiss them.""
[Message 62] Kai: ""Morning, ladies. Rough night. Headache from hell.""
[Message 63] Anya: ""Morning, Kai. You okay?""
[Message 64] Lena: ""Yeah, you sound awful.""
[Message 65] Kai: ""Just a hangover. The Electric's tequila is lethal. Anyway, what's up?""
[Message 66] Anya: ""Just chatting.""
[Message 67] Lena: ""Anya was asking if I'd seen anything strange lately.""
[Message 68] Kai: ""Strange how?""
[Message 69] Lena: ""Just...anything out of the ordinary.""
[Message 70] Kai: ""Nah, same old same old. Why?""
[Message 71] Anya: ""No reason. Just curious.""
[Message 72] Lena: ""So, that case David was involved in...scary.""
[Message 73] Kai: ""Yeah, that's messed up. Hope they find whoever did this soon. They're going away for a long time for this""
[Message 74] Anya: ""Me too. For everyone's sake.""
[Message 75] Lena: ""I still can't shake this feeling that something isn't right.""
[Message 76] Anya: ""I know. Me neither. Trust your gut.""
[Message 77] Kai: ""Gut feelings are usually indigestion. Just saying.""
[Message 78] Lena: ""Maybe, but sometimes they're more than that.""
[Message 79] Anya: ""True. So, Kai, you were at Marty's PM, then The Electric? That's it?""
[Message 80] Kai: ""Yeah, why? You think I was out murdering people? He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there""
[Message 81] Anya: ""Just asking. Police are gonna ask the same thing.""
[Message 82] Kai: ""True. Well, that's where I was. End of story.""
[Message 83] Lena: ""Speaking of the police, I saw them at the gallery again this morning. Seemed like they were focusing on the back entrance.""
[Message 84] Anya: ""Interesting. Wonder why.""
[Message 85] Kai: ""Maybe that's how the killer got in.""
[Message 86] Lena: ""Possible. This whole thing is making me so anxious.""
[Message 87] Anya: ""Me too. Let's try to stay positive. They'll figure it out.""
[Message 88] Kai: ""Hope so. This city needs a win.""
[Message 89] Anya: ""Hey, I just remembered something. Last week, I saw Lena buying a bunch of sharp knives at that kitchen store. Didn't think anything of it then...""
[Message 90] Lena: ""What?! Anya, what are you implying?""
[Message 91] Kai: ""Woah, that's...not good timing, Lena.""
[Message 92] Lena: ""I cook! I like to cook! Is that a crime now? I needed new knives!""
[Message 93] Anya: ""Just saying it's a little weird considering...""
[Message 94] Lena: ""This is insane. You're turning on me?""
[Message 95] Kai: ""Look, let's all calm down. This is getting out of hand.""
[Message 96] Anya: ""I'm calm. Just pointing out facts.""
[Message 97] Lena: ""I'm leaving this conversation. I can't believe you guys.""
[Message 98] Lena: ""If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened""
[Message 99] Lena: ""Anya, I swear on my life, I had nothing to do with this. You know I'm not violent.""
[Message 100] Anya: ""Then why so defensive? It just looks bad.""
[Message 101] Kai: ""Guys, seriously. Stop. We're all stressed. Accusations aren't helping.""
[Message 102] Anya: ""Fine. But I'm not forgetting this.""
[Message 103] Kai: ""Let's just...drop it. Anyone want to grab coffee later? Neutral ground?""
[Message 104] Anya: ""Maybe. I need to think.""
[Message 105] Lena: ""I don't think I can face either of you right now.""
[Message 106] Kai: ""Okay. Well, the offer's there.""
[Message 107] Anya: ""Hey, Kai, did you ever find out who that was arguing with outside the gallery?""
[Message 108] Kai: ""Nah, never saw them again. It was probably nothing, some business squabble. I am aware that the police will ask the same.""
[Message 109] Anya: ""Maybe. Or maybe it was related to David's case.""
[Message 110] Kai: ""Could be. This whole thing is a mess.""
[Message 111] Lena: ""You think they'll ever find the killer?""
[Message 112] Anya: ""They have to. For Sarah and David.""
[Message 113] Kai: ""Yeah, they deserve justice.""

[Message 2] Liam: ""Morning, Quinn! That's a beaut. I'm alright, thanks. A bit tired, actually. Parent-teacher meeting last night ran late.""
[Message 3] Quinn: ""Oh, parent-teacher meetings. Been there, done that! What was the topic of discussion?""
[Message 4] Liam: ""Mostly math scores. Little Timmy's struggling a bit, unfortunately.""
[Message 5] Quinn: ""Ah, math. The bane of many a student's existence! Remember trying to help my niece with algebra? Disaster.""
[Message 6] Liam: ""Haha, I can imagine. I'm trying to find some good online resources for him. Any suggestions?""
[Message 7] Quinn: ""I'm afraid not. My expertise lies more in marketing these days. Speaking of, did you see the new ad campaign for this dealership?""
[Message 8] Liam: ""I did see a billboard, something about 'Drive Your Dreams'? Clever, I thought.""
[Message 9] Quinn: ""That's the one! Anyway, back to Timmy... Maybe try Khan Academy? I've heard good things.""
[Message 10] Liam: ""Khan Academy, right. Thanks, I'll check it out. So, downsizing, huh? What kind of car are you thinking of getting?""
[Message 11] Quinn: ""Something smaller, more fuel-efficient. And easy to park. This Anchorage traffic is getting ridiculous.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Tell me about it! I swear it gets worse every year. Makes me miss my bicycle sometimes.""
[Message 13] Quinn: ""A bicycle in this weather? You're braver than I am! Actually, my dog, Buster, would love that. He needs more exercise.""
[Message 14] Liam: ""Ah, Buster! How's the little fella?""
[Message 15] Quinn: ""He's doing great! Full of energy, as always. Loves chasing squirrels in the park.""
[Message 16] Liam: ""What breed is he?""
[Message 17] Quinn: ""He's a Jack Russell Terrier mix. A bundle of energy in a small package.""
[Message 18] Liam: ""I've always been a fan of Golden Retrievers. Such gentle giants.""
[Message 19] Quinn: ""They are lovely dogs! My neighbor has one, always friendly and wagging its tail.""
[Message 20] Liam: ""We had one when I was a kid, named Goldie, naturally. Best dog ever.""
[Message 21] Quinn: ""Dogs really are the best companions. So loyal and always happy to see you.""
[Message 22] Liam: ""Absolutely. Speaking of loyal, are you sticking with that one dealership for your new car?""
[Message 23] Quinn: ""Probably. They've always given me a good deal. And the service is excellent.""
[Message 24] Liam: ""Good to know. I might need a new car in a year or two myself.""
[Message 25] Quinn: ""Well, I can put you in touch with my sales rep. He's a good guy.""
[Message 26] Liam: ""I appreciate that, Quinn. I'll keep it in mind. What's Buster been eating these days?""
[Message 27] Quinn: ""Oh, the usual. High-quality kibble, with the occasional treat. He's quite spoiled.""
[Message 28] Liam: ""As he should be! Does he like those dental chews?""
[Message 29] Quinn: ""He loves them! They're the only way I can brush his teeth without a struggle.""
[Message 30] Liam: ""Smart dog. My cat, Whiskers, hates anything resembling a toothbrush.""
[Message 31] Quinn: ""A cat, huh? I've always been more of a dog person, but I appreciate a good feline companion.""
[Message 32] Liam: ""Whiskers is a character. Very independent, but she does love a good cuddle session.""
[Message 33] Quinn: ""I can imagine. They're so soft and fluffy.""
[Message 34] Liam: ""She sheds like crazy though! I'm constantly vacuuming.""
[Message 35] Quinn: ""Ah, the joys of pet ownership! Worth it, though, right?""
[Message 36] Liam: ""Absolutely. They bring so much joy to our lives.""
[Message 37] Quinn: ""Couldn't agree more. Buster definitely keeps me active.""
[Message 38] Liam: ""Active is good! I need to find a new hobby. I've been thinking about getting back into hiking.""
[Message 39] Quinn: ""Hiking in Alaska? Now that's an adventure! Just watch out for the bears.""
[Message 40] Liam: ""Haha, yes, bear safety is paramount. I'd probably stick to well-traveled trails at first.""
[Message 41] Quinn: ""Smart move. Maybe Buster could be your hiking buddy!""
[Message 42] Liam: ""He'd probably love that! A little too energetic, maybe.""
[Message 43] Quinn: ""He'd keep you on your toes! So, any luck with those math resources yet?""
[Message 44] Liam: ""Haven't had a chance to look yet, to be honest. I'll do some research later today.""
[Message 45] Quinn: ""Good luck! Maybe ask the teacher for some recommendations too.""
[Message 46] Liam: ""That's a good idea. I'll send her an email. By the way, have you ever tried that new coffee shop downtown?""
[Message 47] Quinn: ""The one on 5th Avenue? I haven't, but I've heard good things. Is it worth the hype?""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Definitely! Their lattes are amazing. And they have some really good pastries.""
[Message 49] Quinn: ""Sounds tempting! Maybe I'll check it out this weekend.""
[Message 50] Liam: ""You should! What's Buster's favorite toy?""
[Message 51] Quinn: ""A squeaky hedgehog. He carries it everywhere with him.""
[Message 52] Liam: ""That's adorable! Whiskers loves chasing laser pointers. So predictable.""
[Message 53] Quinn: ""Classic cat behavior! They're so easily amused.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""True. So, any particular model you're eyeing for your new car?""
[Message 55] Quinn: ""I'm thinking a Subaru Crosstrek. Good gas mileage and all-wheel drive is a must in Anchorage.""
[Message 56] Liam: ""A solid choice! Reliable cars.""
[Message 57] Quinn: ""That's what I've heard. I'm going to take one for a test drive later this week.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Good luck with that! Let me know how it goes.""
[Message 59] Quinn: ""Will do! How's your back holding up these days? All that physical therapy must take a toll.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""It's alright. Some days are better than others. I try to stay active myself, which helps.""
[Message 61] Quinn: ""That's important! You've got to take care of yourself.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""Easier said than done sometimes. I've been thinking about trying yoga.""
[Message 63] Quinn: ""Yoga is great! Very relaxing and good for flexibility.""
[Message 64] Liam: ""Exactly! I just need to find a class that fits my schedule.""
[Message 65] Quinn: ""There are tons of studios in Anchorage. I'm sure you'll find one that works.""
[Message 66] Liam: ""I hope so. Well, I should probably get going. Got a patient waiting.""
[Message 67] Quinn: ""Alright, Liam. It was good chatting with you.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""You too, Quinn! Say hi to Buster for me!""
[Message 69] Quinn: ""I will! Have a great day.""
[Message 70] Liam: ""Thanks, you too!""
[Message 71] Quinn: ""Now, back to deciding if red is REALLY the right color...""
[Message 72] Quinn: ""Maybe something more understated. Like gray...""
[Message 73] Quinn: ""Nah, too boring. Red it is! Buster loves bright colors anyway.""
[Message 74] Quinn: ""I wonder if they have any dog-friendly features in these new cars...""
[Message 75] Quinn: ""Probably not. Just have to make do with a seat cover.""
[Message 76] Quinn: ""Speaking of seat covers, I need to order a new one. Buster's been shedding like crazy lately.""
[Message 77] Quinn: ""Maybe a waterproof one this time. Just in case.""
[Message 78] Quinn: ""Okay, enough about seat covers. Focus, Quinn, focus! Car time!""
[Message 79] Quinn: ""I should probably call my sales rep and schedule that test drive.""
[Message 80] Quinn: ""The sooner the better. I want to get this car before the snow starts.""
[Message 81] Quinn: ""Ugh, snow. I'm not looking forward to another Anchorage winter.""
[Message 82] Quinn: ""But at least I'll have a new car to drive in it!""
[Message 83] Quinn: ""A shiny red new car! That'll brighten things up.""
[Message 84] Quinn: ""And Buster will love going for rides. He loves sticking his head out the window.""
[Message 85] Quinn: ""Okay, calling the sales rep now. Wish me luck!""
[Message 86] Quinn: ""Hopefully he can get me in for a test drive this week.""
[Message 87] Quinn: ""If not, I'll just have to be patient. Which is not my forte.""

[Message 4] Sasha: Jayden? As in, the Corrections Officer Jayden? I knew him!
[Message 5] Kai: And Alex, the social worker.
[Message 6] Lila: I knew Alex. Worked with them a few times. This is insane.
[Message 7] River: I saw Jayden yesterday. He seemed fine. Maybe a little withdrawn, but nothing out of the ordinary.
[Message 8] Sasha: He always was a bit of a loner.
[Message 9] Kai: This city is getting scarier every day.
[Message 10] Lila: Agreed. Did they say anything about who did it?
[Message 11] River: No names yet, just that they're investigating.

[Message 17] Kai: I was at work. Nothing out of the ordinary.
[Message 18] Lila: Me too. Just another day at the office.
[Message 19] River: Okay. Just checking.
[Message 20] Sasha: Why River? What’s up?
[Message 21] River: Just… being thorough.
[Message 22] Kai: So, anyone have any theories?
[Message 23] Lila: It could be anyone. A random act of violence?
[Message 24] Sasha: Maybe. Or someone they knew.
[Message 25] River: That's what I'm afraid of.
[Message 26] Kai: Remember how Jayden fired that new girl a few weeks ago? Maybe she snapped.
[Message 27] Lila: You think so? That's a bit of a stretch, Kai.
[Message 28] Sasha: It's possible. People do crazy things.
[Message 29] River: Let's not jump to conclusions. The police will figure it out.
[Message 30] Kai: True. But it's hard not to speculate.
[Message 31] Lila: I have to agree, my mind keeps running.
[Message 32] Sasha: Anyone wants to meet up later for coffee? I need to get out of the house.
[Message 33] Kai: I’m down.
[Message 34] River: Can't. Got a thing.
[Message 35] Lila: I can. Where and when?
[Message 36] Sasha: The usual place at 6?
[Message 37] Lila: Sounds good.
[Message 38] Kai: Cool, see you both there.

[Message 42] Kai: Later.
[Message 43] Lila: Bye.
[Message 44] Sasha: Bye all.

[Message 46] Kai: So, coffee was good. But I'm still thinking about Jayden and Alex.
[Message 47] Lila: Me too. Keeps replaying in my head.
[Message 48] Sasha: It’s horrible. Did River say what ""thing"" they had to do?
[Message 49] Kai: No clue. Just said they were busy.
[Message 50] Lila: Odd. They seemed really preoccupied earlier.
[Message 51] Sasha: I noticed that too. Almost like they knew something.
[Message 52] Kai: Don't go there, Sasha.
[Message 53] Lila: Yeah, let's not start accusing people.
[Message 54] Sasha: I'm not accusing anyone! Just saying, they seemed… off.
[Message 55] Kai: Maybe they were just upset about what happened.
[Message 56] Lila: That's probably it.
[Message 57] Sasha: Could be. I'm just saying, I'm not ruling anything out.
[Message 58] Kai: You're exhausting, you know that?
[Message 59] Lila: Tell me about it.
[Message 60] Sasha: Sorry, I just want justice for Jayden and Alex.
[Message 61] Kai: We all do.
[Message 62] Lila: Agreed.
[Message 63] River: (To self) Justice comes at a price. A price you wouldn't understand. I will be blamed, I am sure.
[Message 64] Kai: I heard Alex was having some problems at work.
[Message 65] Lila: Really? What kind of problems?
[Message 66] Kai: Something about a client threatening them.
[Message 67] Sasha: Wow. That's terrifying.
[Message 68] River: See? Lots of possible angles.
[Message 69] Lila: Yeah, but that doesn't make it any less scary.
[Message 70] Kai: Exactly. People are messed up.
[Message 71] Sasha: Did Alex ever mention who was threatening them?
[Message 72] Lila: Not to me. I just knew they were stressed.
[Message 73] Kai: Maybe that's who did it. The client.
[Message 74] River: Could be. Or maybe it's completely unrelated.
[Message 75] Sasha: We’re going in circles here.
[Message 76] Kai: I think we should wait for the police to tell us something.
[Message 77] Lila: Agreed. Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
[Message 78] Sasha: Fine. But I'm still going to be suspicious.
[Message 79] Kai: That's your prerogative.
[Message 80] Lila: Let's just try to stay calm.
[Message 81] River: Easier said than done.
[Message 82] Kai: I'm going to try to get some sleep. This is giving me a headache.
[Message 83] Lila: Me too. Goodnight, guys.
[Message 84] Sasha: Night.
[Message 85] River: Goodnight.
[Message 86] Kai: (Next Day) Any news?
[Message 87] Lila: Nothing yet. Still investigating.
[Message 88] Sasha: I saw a cop car outside River's apartment earlier.
[Message 89] Kai: What? Seriously?
[Message 90] Lila: Are you sure, Sasha?
[Message 91] Sasha: Positive. Parked right out front.
[Message 92] Kai: Maybe they were just in the neighborhood?
[Message 93] Lila: Or maybe they wanted to talk to River?
[Message 94] Sasha: That's what I'm thinking.
[Message 95] Kai: OMG. This is getting crazy.
[Message 96] Lila: Sasha, you need to be careful making accusations like that.
[Message 97] Sasha: I’m not accusing! I’m reporting what I saw.
[Message 98] River: (To self) Sasha saw the cop car? Damn it.
[Message 99] Kai: River, are you there?
[Message 100] Lila: River, everything okay?
[Message 101] Sasha: River?
[Message 102] River: Yeah, I'm here. Sorry, was in the shower.
[Message 103] Kai: Sasha said she saw a cop car outside your apartment.
[Message 104] Lila: Is everything alright?
[Message 105] River: Oh, that. Yeah, they just asked me some questions about Jayden.
[Message 106] Kai: About what?
[Message 107] Lila: What did they want to know?
[Message 108] River: Just general stuff. When I last saw him, if I knew anything.
[Message 109] Sasha: Did they say why they were asking you specifically?
[Message 110] River: No, they didn't. Just routine, I guess.
[Message 111] Kai: That's weird.
[Message 112] Lila: Very weird.
[Message 113] Sasha: Something's not adding up.
[Message 114] River: Look, I told them everything I knew. Which wasn't much.
[Message 115] Kai: Okay. If you say so.
[Message 116] Lila: Yeah, well…
[Message 117] Sasha: Still not buying it.
[Message 118] River: Seriously, guys? You think I had something to do with this?
[Message 119] Kai: Nobody said that, River.
[Message 120] Lila: Exactly. We're just concerned.
[Message 121] Sasha: But you have to admit, it looks suspicious.
[Message 122] River: Suspicious how? I barely knew Jayden!
[Message 123] Kai: Okay, let's all just take a breath.
[Message 124] Lila: Agreed. This is getting out of hand.
[Message 125] Sasha: Fine. I'll drop it. For now.
[Message 126] River: Thank you.
[Message 127] Kai: So, anything else new?
[Message 128] Lila: Not that I've heard.
[Message 129] Sasha: My cousin works at the courthouse. I'll see if she knows anything.
[Message 130] Kai: Be careful, Sasha. You don't want to get involved.
[Message 131] Lila: Yeah, that could be dangerous.
[Message 132] Sasha: I can handle myself.
[Message 133] River: Please don't do anything stupid.
[Message 134] Kai: Seriously, Sasha. Just let the police do their job.
[Message 135] Lila: Agreed.
[Message 136] Sasha: Whatever. I'm just trying to help.
[Message 137] River: ""Help""? Or make things worse?
[Message 138] Kai: Guys, stop it!
[Message 139] Lila: Seriously, enough!
[Message 140] Sasha: Fine. I'm done.
[Message 141] River: Good.
[Message 142] Kai: This is exactly what I was afraid of.
[Message 143] Lila: Me too. We need to stay calm and let the authorities handle it.
[Message 144] Sasha: Okay, okay. I get it.
[Message 145] River: (To Self) They’re closer than they think. Alex knew something about my dealings, and Jayden knew about Alex. That's what this was about. I knew I had to take care of it; I knew what would happen if I didn't. I acted purposefully.
[Message 146] Kai: Anyone else having trouble sleeping?
[Message 147] Lila: Horrible. Every time I close my eyes.
[Message 148] Sasha: I keep seeing Jayden's face.
[Message 149] River: Yeah, it's rough.
[Message 150] Kai: It's just so senseless.
[Message 151] Lila: Agreed. Why would anyone do this?
[Message 152] Sasha: I wish I knew.
[Message 153] River: Maybe we'll never know.
[Message 154] Kai: I hope that's not true.
[Message 155] Lila: Me too.
[Message 156] Sasha: Well, I'm going to try to get some rest.
[Message 157] Kai: Goodnight.
[Message 158] Lila: Night.
[Message 159] River: (To Self) Sasha’s silence is deafening. Almost worse than her accusations.
[Message 160] Kai: Has anyone heard from River recently?
[Message 161] Lila: No, not since last night.
[Message 162] Sasha: Me neither. That's odd.
[Message 163] Kai: I'm starting to worry.
[Message 164] Lila: Maybe they just turned off their phone?
[Message 165] Sasha: Maybe. Or maybe the police took them in for questioning.
[Message 166] Kai: Don't say that, Sasha!
[Message 167] Lila: Yeah, let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 168] Sasha: Just a thought. I am starting to wonder if River had anything to do with it.
[Message 169] Kai: River was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 170] Lila: I was not aware of this.
[Message 171] Sasha: The person who fired Jayden may have been mad enough to hire a hitman.
[Message 172] Kai: Lets just calm down and wait for some news.
[Message 173] Lila: Agreed
[Message 174] Sasha: Fine.
[Message 175] River: (To Self) Almost there. Almost free.
[Message 176] Kai: News Alert - River has been arrested in connection with the deaths of Jayden and Alex.
[Message 177] Lila: OMG!
[Message 178] Sasha: I KNEW IT!
[Message 179] Kai: So… it was him.
[Message 180] Lila: I guess so. This is just… unbelievable.",1,

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, Chloe. Crazy day. You wouldn't believe it.
[Message 3] Chloe: What happened? Everything alright with you?
[Message 4] Liam: I'm fine. It's… it's Ms. Evelyn Reed. She's… gone.
[Message 5] Chloe: Evelyn? What do you mean 'gone'? What happened to the 1.  Law Enforcement Officer?
[Message 6] Liam: I can't really talk about it. Just… tragic accident.
[Message 7] Chloe: Accident? The police were everywhere! That doesn’t sound like an accident.
[Message 8] Liam: Look, I gotta go. Meetings. It’s hectic.
[Message 9] Chloe: Liam, wait! Did you see anything?
[Message 10] Liam: I saw everyone in shock. That's all. Talk later.
[Message 11] Sarah: Chloe, have you heard anything about what happened to Evelyn?
[Message 12] Chloe: Just bits and pieces from Liam. Sounds bad. Did you know her well?
[Message 13] Sarah: We chatted sometimes. She was… direct. Knew how to get things done.
[Message 14] Chloe: Direct is an understatement. Some people didn't like how she handled things. Remember that argument with Dana last month?
[Message 15] Sarah: Vaguely. Dana gets heated easily. What a horrible day.
[Message 16] Chloe: Agreed. I hope they figure out what happened quickly.
[Message 17] Dana: Hey Sarah, you at home? I need to vent.
[Message 18] Sarah: Yeah, come over. Everyone's shaken up about Evelyn.
[Message 19] Dana: I know, right? I can't believe it. About Evelyn.
[Message 20] Liam: Hey Chloe, sorry I bailed earlier. Things are insane here.
[Message 21] Chloe: It's okay. I understand. Has anyone mentioned anything about a political assassination?
[Message 22] Liam: Political what now? Chloe, what are you talking about? Where are you getting that from?
[Message 23] Chloe: Just something I read. Forget it.
[Message 24] Liam: Good. Because that's crazy. It's just a tragedy.
[Message 25] Sarah: Dana's here. We're talking about everything. It's rough.
[Message 26] Chloe: Is Dana okay? She seemed really stressed lately.
[Message 27] Sarah: She's upset, but holding it together. Says she saw Evelyn this morning.
[Message 28] Dana: Saw her yelling at Carl, actually. Right before I left for my meeting.
[Message 29] Sarah: What were they arguing about?
[Message 30] Dana: No idea. Carl looked furious. I thought he was going to hit her.
[Message 31] Chloe: Carl? Really? He always seemed so mild-mannered.
[Message 32] Liam: Why are you asking so many questions? Are you a cop now?
[Message 33] Chloe: Just trying to understand what happened. You’re acting weird, Liam.
[Message 34] Liam: I'm just stressed. Lay off.
[Message 35] Sarah: Carl had a motive, everyone knew Evelyn was about to expose him for stealing office supplies. If he hadn't stolen, none of this would have happened,
[Message 36] Dana: I heard Carl was looking up how to make Hitting with a golf club online yesterday too! That’s so creepy.
[Message 37] Chloe: Seriously? That’s insane. He could be going away for a long time for this
[Message 38] Liam: Look, I gotta go. I saw him leave the building at Late Morning. That is all I know.
[Message 39] Chloe: Ok. Be careful.
[Message 40] Sarah: What do you think, Chloe? Could it be Carl?
[Message 41] Chloe: It sounds suspicious. But maybe too obvious?
[Message 42] Dana: True. Maybe someone else intended to do it?
[Message 43] Sarah: Like who?
[Message 44] Dana: I don't know! It's all crazy. I'm going home, I can't take it anymore.
[Message 45] Sarah: Okay, get some rest. We'll talk tomorrow.
[Message 46] Chloe: I heard Ms. Evelyn Reed was about to release a report on potential corruption. Anyone know anything about that?
[Message 47] Liam: Corruption? Nope. Never heard anything. You and your crazy theories.
[Message 48] Chloe: Just wondering.
[Message 49] Sarah: Corruption, huh? That explains why she was so hated.
[Message 50] Dana: Evelyn always hated 1.  Law Enforcement Officer. Maybe someone got sick of her.
[Message 51] Chloe: Maybe. It's all so messed up.
[Message 52] Liam: I'm off the grid for a bit. Need to clear my head.
[Message 53] Chloe: Okay. Be safe.
[Message 54] Sarah: Do you think Liam knows something he's not telling us?
[Message 55] Chloe: He's acting weird. I'm not sure what to think.
[Message 56] Dana: Who cares! Evelyn is gone. It's so bad.
[Message 57] Sarah: I know, it's awful.

[Message 5] Omar: Tunnel? Seriously? Was it an accident?

[Message 6] Kai: Cops are calling it suspicious. Someone pushed him, apparently. Late Evening.

[Message 7] Liam: Pushed? From the top? Who would do that? Judge Thompson was a legend.

[Message 8] Maya: He wasn't always liked. He was a pretty cynical guy, you know?

[Message 9] Omar: True. He made some enemies during his career. Remember the Miller case?

[Message 10] Kai: Guys, let's not speculate. Someone lost their life.

[Message 11] Liam: Right, sorry. Still, crazy stuff. Hope they catch who did it.

[Message 12] Maya: Me too. I was at the Tunnel yesterday afternoon, taking photos. Scary to think it happened there.

[Message 13] Omar: I saw River near the Tunnel yesterday Evening. Around 11 PM.

[Message 14] Kai: River? What were they doing there so late?

[Message 15] Omar: Don't know. Just saw them walking away. Seemed like they were rushing.

[Message 16] Liam: River? The religious extremist River? What would they want with Judge Thompson?

[Message 17] Maya: Maybe nothing. It's a public place.

[Message 18] Kai: I don't know, River has always been intense. Remember that time they wanted to silence that journalist?

[Message 19] Omar: Yeah, River is always talking about justice and divine retribution. I heard them say, Judge Thompson was obstructing the truth.

[Message 20] Liam: What? Did you hear them threaten the judge, or anything?

[Message 21] Omar: No, nothing like that. Just venting, I guess. But River did want to get rid of him, in his own way.

[Message 28] Liam: Did anyone hear about Judge's plan to expose corruption in the city? It's been silenced with him.

[Message 29] Omar: Maybe... or maybe it's just a coincidence, like you said.

[Message 30] River: Guys, this is terrible. I can't believe Judge Thompson is gone. I know some people will say I intended to harm him, but that's ridiculous. I'm cooperating fully with the police. Hope they find justice, and the culprit goes away for a long time for this.",1,

[Message 2] Jordan: Hey Alex! Yeah, I'm at Front Porch already. Where are you right now?
[Message 3] Sam: Hi Alex and Jordan! I'm almost there too.
[Message 4] Alex: I think I'm near... Lombard Street? It's all looking the same in the dark.
[Message 5] Jordan: Okay, Lombard is a bit out of the way. Head south towards Chestnut. You should see Fillmore Street, Front Porch is right there.
[Message 6] Sam: Just follow Jordan's directions, Alex. He knows the area.
[Message 7] Alex: Chestnut... got it. Thanks, Jordan! Appreciate the help.
[Message 8] Jordan: No problem! See you in a bit. We saved you a spot.
[Message 9] Sam: Yeah, we're by the window!
[Message 10] Alex: Awesome! I'll be there in like 10 minutes, hopefully.
[Message 11] Jordan: Cool. So, Sam, how was your day?
[Message 12] Sam: Pretty chill actually. Just spent most of it reading. Found a new author I really like.
[Message 13] Jordan: Oh, who? I'm always looking for book recommendations.
[Message 14] Sam: Octavia Butler. Have you heard of her?
[Message 15] Jordan: Vaguely. I'm more into graphic novels lately, but I'm open to suggestions.
[Message 16] Sam: You should definitely check her out. Kind of sci-fi, kind of sociological. Really thought-provoking.
[Message 17] Jordan: I will! Thanks!
[Message 18] Alex: Okay, I'm on Chestnut. This is taking longer than I thought.
[Message 19] Jordan: You're almost there! Keep going south on Chestnut until you hit Fillmore.
[Message 20] Sam: Just a few more blocks, Alex!
[Message 21] Alex: Fillmore... got it. Almost there.
[Message 22] Jordan: So, Sam, speaking of books, have you ever considered writing your own?
[Message 23] Sam: Haha, no way! I'm a reader, not a writer. Too much pressure.
[Message 24] Jordan: You never know! You clearly have good taste.
[Message 25] Sam: Maybe someday, but for now, I'm happy just enjoying other people's stories.
[Message 26] Alex: Finally on Fillmore! Which way do I go?
[Message 27] Jordan: You should see Front Porch right there! Look for the big porch, haha.
[Message 28] Sam: It's on the east side of Fillmore, Alex.
[Message 29] Alex: Found it! You guys are lifesavers. Be there in 2.
[Message 30] Jordan: Awesome!
[Message 31] Sam: Great!
[Message 32] Jordan: So, random thought... Do you guys think I should get bangs again?
[Message 33] Sam: Ooh, bangs! That's a big decision.
[Message 34] Alex: (Arriving!) Hey guys! So glad to be here!
[Message 35] Sam: Hey Alex!
[Message 36] Jordan: Hey! Glad you made it!
[Message 37] Alex: Thanks again for the directions! Seriously, I was lost.
[Message 38] Jordan: No worries! So, bangs... yes or no?
[Message 39] Sam: It depends! What kind of bangs are you thinking? Wispy? Blunt?
[Message 40] Jordan: Maybe wispy? I'm trying to decide if it would suit my face shape.
[Message 41] Alex: I think you could totally rock wispy bangs! You've got the cheekbones for it.
[Message 42] Sam: Hmmm, I'm not sure. Maybe try a clip-in fringe first to see how you like it?
[Message 43] Jordan: That's a good idea, Sam! I didn't think of that.
[Message 44] Alex: Yeah, definitely try before you commit.
[Message 45] Jordan: Okay, clip-in bangs it is! Thanks for the advice, you two.
[Message 46] Sam: No problem! Always happy to offer my unsolicited opinions.
[Message 47] Alex: Same here! Now, what are we drinking?
[Message 48] Jordan: I'm having a glass of wine. You want one?
[Message 49] Alex: Sure! What kind?
[Message 50] Jordan: Cabernet Sauvignon.
[Message 51] Alex: Sounds good! I'll take one of those.
[Message 52] Sam: I'm good with water for now, thanks.
[Message 53] Jordan: Alright, I'll flag down the server.
[Message 54] Alex: So, Sam, what were you reading today? You mentioned Octavia Butler?
[Message 55] Sam: Yeah! I started ""Kindred."" It's amazing.
[Message 56] Alex: What's it about?
[Message 57] Sam: It's about a modern woman who keeps getting transported back in time to a plantation in the antebellum South.
[Message 58] Alex: Whoa, intense.
[Message 59] Jordan: Sounds heavy.
[Message 60] Sam: It is, but it's also really powerful and thought-provoking.
[Message 61] Alex: I might have to check that out. I need something to read on my commute.
[Message 62] Jordan: Definitely. I'm always looking for a good distraction on the bus.
[Message 63] Sam: Highly recommend it. Just be prepared for some emotional rollercoaster.
[Message 64] Alex: Noted. Thanks for the warning!
[Message 65] Jordan: So, Alex, how's the security guard gig going? Anything exciting happen lately?
[Message 66] Alex: Nah, nothing too exciting. Mostly just making sure everything stays quiet. You know, the usual.
[Message 67] Sam: I bet you see some interesting characters though.
[Message 68] Alex: Oh, definitely. You wouldn't believe the things people try to bring into the building.
[Message 69] Jordan: Haha, I can only imagine.
[Message 70] Alex: One time, someone tried to smuggle in a ferret.
[Message 71] Sam: A ferret?! Seriously?
[Message 72] Jordan: No way! That's hilarious.
[Message 73] Alex: I know, right? I had to explain that no, they couldn't bring their ferret into a corporate office.
[Message 74] Sam: I would love to have seen that.
[Message 75] Jordan: Me too! You should start a blog, Alex, ""Tales from a Security Guard.""
[Message 76] Alex: Haha, maybe I should. I've got enough material for a whole book at this point.
[Message 77] Sam: Definitely! I'd read it.
[Message 78] Jordan: Me too! You could even do illustrations.
[Message 79] Alex: I can barely draw a stick figure, Jordan. That's your domain.
[Message 80] Jordan: True! I could definitely contribute some illustrations.
[Message 81] Sam: This is getting exciting! We're basically brainstorming your next career move, Alex.
[Message 82] Alex: Haha, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'm happy with my security gig for now.
[Message 83] Jordan: But the blog idea is still on the table, right?
[Message 84] Alex: Maybe. I'll think about it.
[Message 85] Sam: Just plant the seed!
[Message 86] Jordan: Exactly!
[Message 87] Alex: Alright, alright. I'll mull it over. So, Jordan, how's physical therapy going?
[Message 88] Jordan: Pretty good! It's rewarding helping people recover. But also exhausting.
[Message 89] Sam: I can imagine. It's a very hands-on job, right?
[Message 90] Jordan: Oh yeah. Lots of lifting and bending. I need physical therapy for my physical therapy!
[Message 91] Alex: Haha, that's ironic.
[Message 92] Sam: Maybe you should trade services with another physical therapist.
[Message 93] Jordan: That's actually not a bad idea! I might look into that. Thanks, Sam!
[Message 94] Alex: We're full of brilliant ideas tonight!
[Message 95] Sam: Just trying to be helpful! Now, about those bangs... (kidding!",0,

[Message 2] Maya: Hey Liam, yeah, shaken up. Two people… it's awful. You knew Dana, right?

[Message 3] Liam: Yeah, Dana was my taxi driver last week. Crazy. What about you, know anyone?

[Message 4] Maya: I knew the manager from cemetery. Small world. Anyway, are you free for that coffee tomorrow?

[Message 5] Liam: Yeah, coffee sounds good. Need a distraction. This whole thing is messed up.

[Message 6] Sarah: Hey guys, heard the news. So horrible! Poor Dana...

[Message 7] Maya: Sarah, you doing okay? You lived closer to the cemetery, didn’t you?

[Message 8] Sarah: I did. Heard sirens late at night but didn't think much of it. Now I'm regretting not calling it in. 😔

[Message 9] Liam: You couldn't have known, Sarah. Don't blame yourself. It was at Dusk, hard to see anything.

[Message 10] Sarah: Still… what if I could have helped?

[Message 11] Maya: There’s no way you could have known, Sarah.

[Message 12] Liam: Exactly, Maya's right. What are you doing tonight?

[Message 13] Sarah: Staying in, watching a movie. Need to take my mind off things.

[Message 14] Liam: Good idea. Something light, comedy maybe?

[Message 15] Sarah: Yeah, definitely something funny.

[Message 16] Maya: Just saw the news report, they are saying it was Arson by setting a fire.

[Message 17] Liam: Arson by setting a fire?! That’s insane.

[Message 18] Sarah: Oh my god... that's even worse.

[Message 19] Maya: I know, right? Makes it so much more… deliberate. I'm trying to remember, did anyone have a grudge against cemetery?

[Message 20] Liam: Not that I know of. Everyone seemed to like the manager.

[Message 21] Sarah: Dana, on the other hand, was always complaining about something.

[Message 22] Maya: Right. She was cynical, always saying the world was against her.

[Message 23] Liam: Yeah, Dana always seemed stressed. I asked her to drive faster, she looked at me and said I should stop asking her to do that, she will do at her own pace.

[Message 24] Sarah: I remember seeing her argue with someone near the coffee shop downtown last week.

[Message 25] Maya: Who was she arguing with, Sarah?

[Message 26] Sarah: Didn't get a good look, just saw two people yelling.

[Message 27] Liam: Crap, wish you'd gotten more info.

[Message 28] Maya: Maybe it's nothing. People argue all the time. I was buying Arson by setting a fire last week at the store, I hope I am not under investigation now.

[Message 29] Liam: Arson by setting a fire?! Why did you buy that?

[Message 30] Sarah: Maya, that is suspicious! Why?

[Message 31] Maya: Relax, guys. It was for a bonfire at my friend's place next month.

[Message 32] Liam: Oh. Okay. Still, maybe don’t mention that to the police.

[Message 33] Sarah: Good advice, Liam.

[Message 34] Maya: Yeah, probably smart. Thanks.

[Message 35] Liam: Anyway, back to the case… anything else stand out to anyone?

[Message 36] Sarah: I saw someone leave the building at Dusk, but I couldn't tell who it was. It was too dark.

[Message 37] Maya: Dusk is the worst time. Not quite day, not quite night.

[Message 38] Liam: That sucks, Sarah. It could've been helpful.

[Message 39] Sarah: I know! I feel terrible.

[Message 40] Maya: Dont beat yourself up. It’s not your fault. I know this is weird, but has anyone been contacted by the police yet?

[Message 41] Liam: Nope, not me.

[Message 42] Sarah: Me neither.

[Message 43] Maya: Okay, just checking. I’m going to try and get some sleep. This whole thing is giving me a headache.

[Message 44] Liam: Goodnight, Maya. Sleep well.

[Message 45] Sarah: Goodnight guys.

[Message 46] Liam: (Next day) Hey Sarah, Maya, coffee still on for tomorrow?

[Message 47] Sarah: Yeah, I'm in. Need to get out of the house.

[Message 48] Maya: I'm still good for coffee.

[Message 49] Liam: Cool. This case is going to haunt me for a while. What were those two people doing in a cemetery at Dusk anyway?

[Message 50] Sarah: Good question.

[Message 51] Maya: Maybe they were meeting someone? Or visiting a grave?

[Message 52] Liam: Visiting a grave at Dusk? Seems a bit morbid.

[Message 53] Sarah: Maybe it was something illicit? You know, like a secret rendezvous.

[Message 54] Maya: Maybe. Or maybe it was something completely innocent and they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

[Message 55] Liam: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened. The manager should have hired someone else.

[Message 56] Sarah: What do you mean, Liam?

[Message 57] Liam: Nothing. Just thinking out loud. I knew the manager had fired Dana from a client some weeks ago.

[Message 58] Maya: Oh, that's right! I forgot about that. Dana was furious when it happened.

[Message 59] Sarah: Wow, I didn't know that. That could be a motive for someone, right?

[Message 60] Liam: I don't know. Seems like a stretch.

[Message 61] Maya: Maybe Dana purposefully wanted to hurt the manager for revenge?

[Message 62] Sarah: That's dark, Maya.

[Message 63] Liam: Yeah, but it's possible. People do crazy things when they're angry.

[Message 64] Maya: True. Hope they don't get the death penalty for this.

[Message 65] Sarah: Absolutely. That's too cruel.

[Message 66] Liam: I think it’s only fair if they are punished severely.

[Message 67] Sarah: Well, Arson by setting a fire is a serious crime, so they're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 68] Maya: Definitely. Anyway, I gotta run. Talk to you guys tomorrow at coffee?

[Message 69] Liam: Yep, see you then.

[Message 70] Sarah: Bye guys.

[Message 71] (Next day, at coffee) Liam: So, anything new happen overnight?

[Message 72] Maya: Nope. Just a terrible nightmare about Cemetery.

[Message 73] Sarah: Same here. I kept seeing flames. It was awful.

[Message 74] Liam: I dreamt about Dana. She was driving me somewhere, but I couldn't see where.

[Message 75] Maya: Spooky.

[Message 76] Sarah: Very.

[Message 77] Liam: I feel like we're missing something important. Something we’re overlooking.

[Message 78] Maya: I agree. But what?

[Message 79] Sarah: Maybe we should try to piece together everything we know. All the little details.

[Message 80] Liam: Good idea. Okay, so Dana was fired, she argued with someone, and someone left the building at Dusk.

[Message 81] Maya: And I bought Arson by setting a fire for a bonfire.

[Message 82] Sarah: Maya, are you sure you didn't see anyone suspicious when you bought it?

[Message 83] Maya: No, I didn't. It was crowded.

[Message 84] Liam: The police have been asking around. Did you get a call?

[Message 85] Sarah: They called this morning. Asked me about what I saw at Dusk.

[Message 86] Maya: Seriously? They haven't called me yet.

[Message 87] Liam: Maybe they're just working their way through the list.

[Message 88] Sarah: Or maybe they already know something.

[Message 89] Maya: That's a little unnerving.

[Message 90] Liam: Let's just try to stay calm and cooperate. The truth will come out eventually. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there, that's all I am going to say.",1,

[Message 4] Quinn: I’m good, thanks River. Actually heading to the doctor after this, need some advice.
[Message 5] Alex: Doctor's appointment, Quinn? Hope everything's okay!
[Message 6] Quinn: Just a check-up, but I've been feeling a bit off. Want to pick their brain about it.
[Message 7] Jamie: Always good to get checked out. Better safe than sorry!
[Message 8] River: Absolutely. Any idea what you want to ask them specifically?
[Message 9] Quinn: I’ve been having trouble sleeping. Thought I’d ask about that.
[Message 10] Alex: Sleep is so important! I've been having weird dreams lately. Anyone else?
[Message 11] Jamie: Haha, tell me about it! Last night I dreamed I was swimming in spaghetti sauce.
[Message 12] River: Now that’s a visual! Back to Quinn, maybe try some chamomile tea before bed?
[Message 13] Quinn: Good idea, River. I'll add that to my list of questions for the doctor.
[Message 14] Alex: Maybe the doctor can recommend something stronger if the tea doesn't work.
[Message 15] Jamie: They might suggest a sleep study. Those can be helpful.
[Message 16] River: My grandpa used to swear by warm milk and honey. Old-school, but worth a shot.
[Message 17] Quinn: I'm willing to try anything at this point. Thanks, everyone!
[Message 18] Alex: No problem, Quinn! We're here to help. Say, has anyone seen the new fishing gear at Bass Pro?
[Message 19] Jamie: Ooh, shiny new gear! Tempting.
[Message 20] River: Focus, Jamie! Quinn's trying to get some sleep!
[Message 21] Jamie: Right, right. Sorry!
[Message 22] Quinn: It's okay, Jamie! I appreciate the distraction, actually.
[Message 23] Alex: Speaking of distractions, my car's been making a weird noise. River, you know cars, any ideas?
[Message 24] River: What kind of noise, Alex? Is it a clicking, a whirring…?
[Message 25] Alex: More of a rattling, I think. Mostly when I accelerate.
[Message 26] River: Could be a number of things. Loose heat shield maybe?
[Message 27] Alex: I’ll check that. Thanks, River!
[Message 28] Jamie: Okay, seriously, back to Quinn. What other symptoms are you having besides the sleep problems?
[Message 29] Quinn: Just feeling generally tired and a little irritable.
[Message 30] Alex: Maybe it's a vitamin deficiency? I started taking vitamin D and it helped a lot.
[Message 31] Jamie: Yeah, could be! Or even just stress.
[Message 32] River: Definitely bring that up with the doctor, Quinn.
[Message 33] Quinn: Will do. You guys are the best. Makes me feel better just talking about it.
[Message 34] Alex: That's what friends are for!
[Message 35] Jamie: Exactly! We're your support system.
[Message 36] River: Although, if the doctor says it's serious, we're not liable for any medical advice given here, haha.
[Message 37] Quinn: Of course, River! I know you're just being funny.

[Message 39] Jamie: Actually, I just perfected a new paella recipe!
[Message 40] River: Ooh, paella! My favorite.

[Message 42] Alex: Maybe you could make it for us sometime!
[Message 43] Jamie: I'd love to! We'll have to plan a get-together.
[Message 44] River: I'm in! Just name the date.
[Message 45] Quinn: Me too, as long as I'm feeling up to it.
[Message 46] Alex: Excellent! Let's aim for next weekend?
[Message 47] Jamie: Sounds good to me!
[Message 48] River: Works for me too.
[Message 49] Quinn: Great! I'm looking forward to it.
[Message 50] Alex: Train's here! Gotta run.
[Message 51] Jamie: Me too. See you all later!
[Message 52] River: Bye!
[Message 53] Quinn: Have a good day, guys!
[Message 54] River: Hey Quinn, remember to write down all your questions for the doctor so you don’t forget!
[Message 55] Quinn: Good call, River. I’ll do that on the train.
[Message 56] Alex: Hope the train isn’t delayed today.
[Message 57] Jamie: Right? The SunRail is usually pretty good, but you never know.
[Message 58] River: Better than driving in this traffic, that’s for sure.
[Message 59] Quinn: Absolutely. I'd rather deal with a slightly delayed train than sit in gridlock.
[Message 60] Alex: Anyone reading any good books lately? Need something new to read while fishing.
[Message 61] Jamie: I’m reading a biography of Julia Child. Fascinating!
[Message 62] River: I just finished a thriller. Couldn’t put it down!

[Message 64] Alex: Julia Child, huh? Sounds interesting, Jamie.
[Message 65] Jamie: It is! She was such a character.
[Message 66] River: Maybe you can tell us more about it at the paella party.

[Message 68] Quinn: Looking forward to it.
[Message 69] Alex: Just realized I forgot my fishing hat! Ugh.
[Message 70] Jamie: Ouch, that's a bummer.
[Message 71] River: Maybe you can find a cheap one at a gas station or something.
[Message 72] Quinn: Or just embrace the sun!
[Message 73] Alex: I'll see what I can find. Don't want to get sunburned.
[Message 74] Jamie: Speaking of sunburn, did anyone see that crazy weather report?
[Message 75] River: Yeah, supposed to be scorching this weekend.
[Message 76] Quinn: Perfect weather for painting outside, though!
[Message 77] Alex: True! You can paint the sunset, Quinn.
[Message 78] Jamie: As long as you stay hydrated!
[Message 79] River: And wear sunscreen!
[Message 80] Quinn: Always!
[Message 81] Alex: Okay, gotta focus on finding a hat. Talk later!

[Message 99] Alex: I hope so! Maybe it'll attract them.
[Message 100] Jamie: It can't hurt!
[Message 101] River: So, Quinn, how did your appointment go?
[Message 102] Quinn: It went well, actually. The doctor thinks it's mostly stress.
[Message 103] Alex: Good to hear!
[Message 104] Jamie: Relief, I bet!
[Message 105] River: What did they recommend?
[Message 106] Quinn: They suggested some relaxation techniques and maybe cutting back on caffeine.
[Message 107] Alex: Sounds like good advice.
[Message 108] Jamie: Definitely doable.
[Message 109] River: So, no crazy medical issues?
[Message 110] Quinn: Nope, thankfully. Just need to chill out a bit.
[Message 111] Alex: We can help with that at the paella party!
[Message 112] Jamie: Absolutely! Good food and good company.
[Message 113] River: Exactly! The perfect stress reliever.
[Message 114] Quinn: I'm already feeling better just thinking about it.
[Message 115] Alex: That pink hat will be there too, adding to the ambiance.
[Message 116] Jamie: Even better!
[Message 117] River: Can't wait!
[Message 118] Quinn: Me neither. Thanks again for all your support, guys.
[Message 119] Alex: Anytime, Quinn!
[Message 120] Jamie: Always here for you!
[Message 121] River: We're a team!
[Message 122] Quinn: I really appreciate that.
[Message 123] Alex: Now, who's bringing dessert to the party?
[Message 124] Jamie: I can whip up something easy and delicious! How about tiramisu?
[Message 125] Quinn: Tiramisu sounds amazing, Jamie! Perfect end to the meal.",0,

[Message 72] David: ""No! He never mentioned that specifically. He was looking up how to make Poisoning via ingestion online but I persuaded him not to.""
[Message 73] Ben: ""This is bad, David. Really bad. You knew about this, and you didn't say anything?""

300,"[Message 1] Olivia: Hey everyone! Just saw the local news - they're finally repaving Elm Street! About time.
[Message 2] Sam: Wow, really? Elm Street was a nightmare. My alignment's gonna thank them.
[Message 3] Alex: Good news indeed. I heard they're adding bike lanes too?
[Message 4] Chloe: Oh, that's fantastic! I've been wanting to bike to work more often.
[Message 5] David: Bike lanes are great. I wonder if they'll affect traffic flow much during construction.
[Message 6] Olivia: They said on the news it'll be phased construction, so hopefully not too bad.
[Message 7] Sam: Phased is good. Remember the fiasco with Maple Avenue last year?
[Message 8] Alex: Oh god, don't remind me. That detour added 20 minutes to my commute.
[Message 9] Chloe: Yeah, Maple Avenue was a disaster. Hopefully, they learned from that.
[Message 10] David: Agreed. Clear signage is key.
[Message 11] Olivia: Totally. Speaking of things going smoothly, how was everyone's week? Mine was pretty hectic at school.
[Message 12] Sam: Mine was alright. Finally finished that deck project. Now I need to stain it.
[Message 13] Alex: Nice, Sam! I'm thinking about redoing my bathroom. Any recommendations for contractors?
[Message 14] Chloe: I can recommend someone, Alex! He did a great job on my kitchen a few years back.
[Message 15] David: That's helpful, Chloe! I might need a recommendation later.
[Message 16] Olivia: Back to the Elm Street news, did they mention when they're starting?
[Message 17] Sam: I think they said next Monday.
[Message 18] Alex: Good to know. I'll have to adjust my route then.
[Message 19] Chloe: I saw something about a community meeting about the Elm Street project next week too.
[Message 20] David: That's interesting, Chloe. Where did you see that?
[Message 21] Olivia: Community meeting? That's a good idea. Gives people a chance to voice concerns.
[Message 22] Sam: Yeah, transparency is always good.
[Message 23] Alex: Definitely. I'm all for getting input from residents.
[Message 24] Chloe: I saw it on the Henderson town website. They usually post everything there.
[Message 25] David: I'll check it out. Thanks, Chloe!
[Message 26] Olivia: On a slightly different note, anyone see the art exhibit at the library?
[Message 27] Sam: Nah, haven't had time lately. Is it any good?
[Message 28] Alex: I haven't either, but I saw some pictures online. Looked interesting.
[Message 29] Chloe: I went! It was actually really cool. A lot of local artists.
[Message 30] David: Oh, I didn't realize it was local artists. I might have to check it out.
[Message 31] Olivia: It's worth a visit. Lots of different styles.
[Message 32] Sam: Maybe I'll swing by this weekend if I get the deck stained.
[Message 33] Alex: I'm thinking of taking my daughter. She's really into art.
[Message 34] Chloe: She'll probably love it. There were a few pieces that were particularly engaging for kids.
[Message 35] David: Sounds like a good family outing.
[Message 36] Olivia: So, back to work stuff... David, how's that new intern doing?
[Message 37] Sam: Yeah, how's the new blood, David?
[Message 38] Alex: Good question! Always curious about new talent coming in.
[Message 39] Chloe: Hope they're learning a lot!
[Message 40] David: He's doing well, actually. Very eager to learn. I gave him some feedback on his presentation skills the other day.
[Message 41] Olivia: Good for you, David, giving feedback is so important.
[Message 42] Sam: Yeah, constructive criticism is key.
[Message 43] Alex: Absolutely. I try to be as helpful as possible when mentoring new employees.
[Message 44] Chloe: It's great to see people investing in the next generation.
[Message 45] David: I think he appreciated it. He seemed much more confident after our chat.
[Message 46] Olivia: Confidence is half the battle.
[Message 47] Sam: True that. Especially in the financial world.
[Message 48] Alex: Confidence and accuracy, hopefully!
[Message 49] Chloe: Haha, yes, accuracy is pretty important in that field.
[Message 50] David: Definitely. I double-check everything he does at this stage.
[Message 51] Olivia: Smart move.
[Message 52] Sam: I'm curious, what kind of feedback did you give him specifically, David?
[Message 53] Alex: Yeah, what were the key points you focused on?
[Message 54] Chloe: Sharing is caring!
[Message 55] David: Mostly on structuring his presentation and making eye contact. He was a bit monotone and staring at his notes too much.
[Message 56] Olivia: Eye contact is huge. Makes a big difference.
[Message 57] Sam: Monotone is a killer. Needs to inject some energy.
[Message 58] Alex: Yeah, pacing and vocal variety are crucial.
[Message 59] Chloe: Even just smiling can make a difference!
[Message 60] David: Exactly. Little things that add up.
[Message 61] Olivia: Well, sounds like you're doing a great job mentoring him, David.
[Message 62] Sam: Agreed. Keep up the good work.
[Message 63] Alex: He's lucky to have you as a mentor.
[Message 64] Chloe: Definitely a valuable skill to pass on.
[Message 65] David: Thanks, everyone. I appreciate that. I enjoy helping people develop.
[Message 66] Olivia: Well, that's what makes you a great colleague, David.
[Message 67] Sam: Yeah, good people are hard to find.
[Message 68] Alex: Agreed. A supportive workplace is so important.
[Message 69] Chloe: Makes all the difference.
[Message 70] David: Thanks again, everyone. It's great working with all of you too.
[Message 71] Olivia: The feeling is mutual!
[Message 72] Sam: Absolutely.
[Message 73] Alex: Hear, hear!
[Message 74] Chloe: Cheers to that!
[Message 75] David: So, anyone have any fun plans for the weekend?
[Message 76] Olivia: I'm planning on going to a new exhibit at the botanical gardens.
[Message 77] Sam: I'm hoping to finish staining the deck. Maybe some camping if the weather holds up.
[Message 78] Alex: I'm taking my daughter to that art exhibit Chloe mentioned.
[Message 79] Chloe: Have fun! I hope you both enjoy it.
[Message 80] David: I'm going to try to get some photography done at the park.
[Message 81] Olivia: Botanical gardens sound lovely! Send pics!
[Message 82] Sam: Camping sounds great, enjoy nature!
[Message 83] Alex: Thanks, Chloe! My daughter is really looking forward to it.
[Message 84] Chloe: Let me know what you think!
[Message 85] David: I will definitely share some photos.
[Message 86] Olivia: Awesome!
[Message 87] Sam: Nice!
[Message 88] Alex: Great!
[Message 89] Chloe: Wonderful!
[Message 90] David: Well, I should probably get back to work.
[Message 91] Olivia: Me too. Have a great afternoon, everyone!
[Message 92] Sam: You too!
[Message 93] Alex: Take care!
[Message 94] Chloe: Bye everyone!
[Message 95] David: Bye!
[Message 96] Olivia: Oh, one last thing - anyone know a good place to get alterations done? I have a dress that needs to be taken in.
[Message 97] Sam: I think there's a place on Main Street, near the bakery. ""Seams Right,"" I think it's called.
[Message 98] Alex: Yeah, Seams Right is good. My wife uses them all the time.
[Message 99] Chloe: I've heard good things about them too.
[Message 100] David: I haven't used them personally, but I've seen their work and it looks professional.
[Message 101] Olivia: Perfect! Thanks, everyone! I'll check them out.
[Message 102] Sam: No problem!
[Message 103] Alex: You're welcome!
[Message 104] Chloe: Anytime!

[Message 2] BEN: Yeah, wild. Two people dead. What a mess.

[Message 3] CHLOE: I know! Poor souls. You know anyone who works there?

[Message 4] BEN: Nah, not really. Heard rumors, though. Bad place, some say.

[Message 5] CHLOE: Rumors? Like what?

[Message 6] BEN: Oh, you know, drugs, fights... shady stuff. Remember that guy, Darren? He used to go there all the time.

[Message 7] CHLOE: Darren? Vaguely. What's he got to do with it?

[Message 8] BEN: Nothing, probably. Just popped into my head. He’s always been a bit…off. Heard he’s into self-defense lately. Taking it pretty seriously.

[Message 9] CHLOE: Self-defense? Weird. Anyway, police will figure it out. You see that new movie yet?

[Message 10] BEN: No, is it any good?

[Message 11] CHLOE: Yeah! Total mind-bender. You should check it out.

[Message 12] BEN: Maybe. Too much on my mind these days. This whole situation is giving me the creeps.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Me too. Especially since I drive through there every morning.

[Message 14] BEN: Early Morning huh? Be careful, Chloe. Seriously.

[Message 15] CHLOE: I will. You too.

[Message 16] LIAM: Hey Ben, you free to grab a coffee later? Need to vent.

[Message 17] BEN: Hey Liam, yeah, maybe. What's up?

[Message 18] LIAM: Just…work stuff. Stressing me out. You know how it is.

[Message 19] BEN: I do. Coffee sounds good. How about 3 PM?

[Message 20] LIAM: Perfect. See you then.

[Message 21] ANNA: Hey Chloe, did you hear about Mark and Sarah?

[Message 22] CHLOE: Yeah, it’s horrible.

[Message 23] ANNA: I can't believe someone would do that. Especially to Sarah, she was such an optimistic person.

[Message 24] CHLOE: I know, right? It's terrifying.

[Message 25] ANNA: I heard Mark, the security guard, was kind of a jerk, though.

[Message 26] CHLOE: Really? How so?

[Message 27] ANNA: Just…cynical, always complaining. Apparently, Darren hated him.

[Message 28] CHLOE: Darren, really? You think he could be involved?

[Message 29] ANNA: I don't know, just saying. People snap, you know?

[Message 30] CHLOE: True. Hope they catch whoever did it.

[Message 31] ANNA: Me too. Hey, you still up for dinner Friday?

[Message 32] CHLOE: Definitely! Need a distraction.

[Message 33] BEN: Liam just left. That was…intense.

[Message 34] CHLOE: Intense how?

[Message 35] BEN: He's really struggling. Said his meds aren't working. Keeps saying the world is a simulation and he needs to ""fix it.""

[Message 36] CHLOE: Whoa. That's… concerning.

[Message 37] BEN: He was asking weird questions about the Truck Stop too. Said he was there early morning the other day.

[Message 38] CHLOE: Doing what?

[Message 39] BEN: He didn’t say. Just kept rambling. Said he saw the security guard, Mark, arguing with someone.

[Message 40] CHLOE: This is getting weirder and weirder. You think he could be involved?

[Message 41] BEN: I hope not, but… I'm worried about him.

[Message 42] CHLOE: Maybe you should talk to someone about this, Ben. The police maybe?

[Message 43] BEN: I don't know... I don't want to get him in trouble if he's just having a bad episode. He was talking about getting rid of him right before he went over there, so I am scared.

[Message 44] CHLOE: Better safe than sorry, right?

[Message 45] BEN: Maybe you're right.

[Message 46] LIAM: Thanks for the coffee, Ben. I feel a bit better.

[Message 47] BEN: Anytime, Liam. You doing okay?

[Message 48] LIAM: Yeah, much better. Just needed to vent. Don't worry about what I said earlier.

[Message 49] BEN: Okay, man. Just looking out for you.

[Message 50] LIAM: Appreciate it. Gotta run.

[Message 51] CHLOE: So, did you say anything to the police?

[Message 52] BEN: Not yet. Still thinking about it. I'm going to see him again tomorrow, maybe I can get him to open up more.

[Message 53] CHLOE: Okay, but be careful, Ben.

[Message 54] BEN: I will. I think he genuinely feels bad about it, like he knows he screwed up.

[Message 55] CHLOE: ""It""? What do you mean ""it""?

[Message 56] BEN: Nothing, nothing. Just… the situation.

[Message 57] CHLOE: Ben, you're scaring me.

[Message 58] BEN: I'm sorry. I just… I don't know what to do.

[Message 59] CHLOE: Tell the truth. To me, to the police, to someone.

[Message 60] BEN: I can’t. Not yet.

[Message 61] ANNA: Heard anything new about the Truck Stop case?

[Message 62] CHLOE: Just rumors. Ben knows Liam, who was supposedly there Early Morning.

[Message 63] ANNA: Interesting. Liam sounds…unstable.

[Message 64] CHLOE: That's what Ben said.

[Message 65] ANNA: Think Ben's involved somehow? Covering for him maybe?

[Message 66] CHLOE: I don't know. He’s acting really weird. Defensiveness really high.

[Message 67] ANNA: Maybe he was buying Stabbing with an ice pick, for Liam.

[Message 68] CHLOE: Whoa, that's a leap. But… it's possible.

[Message 69] ANNA: Everything's possible at this point.

[Message 70] CHLOE: True. Hey, gotta go. Talk later.

[Message 71] BEN: He confessed, Chloe. He said he wanted to end their suffering.

[Message 72] CHLOE: What?! He confessed to what?!

[Message 73] BEN: To… everything. He said he felt like they were trapped.

[Message 74] CHLOE: Trapped? What the hell does that even mean?

[Message 75] BEN: I don't know, Chloe! He’s not making any sense.

[Message 76] CHLOE: Did you call the police?

[Message 77] BEN: Yes, they’re on their way.

[Message 78] CHLOE: You did the right thing, Ben.

[Message 79] BEN: I hope so. I hope they don't get the death penalty for this.

[Message 80] CHLOE: Me too. This is insane.

[Message 81] BEN: He said he felt like it was his purpose. Like he was chosen to do it.

[Message 82] CHLOE: Chosen? Liam is insane!

[Message 83] BEN: I know. I just… I feel so guilty.

[Message 84] CHLOE: Guilty? Why?

[Message 85] BEN: I knew he was struggling. I should have done something sooner. I knew he hated Mark. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.

[Message 86] CHLOE: You can't blame yourself, Ben. This is not your fault.

[Message 87] BEN: Maybe… Maybe you're right.

[Message 88] CHLOE: I am. Just focus on helping the police now.

[Message 89] BEN: Okay. Thanks, Chloe.

[Message 90] CHLOE: Anytime, Ben.

[Message 91] ANNA: Any update on Ben and Liam?

[Message 92] CHLOE: Liam confessed.

[Message 93] ANNA: Wow. Just like that?

[Message 94] CHLOE: Yeah. Ben called the police.

[Message 95] ANNA: So, Ben's in the clear?

[Message 96] CHLOE: I think so. He sounded genuinely shocked.

[Message 97] ANNA: Good. This whole thing was making me sick to my stomach.

[Message 98] CHLOE: Me too. Glad it's (hopefully) over.

[Message 99] ANNA: Hope they find the Stabbing with an ice pick. I heard he was looking up how to make Stabbing with an ice pick online

[Message 6] AVA: Did they say who the victims were?
[Message 7] CHLOE: I heard one was a taxi driver, named Sarah, and the other was some security guard. Young, they said.

[Message 4] Maya: More than ready. Ready to forget about… things.
[Message 5] Liam: Forget about what, Maya?
[Message 6] Maya: Education reform, Liam. What else?
[Message 7] Chloe: Right, education. Speaking of which, did anyone finish grading those papers?
[Message 8] Noah: Nope. Still staring at them.
[Message 9] Liam: Procrastination is an art form.
[Message 10] Maya: Definitely. A very *specific* art form, sometimes.
[Message 11] Chloe: Specific? What’s so specific about it?
[Message 12] Maya: Nothing, nothing. Just… the subject matter. You know?
[Message 13] Liam: Subject matter. Fascinating.
[Message 14] Noah: Anyone else think this shade of green is a little… off?
[Message 15] Chloe: It's definitely a choice. Like some choices people made last night.
[Message 16] Liam: Choices?
[Message 17] Chloe: Yeah, you know. Life choices. What’s a good canvas size, you think?
[Message 18] Noah: I like the 16x20. Feels… manageable.
[Message 19] Maya: Manageable is good.
[Message 20] Liam: Very good.
[Message 21] Chloe: Manageable like… what? Homework?
[Message 22] Maya: Sure, Chloe. Like homework.
[Message 23] Liam: (chuckles nervously) Homework. Right.
[Message 24] Noah: Okay, landscape time. Mountains or beach?
[Message 25] Chloe: Beach! Always the beach.
[Message 26] Liam: Beaches can be… deceiving.
[Message 27] Maya: Agreed. Depends on the tides, doesn't it?
[Message 28] Chloe: Tides? What do tides have to do with anything?
[Message 29] Liam: Perspective, Chloe. It's all about perspective.
[Message 30] Noah: I'm going with mountains. Solid. Unwavering.
[Message 31] Maya: Steady. Reliable.
[Message 32] Chloe: Unlike some people.
[Message 33] Liam: I feel personally attacked.
[Message 34] Chloe: Should you?

[Message 38] Chloe: Fine. But I’m still wondering…
[Message 39] Liam: Wonder away, Chloe. Wonder away.

[Message 41] Chloe: I'm just trying to understand!
[Message 42] Liam: Some things are better left… un-understood.

[Message 44] Maya: Right. Colors. What colors are we thinking?
[Message 45] Chloe: Blue, definitely blue. For the disappointment.
[Message 46] Liam: Disappointment? That's a little harsh, don't you think?
[Message 47] Chloe: Is it?
[Message 48] Maya: I think it's… fitting.
[Message 49] Noah: Let’s stick to happy colors, okay? Yellow. Sunshine.
[Message 50] Liam: Sunshine can be blinding.
[Message 51] Maya: True. Shadows make things interesting.
[Message 52] Chloe: Ooh, dramatic.
[Message 53] Liam: I'm sensing a theme here.
[Message 54] Noah: Just paint, guys.
[Message 55] Maya: Painting. Got it.
[Message 56] Chloe: So, did ""it"" involve anyone else?
[Message 57] Liam: “It” is a pronoun, Chloe. It lacks specificity.
[Message 58] Maya: Liam…
[Message 59] Liam: What? I'm being grammatically correct.
[Message 60] Noah: Can we just not talk about… that?
[Message 61] Chloe: Fine. But I have questions. So many questions.
[Message 62] Maya: Save them for another time, maybe?
[Message 63] Liam: Maybe never.
[Message 64] Chloe: Never?
[Message 65] Maya: He's kidding. Right, Liam?
[Message 66] Liam: Depends on the definition of ""kidding.""
[Message 67] Noah: Mountains, people. Focus.
[Message 68] Chloe: Mountains are boring.

[Message 70] Liam: Or repression.
[Message 71] Chloe: Oh, here we go.
[Message 72] Noah: Can we just enjoy the art?
[Message 73] Maya: Trying, Noah. Trying.
[Message 74] Liam: Enjoyment is subjective.
[Message 75] Chloe: Like… what? Guilt?
[Message 76] Liam: Guilt is a social construct.
[Message 77] Maya: Maybe. Or maybe it’s a… consequence.
[Message 78] Chloe: Consequence of what?
[Message 79] Liam: Choices, Chloe. Remember? Life choices?
[Message 80] Noah: I need more wine.
[Message 81] Maya: Me too.

[Message 89] Chloe: Always.
[Message 90] Liam: Yeah, that's... reassuring.
[Message 91] Noah: What colors are you guys using for your mountains?
[Message 92] Maya: Earth tones. Trying to keep it natural.
[Message 93] Liam: Natural… as opposed to what?
[Message 94] Maya: As opposed to… neon pink.
[Message 95] Liam: Right. Neon pink. Of course.
[Message 96] Noah: Are you okay, Liam? You seem… tense.
[Message 97] Liam: Tense? I'm perfectly relaxed.
[Message 98] Maya: Sure you are.
[Message 99] Liam: This landscape painting is just really… engaging.
[Message 100] Noah: Engaging, huh?
[Message 101] Maya: It can be. Depending on what you’re projecting onto it.
[Message 102] Liam: Projecting? I'm just painting a mountain.
[Message 103] Noah: Okay.
[Message 104] Chloe: (returning) They were out of my favorite wine.
[Message 105] Liam: Tragic.

[Message 107] Chloe: About what?
[Message 108] Maya: Never mind.
[Message 109] Liam: Good.
[Message 110] Noah: More painting?
[Message 111] Chloe: Fine. But I'm still watching you, Liam.
[Message 112] Liam: Watching me do what, exactly?
[Message 113] Chloe: Exist.
[Message 114] Maya: Chloe…
[Message 115] Liam: Very comforting.
[Message 116] Noah: We should probably all just… go home after this.
[Message 117] Maya: Sounds like a plan.
[Message 118] Liam: A solid plan.
[Message 119] Chloe: And pretend none of this ever happened?
[Message 120] Liam: Precisely.
[Message 121] Maya: Not everything can be… erased, Chloe.
[Message 122] Chloe: I know that!
[Message 123] Liam: Then what's the problem?
[Message 124] Chloe: The problem is… never mind.
[Message 125] Noah: My mountain is starting to look like a blob.
[Message 126] Maya: Mine too.
[Message 127] Liam: Art is subjective, remember?
[Message 128] Chloe: Everything is subjective. Except maybe… evidence.
[Message 129] Liam: Evidence?
[Message 130] Maya: Jesus, Chloe.
[Message 131] Liam: Don't bring religion into this.
[Message 132] Noah: Guys… stop.
[Message 133] Chloe: I’m just saying…
[Message 134] Liam: Saying what? Out with it.

[Message 6] Maya: ""I know, right? Makes you think.""
[Message 7] Noah: ""Who were they?""

[Message 9] Chloe: ""Jessie? I think I met them once at a protest downtown. Seemed nice.""
[Message 10] Maya: ""Crazy world. Anyway, you guys still up for pizza tonight?""
[Message 11] Noah: ""Sure. Pizza sounds good. Distracts me from all this depressing stuff.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Yeah, count me in. Where we going?""
[Message 13] Chloe: ""I'm in too. Anywhere but near the museum, lol.""
[Message 14] Maya: ""Deal. Okay, so 7pm at Antonio's?""

[Message 17] Chloe: ""Later!""
[Message 18] Maya: ""Hey, Liam, quick question – did you see anyone strange around the museum lately? You live closest.""
[Message 19] Liam: ""Strange? Nah. Just the usual tourists and that weird guy who always yells about aliens. Why?""
[Message 20] Maya: ""Just curious. Police are asking around.""
[Message 21] Liam: ""Oh, right. Hope they catch whoever did it.""
[Message 22] Noah: ""So, pizza is still on?""
[Message 23] Maya: ""Yep, still on. See you guys later.""
[Message 24] Chloe: ""Guys, I just saw on the news they said it was blunt force trauma. Horrible.""

[Message 44] Chloe: ""Ew, seriously? Bit on the nose, don't you think?""
[Message 45] Noah: ""Just trying to lighten the mood with some dark humor. Bad idea?""
[Message 46] Chloe: ""Maybe a little. Just be careful what you say around other people, you know?""
[Message 47] Noah: ""Got it. Thanks, Chloe.""
[Message 48] Chloe: ""No problem. Just looking out for you.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""Hey, Maya, I saw Ben around the museum at noon. Weird time for him, right?""
[Message 50] Maya: ""Ben? What was he doing?""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Just standing there, looking nervous. He told me he was meeting Bob for something but I am not sure.""
[Message 52] Maya: ""Interesting. I'll keep that in mind.""
[Message 53] Liam: ""He looked like he intended to do something.""
[Message 54] Maya: ""Did he say anything else?""

[Message 73] Maya: ""Like what?""
[Message 74] Liam: ""They said he was involved in some shady dealings with a corrections officer at the museum.""
[Message 75] Maya: ""Seriously? I hadn't heard that.""
[Message 76] Liam: ""Yeah, that's why Jessie, the corrections officer, were involved. Sounds like a cover-up.""
[Message 77] Maya: ""Wow. This is getting complicated. Makes you wonder who really knew what was happening. He always hated Jessie.""
[Message 78] Liam: ""Right? I knew something was off. We should tell the cops.""
[Message 79] Maya: ""Hold on. Let's think this through first. This could be dangerous.""
[Message 80] Liam: ""Dangerous? What do you mean?""
[Message 81] Maya: ""Just… be careful, Liam. Some things are better left alone. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 82] Liam: ""I don't like the sound of that, Maya.""

[Message 101] Maya: ""What? I haven't seen Ben in weeks. What are you implying, Liam?""
[Message 102] Liam: ""Just asking. He mentioned something about it. Seemed important.""
[Message 103] Maya: ""He's lying. He's trying to turn us against each other, Liam! He knew Jessie.""
[Message 104] Liam: ""Okay, okay. Calm down. Just seemed weird.""
[Message 105] Maya: ""Don't trust him, Liam. Promise me.""
[Message 106] Liam: ""I promise. But what if he saw us somewhere? What if he intended to cause trouble.""
[Message 107] Maya: ""He's just trying to scare us. Don't let him. I said I wanted to get rid of him so I could meet you.""
[Message 108] Liam: ""Okay, Maya. I trust you.""

[Message 112] Maya: ""Let's hope so.""

[Message 2] Ben: Yeah, it's pretty nice from here. Rehab center needs better landscaping though.
[Message 3] Casey: Agreed on both counts, Alex and Ben! Colors are amazing. Ben, you and your eye for detail!
[Message 4] Dana: Taking a moment to appreciate it too. Needed the break.
[Message 5] Alex: Totally Dana, hard work pays off!
[Message 6] Ben: Speaking of hard work, anyone see that documentary on pharmacists?
[Message 7] Casey: Sounds riveting, Ben. Sticking with the sunset for now.
[Message 8] Dana: Pharmacists are essential though, Ben!
[Message 9] Alex: True that! Ben, you have insight.
[Message 10] Ben: Just saying! TV's been slow lately.
[Message 11] Casey: I've been meaning to start that new sports doc.
[Message 12] Dana: Which one, Casey?
[Message 13] Casey: The one on the minor league baseball team in Savannah.
[Message 14] Alex: Minor league teams are the best! Pure love of the game.
[Message 15] Ben: True. Less pressure.
[Message 16] Dana: Makes sense. Back to compliments, anyone get a good one lately?
[Message 17] Alex: Someone told me my photography skills are improving! Made my day.
[Message 18] Ben: Nice, Alex! You've got a good eye.
[Message 19] Casey: That's awesome, Alex!
[Message 20] Dana: That's wonderful Alex!
[Message 21] Alex: Thanks, everyone!
[Message 22] Ben: I got told I have a calming voice. Good for dispensing medication advice, I guess.
[Message 23] Casey: Calming voice is a superpower, Ben!
[Message 24] Dana: Agreed. Super helpful in your line of work, Ben.
[Message 25] Alex: Definitely, Ben! Essential skill.
[Message 26] Casey: What about you, Dana? Any compliments lately?
[Message 27] Dana: Someone said I was really good at explaining complex financial concepts.
[Message 28] Alex: That's impressive, Dana! Finance is a whole different language.
[Message 29] Ben: Indeed. Daunting.
[Message 30] Casey: Super useful skill!
[Message 31] Dana: Thanks all! Makes the job a little more enjoyable.
[Message 32] Alex: Casey, what about you? Compliments?
[Message 33] Casey: Someone said I'm good at keeping the peace amongst screaming teenagers.
[Message 34] Ben: High praise!
[Message 35] Dana: Sounds about right for a teacher!
[Message 36] Alex: Seriously! That takes patience.
[Message 37] Casey: It requires A LOT of patience.
[Message 38] Ben: So, on the topic of compliments... anyone ever had a really bad first date compliment?
[Message 39] Alex: Oh boy... I'm ready for this.
[Message 40] Dana: This should be good!
[Message 41] Casey: Bring it on, Ben.
[Message 42] Ben: Someone once told me I looked ""surprisingly good"" for my age.
[Message 43] Alex: Ouch. Backhanded much?
[Message 44] Dana: Wow. That's... not a compliment.
[Message 45] Casey: That's just rude.
[Message 46] Alex: I'd walk away.
[Message 47] Ben: I almost did. It set the tone for the whole evening.
[Message 48] Dana: I can imagine!
[Message 49] Casey: Ugh. What about you guys? Any first date disasters?
[Message 50] Alex: I had someone tell me my photography was ""just a hobby.""
[Message 51] Ben: That's dismissive!
[Message 52] Dana: That's awful, Alex. Photography is an art.
[Message 53] Casey: Seriously undermining!
[Message 54] Alex: Exactly!
[Message 55] Dana: My worst was when someone spent the entire date talking about their ex.
[Message 56] Alex: Classic!
[Message 57] Ben: Textbook!
[Message 58] Casey: The ultimate no-no.
[Message 59] Dana: I felt like I was in therapy, and not even getting paid for it.
[Message 60] Alex: Hahaha!
[Message 61] Ben: That's hilarious, Dana!
[Message 62] Casey: Omg.
[Message 63] Alex: Casey, your turn! Spill the beans!
[Message 64] Casey: I had someone show up to a date wearing a full sports jersey, head-to-toe.
[Message 65] Ben: Which team?
[Message 66] Dana: Oh no.
[Message 67] Alex: Yikes.
[Message 68] Casey: Doesn't matter. It was the commitment, not the team. On a first date!
[Message 69] Ben: Point taken!
[Message 70] Dana: I get it.
[Message 71] Alex: Yeah, that's intense.
[Message 72] Ben: Alright, date nightmares aside... anyone got any plans for the weekend?
[Message 73] Alex: Thinking of heading up to Yosemite to get some shots.

[Message 75] Casey: Yosemite is beautiful!
[Message 76] Ben: Take lots of pictures, Alex!
[Message 77] Alex: Will do!

[Message 79] Alex: Sounds lovely, Dana!
[Message 80] Ben: Peaceful.

[Message 95] Dana: Sometimes, yeah. I overthink it.
[Message 96] Casey: I'm afraid of sounding insincere.
[Message 97] Alex: Exactly!
[Message 98] Dana: I think genuine appreciation is key though.
[Message 99] Alex: Agreed. It needs to be authentic.
[Message 100] Casey: And specific. ""Nice shirt"" is less impactful than ""That blue really suits you.""

[Message 102] Dana: Makes sense!
[Message 103] Alex: I also think it's about noticing the little things.

[Message 159] Casey: Hope so!
[Message 160] Dana: Definitely!
[Message 161] Alex: Anyway, just wanted to share!
[Message 162] Ben: Thanks for sharing, Alex!
[Message 163] Casey: Appreciate it!
[Message 164] Dana: Made my day a little brighter!
[Message 165] Alex: Awesome!
[Message 166] Ben: On a totally different note... anyone tried that new coffee shop downtown?
[Message 167] Alex: I haven't!
[Message 168] Casey: Me neither.
[Message 169] Dana: I've heard good things!
[Message 170] Ben: Supposedly they have amazing lattes.
[Message 171] Alex: I might have to check it out.
[Message 172] Casey: Me too!
[Message 173] Dana: I'm in!
[Message 174] Ben: Maybe we can all go sometime.
[Message 175] Alex: That would be great!
[Message 176] Casey: Sounds good!
[Message 177] Dana: I'm free next week.
[Message 178] Ben: Perfect! We'll figure it out.
[Message 179] Alex: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 180] Casey: Awesome!
[Message 181] Dana: Looking forward to it!
[Message 182] Ben: Alright, gotta run. Talk to you all later!

[Message 186] Alex: Well, that was fun!
[Message 187] Casey: Agreed!
[Message 188] Dana: Definitely!
[Message 189] Alex: I'm gonna head inside. It's getting chilly.
[Message 190] Casey: Me too.
[Message 191] Dana: Same here.

311,"[Message 1] Alex: So, midnight at the lazy river...anyone else think this is slightly surreal?
[Message 2] Riley: Haha, yeah, but kinda cool, right? Especially with all the lights.
[Message 3] Sam: Definitely. It's a nice change of pace. Anyone having weird dreams lately?
[Message 4] Alex: Actually, yeah! I had this dream last night where I was giving a presentation to a room full of cats.
[Message 5] Riley: OMG, that's hilarious! What were you presenting about?
[Message 6] Alex: I have no idea! That's the weirdest part. Just...cat food? Maybe?
[Message 7] Sam: Classic dream logic. I had one where I was building a skyscraper out of pancakes.
[Message 8] Riley: You win. Pancake skyscraper is officially the best dream ever.
[Message 9] Alex: Agreed. My cat presentation pales in comparison.
[Message 10] Sam: Speaking of presentations, how's your job interview prep going, Riley?
[Message 11] Riley: It's going...okay. I'm mostly just trying to remember STAR method responses.
[Message 12] Alex: The STAR method always trips me up. I end up rambling.
[Message 13] Sam: Just practice! Write down some key points, not the whole story.
[Message 14] Riley: Good tip, Sam. Thanks! I'll try that.
[Message 15] Alex: So, back to dreams…any theories on why we dream what we dream?
[Message 16] Sam: I think it's our brain processing stuff from the day, mixed with random anxieties and desires.
[Message 17] Riley: Yeah, makes sense. A total mind dump.
[Message 18] Alex: That's a good way to put it. A nightly cerebral cleanse.
[Message 19] Sam: Exactly! Cleansing with pancake skyscrapers and cat food presentations.
[Message 20] Riley: Don’t forget the room full of cats. That detail is essential.
[Message 21] Alex: Fair enough. Cats are now officially part of the dream cleansing ritual.
[Message 22] Sam: Okay, random thought: anyone else ever try to control their dreams? Lucid dreaming?
[Message 23] Riley: I've tried! But I always get too excited and wake myself up.
[Message 24] Alex: I've read about it, but never actually attempted it. Seems tricky.
[Message 25] Sam: It is. It takes practice. I've only done it a few times successfully.
[Message 26] Riley: What’s it like?
[Message 27] Sam: It's pretty wild. You're aware you're dreaming, so you can theoretically do anything.
[Message 28] Alex: Like fly?
[Message 29] Sam: Like fly! Or teleport. Or have a tea party with historical figures. Whatever your heart desires.
[Message 30] Riley: Tea party with historical figures sounds amazing! I'm sold.
[Message 31] Alex: Okay, lucid dreaming is officially added to my to-do list.
[Message 32] Sam: There are some good apps and online resources if you're serious about it.
[Message 33] Riley: I'll check those out. Thanks, Sam!
[Message 34] Alex: Me too. Maybe we can all compare notes next week.
[Message 35] Sam: Sounds like a plan! So, what's everyone's dream job, if we're talking dreams?
[Message 36] Riley: Besides pancake skyscraper architect?
[Message 37] Alex: Heh.
[Message 38] Sam: Good one, Riley.
[Message 39] Riley: Honestly? Something that involves traveling and experiencing new cultures.
[Message 40] Alex: I've always wanted to be a full-time artist, just drawing all day.
[Message 41] Sam: That sounds peaceful. Mine would be something in technology, maybe developing new AI.
[Message 42] Riley: AI? That's ambitious!
[Message 43] Sam: It's the future! And it's fascinating.
[Message 44] Alex: I can see that. I'm still a little wary of AI taking over the world, though.
[Message 45] Sam: Haha, that's just in the movies. For now, anyway.
[Message 46] Riley: Famous last words.
[Message 47] Alex: Exactly!
[Message 48] Sam: Okay, okay, I promise to program safeguards. No robot uprising on my watch.
[Message 49] Riley: Deal!
[Message 50] Alex: I'll hold you to that.
[Message 51] Sam: You should. So, back to the real world…anyone else getting hungry?
[Message 52] Riley: Always. Midnight and lazy rivers make me ravenous.
[Message 53] Alex: Me too. I could go for some pizza.
[Message 54] Sam: Pizza sounds perfect. Anyone know if anything's still open this late?
[Message 55] Riley: I think there's a 24-hour place a few blocks from here.
[Message 56] Alex: Awesome! Post-lazy-river pizza run, then?
[Message 57] Sam: I'm in.
[Message 58] Riley: Count me in too!
[Message 59] Alex: Perfect. So, pizza dreams tonight, everyone.
[Message 60] Sam: You got it. Maybe I'll dream of building a pizza skyscraper.
[Message 61] Riley: With cat food toppings?
[Message 62] Alex: Oh, please no.
[Message 63] Sam: Haha, okay, no cat food. Just pepperoni and mushrooms.
[Message 64] Riley: Sounds much better.
[Message 65] Alex: Agreed. Much, much better.
[Message 66] Sam: Speaking of mushrooms, anyone got any good new music recommendations?
[Message 67] Riley: I've been listening to this indie band, ""Sunset Echoes."" They're pretty chill.
[Message 68] Alex: I'll check them out. I mostly listen to classical music these days.
[Message 69] Sam: Nice! I'm more of an electronic music person myself.
[Message 70] Riley: Variety is the spice of life, right?
[Message 71] Alex: Absolutely.
[Message 72] Sam: Totally. Okay, pizza time soon?
[Message 73] Riley: I’m ready when you are. My stomach is rumbling.
[Message 74] Alex: Let's do it. Should we pack up our stuff?
[Message 75] Sam: Yeah, good idea. Let's gather everything up.
[Message 76] Riley: Alright, one last lazy river lap before we go?
[Message 77] Alex: One last lap!
[Message 78] Sam: Okay, one last lap. Pizza awaits!
[Message 79] Alex: To pizza and weird dreams!
[Message 80] Riley: Cheers to that!",0,
312,"[Message 1] Liam: Hey guys, heard about what happened at the bookstore? Crazy.

[Message 2] Chloe: Yeah, Liam. Awful about Alex and Jordan...

[Message 3] Noah: Bookstore? What happened? I was off the grid all day.

[Message 4] Maya: Noah, seriously? Alex, the Corrections Officer, and Jordan, that Law Enforcement Officer, were found dead at Book Store. Poisoning via ingestion!

[Message 5] Noah: What?! No way! Jordan? I just saw him yesterday. What the hell happened?

[Message 6] Ethan: Heard it was Poisoning via ingestion. Pretty messed up.

[Message 7] Chloe: Ethan, you seem awfully calm about this.

[Message 8] Ethan: Just saying what I heard, Chloe. Everyone's talking about it.

[Message 9] Liam: Anyone know any details? Police aren't saying much.

[Message 10] Maya: Apparently, it happened Afternoon.

[Message 11] Noah: Afternoon? I was at the gym then. I can prove it.

[Message 12] Chloe: Nobody's accusing you, Noah. Relax.

[Message 13] Liam: Chloe's right, man. Just trying to piece things together.

[Message 14] Ethan: I was at work all day. Clocked in and out.

[Message 15] Maya: I heard Alex was giving someone trouble. Something about exposing a secret?

[Message 16] Liam: Maya, where'd you hear that?

[Message 17] Maya: Just rumors, Liam. Going around.

[Message 18] Noah: Alex always seemed so withdrawn. Hard to imagine him causing trouble.

[Message 19] Chloe: Jordan was always anxious, but a good kid. This is terrible.

[Message 20] Ethan: Jordan was supposed to give me a ride this week. Now he's gone.

[Message 21] Liam: Ethan, I'm really sorry, man.

[Message 22] Ethan: Thanks, Liam.

[Message 23] Maya: Did anyone see anything suspicious around the bookstore lately?

[Message 24] Chloe: I saw David hanging around there a couple of days ago. He looked really shifty.

[Message 25] Liam: David? I thought he moved away.

[Message 26] Chloe: Maybe he's back. Just saying, he was there.

[Message 27] Noah: David always had a thing against Alex. Hated him.

[Message 28] Ethan: I saw Sarah buying something at the store the other day, but I couldn't see what. It seemed like some kind of a Poisoning via ingestion.

[Message 29] Liam: Sarah? Why would she do that?

[Message 30] Maya: I don't know her very well.

[Message 31] Chloe: She's always been kind of odd.

[Message 32] Noah: Maybe she felt like she was doing them a favor? Ending their suffering?

[Message 33] Liam: Noah, that's a messed up thing to say.

[Message 34] Noah: Just thinking out loud, Liam. Jeez.

[Message 35] Ethan: I heard Jordan had a gambling problem. Could be related.

[Message 36] Maya: A gambling problem? I didn't know that.

[Message 37] Chloe: Me neither.

[Message 38] Liam: This is all just speculation. Let's not jump to conclusions.

[Message 39] Ethan: True. But still, something feels off.

[Message 40] Maya: I agree.

[Message 41] Noah: Anyone know if they found anything at the scene?

[Message 42] Chloe: Police aren't releasing anything.

[Message 43] Liam: We should just let them do their job.

[Message 44] Ethan: Yeah, but what if they miss something?

[Message 45] Maya: They're going to investigate thoroughly. I'm sure.

[Message 46] Noah: Still can't believe it. Poor Alex and Jordan.

[Message 47] Chloe: It's just so senseless.

[Message 48] Liam: Anyway, I gotta go. Catch you guys later.

[Message 49] Chloe: Bye, Liam.

[Message 50] Noah: Later.

[Message 51] Ethan: See ya.

[Message 52] Maya: Bye.

[Message 53] Ethan: Thinking about going to the bookstore tomorrow. Leaving some flowers.

[Message 54] Maya: That's a nice idea, Ethan.

[Message 55] Chloe: I might join you.

[Message 56] Noah: Count me in.

[Message 57] Ethan: Cool.

[Message 58] Maya: Maybe we can all grab coffee afterward?

[Message 59] Chloe: Sounds good.

[Message 60] Noah: I am in too.

[Message 61] Ethan: This is crazy how this happened at Afternoon, I heard.

[Message 62] Chloe: You know, it’s wild that Jordan was going to testify in that case.

[Message 63] Noah: Yeah, he was supposed to do that, someone needed to do it I think

[Message 64] Maya: His shouting probably provoked him.

315,"[Message 1] Sarah: Hey, you hear about what happened down at the Taxi Stand?

[Message 2] David: No, what's up?

[Message 3] Sarah: Awful. Two people dead. Judge Thompson and Alex.

[Message 4] David: Seriously? That's insane. I knew Alex. Small world.

[Message 5] Sarah: Yeah, it's a shock. Everyone's talking about it.

[Message 6] David: How did it happen?

[Message 7] Sarah: Don't know all the details, but apparently it was bad.

[Message 8] David: Crazy. So, you still up for that movie night next week?

[Message 9] Sarah: Yeah, definitely. Need something to take my mind off things.

[Message 10] David: Cool. I was thinking we could watch that new thriller.

[Message 11] Sarah: Sounds good. Maybe something a little lighter, though?

[Message 12] David: Alright, we'll figure it out. Oh, hey, gotta run. Talk later.

[Message 13] Sarah: Later!

[Message 14] Michael: Hey Sarah, you free to chat for a sec?

[Message 15] Sarah: Hey Michael, yeah, what's up?

[Message 16] Michael: Heard about Judge Thompson and Alex. Wild, right?

[Message 17] Sarah: Yeah, it's messed up.

[Message 18] Michael: Did you know either of them well?

[Message 19] Sarah: I knew Alex casually. Why?

[Message 20] Michael: Just curious. I heard some whispers about possible suspects.

[Message 21] Sarah: Oh? Like who?

[Message 22] Michael: Just rumors. Something about someone owing Judge Thompson money. I think i heard a person saying that he wants to get rid of him because of that.

[Message 23] Sarah: That's intense.

[Message 24] Michael: Yeah. Anyway, gotta get back to work. Talk soon.

[Message 25] Sarah: Later.

[Message 26] Emily: Hey Sarah, you okay? You seemed a bit off earlier.

[Message 27] Sarah: Hey Emily, just a little shaken by the news, you know?

[Message 28] Emily: I get it. It's awful. I heard Mark was at the Taxi Stand earlier that evening.

[Message 29] Sarah: Mark? Really? Why?

[Message 30] Emily: I don't know. He mentioned he was trying to catch a ride.

[Message 31] Sarah: Huh. Odd.

[Message 32] Emily: Yeah. Anyway, I'm here if you need anything.

[Message 33] Sarah: Thanks, Emily. Appreciate it.

[Message 34] David: Hey, quick question. Did you ever meet a guy named Mark?

[Message 35] Sarah: Yeah, I know Mark. Why?

[Message 36] David: Just wondering. He seemed a bit…intense the last time I saw him.

[Message 37] Sarah: Intense how?

[Message 38] David: Just, I don't know, agitated. He was talking about his inheritance or insurance, something like that.

[Message 39] Sarah: Weird.

[Message 40] David: Yeah. Anyway, forget I said anything.

[Message 41] Sarah: Okay…

[Message 42] Michael: Hey, you wouldn't happen to know if Mark had any beef with Judge Thompson, would you?

[Message 43] Sarah: I have no idea. Why do you ask?

[Message 44] Michael: Just piecing things together. Someone mentioned seeing them arguing a few weeks back.

[Message 45] Sarah: That's...concerning.

[Message 46] Michael: Yeah. Look, I gotta go. Catch you later.

[Message 47] Sarah: Right.

[Message 48] Emily: Hey, did you hear they're saying the victims were Asphyxiation by strangulation?

[Message 49] Sarah: Wow. That's horrible.

[Message 50] Emily: I know. Makes it even worse. I am sure they're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 51] Sarah: Absolutely.

[Message 52] David: You think they'll ever catch whoever did it?

[Message 53] Sarah: I hope so. For the families.

[Message 54] David: Yeah. It's just…scary.

[Message 55] Michael: Hey, you heard anything else about the investigation?

[Message 56] Sarah: Nothing concrete. Just rumors.

[Message 57] Michael: Right. Well, keep me in the loop if you hear anything.

[Message 58] Sarah: Will do.

[Message 59] Emily: I can't believe this happened in our city.

[Message 60] Sarah: Me neither.

[Message 61] David: I saw Mark leave the building at Early Evening.

[Message 62] Sarah: You did? Interesting...

[Message 63] Michael: Early Evening? That's when it happened, right?

[Message 64] Sarah: Apparently.

[Message 65] Emily: This is all so unsettling.

[Message 66] Sarah: Tell me about it.

[Message 67] David: Gotta head out. Talk to you soon.

[Message 68] Sarah: Later.

[Message 69] Michael: Catch you around.

[Message 70] Sarah: Yeah.

[Message 71] Emily: Night.

[Message 72] Sarah: Night.

[Message 73] David: Hey, you busy?

[Message 74] Sarah: Not really, what's up?

[Message 75] David: Just thinking about everything. It's bothering me.

[Message 76] Sarah: I know. Me too.

[Message 77] David: I keep replaying seeing Mark that night.

[Message 78] Sarah: It's probably nothing, David.

[Message 79] David: Maybe. But what if...?

[Message 80] Sarah: Don't do that to yourself.

[Message 81] David: I just… I need to clear my head.

[Message 82] Sarah: Go for a walk. Get some fresh air.

[Message 83] David: Yeah, maybe you're right.

[Message 84] Sarah: Definitely.

[Message 85] Michael: Hey, you free to talk?

[Message 86] Sarah: Yeah, what's up?

[Message 87] Michael: I was doing some digging and found out Mark was in serious debt.

[Message 88] Sarah: Debt? How much?

[Message 89] Michael: A lot. Enough to make him desperate.

[Message 90] Sarah: That's…significant.

[Message 91] Michael: Yeah. Just thought you should know.

[Message 92] Sarah: Thanks, Michael.

[Message 93] Michael: No problem.

[Message 94] Emily: You think they'll ever find out who did it?

[Message 95] Sarah: I hope so.

[Message 96] Emily: It's just so sad.

[Message 97] Sarah: It is.

[Message 98] David: I'm feeling a bit better after that walk. Thanks.

[Message 99] Sarah: Glad to hear it.

[Message 100] David: Still can't shake this feeling, though.

[Message 101] Sarah: What feeling?

[Message 102] David: That something's not right.

[Message 103] Sarah: Maybe you should talk to the police.

[Message 104] David: You think so?

[Message 105] Sarah: It couldn't hurt.

[Message 106] David: I don't want to get involved.

[Message 107] Sarah: I understand.

[Message 108] Michael: Hey, I'm going to the police with what I know about Mark.

[Message 109] Sarah: Good for you, Michael.

[Message 110] Michael: Someone needs to speak up.

[Message 111] Sarah: Agreed.

[Message 112] Michael: Talk soon.

[Message 113] Sarah: Yeah.

[Message 114] Emily: I just keep thinking about their families.

[Message 115] Sarah: Me too.

[Message 116] Emily: It's just so unfair.

[Message 117] Sarah: Life is, sometimes.

[Message 118] David: I decided I'm not saying anything.

[Message 119] Sarah: Are you sure that's the right decision?

[Message 120] David: Yeah. I don't want any trouble.

[Message 121] Sarah: Okay.

[Message 122] Michael: Just got back from the station.

[Message 123] Sarah: How did it go?

[Message 124] Michael: They seemed interested in what I had to say about Mark's debts.

[Message 125] Sarah: Good. Hopefully, it helps them catch the person.",1,
316,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey guys, anyone else super early for this flight?
[Message 2] Ben: You know it, Alex! I'm at gate C14, waiting for the coffee shop to open.
[Message 3] Carol: Me too. Gate C12. Figured I'd rather be early than stressed.
[Message 4] Alex: C16 here. Anyone know where the best coffee is around here? This airport is a maze.
[Message 5] Ben: Carol, you're closer. Any intel on coffee?
[Message 6] Carol: Honestly, the Starbucks near security is probably your best bet. But it's always packed.
[Message 7] Alex: Ugh, Starbucks. I was hoping for something… less Starbucks.
[Message 8] Ben: Agreed. But desperate times, desperate measures. Anyway, anyone got big family plans for the holidays?
[Message 9] Carol: Oh boy, here we go. A full house. My grandkids are coming in from California.
[Message 10] Alex: Nice! My family's all pretty local, so it's just a big dinner at my aunt's.
[Message 11] Ben: I'm heading to my parents' place in Columbus. All my siblings will be there. Chaos guaranteed.
[Message 12] Carol: Chaos is the spice of life, dear. At least, that's what I tell myself.
[Message 13] Alex: True. I love my family, but sometimes I need a vacation *from* my family.
[Message 14] Ben: Haha, preach. We all feel that.
[Message 15] Carol: Tell me about it. This year, I'm delegating the cooking. No more stressing over the turkey.
[Message 16] Alex: Smart move, Carol. What's everyone's favorite holiday tradition?
[Message 17] Ben: We always play board games after dinner. Gets pretty competitive.
[Message 18] Carol: My grandkids insist on decorating the tree, even though I think it's a disaster.
[Message 19] Alex: Haha, that's sweet. We have a white elephant gift exchange that always gets interesting.
[Message 20] Ben: White elephant? Sounds fun. What's the worst gift you ever got?
[Message 21] Alex: Oh man, a singing bass. Still haunts my dreams.
[Message 22] Carol: A singing bass? Oh, that's terrible. I received a crocheted toilet paper cozy once.
[Message 23] Ben: A crocheted toilet paper cozy? That’s… something. I got a book on ventriloquism.
[Message 24] Alex: Ventriloquism? Did you ever try it?
[Message 25] Ben: Briefly. I was terrible. The dummy and I had a falling out.
[Message 26] Carol: You're a funny one, Ben.
[Message 27] Alex: So, anyone else doing any traveling besides for the holidays?
[Message 28] Carol: I'm planning a trip to Italy next spring, if I can ever get my passport renewed.
[Message 29] Ben: Italy sounds amazing! I've always wanted to go.
[Message 30] Alex: Same! Italy is definitely on my bucket list. I'm thinking about visiting Iceland next year.
[Message 31] Carol: Iceland? That's quite a change of pace from Italy.
[Message 32] Alex: Yeah, I want to see the Northern Lights.
[Message 33] Ben: That would be incredible. I'm trying to save up for a down payment on a house. Travel is on hold for now.
[Message 34] Carol: Sensible. Always good to be practical.
[Message 35] Alex: True. Adulting is hard.
[Message 36] Ben: Tell me about it. Anyone else stressed about taxes?
[Message 37] Carol: Oh, don't even get me started.
[Message 38] Alex: I just try to ignore it until April. Bad strategy, I know.
[Message 39] Ben: Yeah, that's what I used to do. Now I have an accountant. Best money I ever spent.
[Message 40] Carol: I've considered that. Maybe this year I'll finally bite the bullet.
[Message 41] Alex: Speaking of biting the bullet, that coffee shop is finally open. Gotta go!
[Message 42] Ben: See ya! Grab me a black coffee if you're feeling generous.
[Message 43] Alex: Haha, no promises.
[Message 44] Carol: Have a good one, Alex.
[Message 45] Ben: So Carol, any tips for keeping the grandkids entertained?
[Message 46] Carol: Oh, I have a whole arsenal. Coloring books, board games, and lots and lots of snacks.
[Message 47] Ben: Good to know. My nieces and nephews have endless energy.
[Message 48] Carol: They do. It's a blessing and a curse.
[Message 49] Ben: Exactly.
[Message 50] Alex: (Texting from coffee shop line) This line is insane!
[Message 51] Ben: Told ya.
[Message 52] Carol: Patience, young grasshopper.
[Message 53] Alex: I saw a guy buy THREE of those giant muffins. THREE!
[Message 54] Ben: He's living his best life, Alex.
[Message 55] Carol: Let him enjoy his muffins.
[Message 56] Alex: Okay, okay. I'm trying to be less judgmental.
[Message 57] Ben: Baby steps.
[Message 58] Carol: That's all you can do.
[Message 59] Alex: Okay, coffee acquired. Heading back to the gate.
[Message 60] Ben: You're a lifesaver.
[Message 61] Carol: Enjoy!
[Message 62] Alex: Anyone else notice that weirdly dressed guy over there?
[Message 63] Ben: Nope, too busy contemplating the existential dread of holiday travel.
[Message 64] Carol: I try not to notice anyone. Keeps my blood pressure down.
[Message 65] Alex: Fair enough. He's wearing a full suit of armor. Seriously.
[Message 66] Ben: A suit of armor? Maybe he's going to a Renaissance fair.
[Message 67] Carol: Or maybe he's just eccentric. Let him be.
[Message 68] Alex: True. Live and let live.
[Message 69] Ben: Exactly. Besides, who are we to judge? I’m wearing sweatpants and a hoodie.
[Message 70] Carol: Comfort is key when traveling.
[Message 71] Alex: You're both right. I'm just bored.
[Message 72] Ben: Download a game on your phone.
[Message 73] Carol: Read a book.
[Message 74] Alex: Good ideas. Thanks!
[Message 75] Ben: No problem. Just trying to help you avoid commenting on strangers in suits of armor.
[Message 76] Alex: Point taken.
[Message 77] Carol: So, Ben, what kind of board games do you play with your family?
[Message 78] Ben: We're big fans of Settlers of Catan and Ticket to Ride. Things can get pretty heated.
[Message 79] Carol: I've heard of Settlers of Catan. Sounds complicated.
[Message 80] Alex: It is, but it's fun once you get the hang of it.
[Message 81] Ben: Yeah, it's all about resource management and backstabbing.
[Message 82] Carol: Backstabbing? Sounds like my kind of game.
[Message 83] Alex: You'd fit right in with my family.
[Message 84] Ben: Definitely. We have a strict no-holds-barred policy.
[Message 85] Carol: I like it.
[Message 86] Alex: Okay, I'm officially downloading Settlers of Catan.
[Message 87] Ben: Atta boy! Or girl! Or… person!
[Message 88] Carol: Just be careful not to get too addicted.
[Message 89] Alex: I'll try my best.
[Message 90] Ben: So, Carol, how many grandkids do you have?
[Message 91] Carol: Four. Two boys and two girls. They keep me young, or at least, they think they do.
[Message 92] Ben: That's a good amount! My parents are always bugging me to give them grandkids.
[Message 93] Carol: Don't rush into anything. It's a big responsibility.
[Message 94] Alex: True. Huge.
[Message 95] Ben: I know, I know. I'm not ready yet.
[Message 96] Carol: You'll know when the time is right.
[Message 97] Alex: Speaking of knowing when the time is right, the gate agent just arrived.
[Message 98] Ben: Finally!
[Message 99] Carol: About time.
[Message 100] Alex: Boarding will probably start soon.
[Message 101] Ben: Well, it was nice chatting with you both.
[Message 102] Carol: You too, Ben. Have a safe flight.
[Message 103] Alex: Yeah, safe travels!
[Message 104] Ben: You as well!
[Message 105] Carol: Thanks. I'm going to grab a newspaper and find a seat closer to the gate.
[Message 106] Alex: Smart move. See ya!
[Message 107] Ben: Catch ya later!
[Message 108] Alex: (A few minutes later) They just announced pre-boarding.
[Message 109] Ben: Figures. I'm always in the last group.
[Message 110] Carol: (Texting from her seat) Good luck, everyone.
[Message 111] Alex: Thanks! Wish me luck surviving the flight.
[Message 112] Ben: You got this! Just think of all the fun you'll have at the holidays.
[Message 113] Carol: Exactly. Focus on the good times.
[Message 114] Alex: Trying, trying.
[Message 115] Ben: Anyone have a window seat? Those are the best.
[Message 116] Alex: I managed to snag one!
[Message 117] Carol: Lucky you. I always end up in the middle.
[Message 118] Ben: The bane of my existence.

[Message 2] Ben: ""Yeah, crazy, right? Some cop named Officer Miller, I think. Terrible news.""
[Message 3] Sarah: ""I know, I saw Anya near there Late Afternoon yesterday. Thought that was odd, since she works late at the bakery""
[Message 4] Ben: ""Anya? Really? She seemed upset the other day when Miller was there. He said he wanted to get rid of him during the argument""
[Message 5] Sarah: ""Small world, I guess. What's up with you? You sound weird.""
[Message 6] Ben: ""Just stressed. Work stuff. Trying to get this project done. Did you see Daniel yesterday? He mentioned that he went to the synagogue before to help set up for an event.""
[Message 7] Sarah: ""Daniel? No, haven't seen him in ages. Why?""
[Message 8] Ben: ""No reason. Just making conversation. They're going away for a long time for this, I just know it.""
[Message 9] Sarah: ""Well, whoever did it, I hope they catch them. You going to the game tonight?""
[Message 10] Ben: ""Nah, too much going on. You?""
[Message 11] Sarah: ""Maybe. Depends. Anya told me she was buying a weird knife set at the store. Said it was for a cooking class, but seems strange, right?""
[Message 12] Ben: ""Could be anything. Don't jump to conclusions. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 13] Sarah: ""True. Anyway, I gotta run. Talk later.""
[Message 14] Ben: ""Later. Oh, and Sarah, if Daniel calls, tell him I'm not interested in whatever he's selling.""
[Message 15] Sarah: ""Will do. He's always trying to sell something. Hey, someone told me that Anya was shouting at Officer Miller right before he went over there.""
[Message 16] Ben: ""Wow, things are really heating up for Anya.""
[Message 17] Sarah: ""Heard some dude with a stutter saw her leave at Late Afternoon.""
[Message 18] Ben: ""Whoa. Maybe she shouldn't have fired Anya.""
[Message 19] Sarah: ""She knew he was going to find out anyway.""
[Message 20] Sarah: ""Maybe that's just a rumor. People talk.""
[Message 21] Ben: ""People do talk. I thought I saw Daniel looking up how to make Impalement with a sharp object online. But I wasn't sure.""
[Message 22] Sarah: ""Okay, that's... worrying. Maybe you should tell the police about Daniel. What if he was trying to get rid of him?""
[Message 23] Ben: ""I don't know... I don't want to get involved. He always hated Officer Miller.""
[Message 24] Sarah: ""I get it, but it's serious. This could all be avoided if someone called 911 right away.""

[Message 2] Jordan: ""You read my mind, Alex! My cat, Mittens, is probably plotting my demise for being gone so long.""
[Message 3] Sam: ""Haha, same here. My dog, Buster, gets super dramatic when I leave. Acts like he hasn't eaten in days, even though he had a full bowl this morning.""
[Message 4] Alex: ""Buster sounds adorable! What kind of dog is he?""
[Message 5] Sam: ""He's a golden retriever. A big, fluffy drama queen.""
[Message 6] Jordan: ""Mittens is a calico, and she's the queen of judgement. Always judging.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""My parakeet, Pip, is just loud. Very, very loud. But I love him.""
[Message 8] Jordan: ""A parakeet! I haven't seen one of those in ages. Does he talk?""
[Message 9] Alex: ""He tries! It's mostly squawks and whistles, but occasionally I swear I hear him say 'hello'.""
[Message 10] Sam: ""That's amazing! I always wanted a talking bird.""
[Message 11] Jordan: ""Talking animals are cool. I saw this video of a dog 'singing' opera the other day.""
[Message 12] Alex: ""Speaking of singing, has anyone seen the feedback I left on the new facade design?""

[Message 14] Jordan: ""I'll check it out too after I finish responding to these emails.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Thanks, both of you. Appreciate it.""
[Message 16] Sam: ""No problem! So, back to pets – anyone ever considered getting a reptile?""
[Message 17] Jordan: ""Oh, man. I'm way too clumsy for a reptile. I'd probably step on it accidentally.""
[Message 18] Alex: ""Haha, I can see that happening. I'm more of a furry or feathered friend kind of person.""
[Message 19] Sam: ""I always thought a bearded dragon would be cool. They seem pretty chill.""
[Message 20] Jordan: ""They do look pretty chill. I saw one wearing a tiny hat once.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""A tiny hat? That's hilarious. I need to see that.""
[Message 22] Sam: ""I'll try to find the picture. It was on some reptile enthusiast forum.""
[Message 23] Jordan: ""Speaking of forums, anyone know where I can find a good sports podcast?""
[Message 24] Alex: ""Depends what you're into. I've been listening to a car podcast lately, it's called 'Driven'.""
[Message 25] Sam: ""I sometimes listen to news podcasts while I'm cooking. Keeps me updated.""
[Message 26] Jordan: ""Good call, Sam. I'll check those out. Thanks!""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Alright, back to the pet discussion. What's the weirdest thing your pet has ever done?""
[Message 28] Sam: ""Buster once ate an entire roll of toilet paper. Unrolled it all over the living room first, of course.""
[Message 29] Jordan: ""Mittens likes to 'bury' her toys in my shoes. I'll find them in the weirdest places.""
[Message 30] Alex: ""Pip once tried to eat my glasses. He thought they were a new toy, I guess.""
[Message 31] Sam: ""Pets are such goofballs. It's why we love them, right?""
[Message 32] Jordan: ""Totally! They bring so much joy to our lives.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Absolutely. Even when they're being complete menaces.""
[Message 34] Sam: ""So true! Hey, has anyone heard back from the client about the window placement?""
[Message 35] Jordan: ""Not yet, Sam. I think they're still reviewing the plans.""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Hopefully we'll hear something soon. I'm eager to move forward with that phase.""
[Message 37] Sam: ""Me too. Anyway, back to pets. What's your favorite thing about having one?""
[Message 38] Jordan: ""The unconditional love. No matter what, Mittens is always happy to see me (or at least pretends to be).""
[Message 39] Alex: ""For me, it's the companionship. Pip makes the apartment feel less empty.""
[Message 40] Sam: ""Definitely the companionship. And the endless entertainment. Buster is a constant source of amusement.""
[Message 41] Jordan: ""Amen to that! Anyone thinking about getting another pet?""
[Message 42] Alex: ""I've considered getting Pip a friend, but I'm worried about the noise level.""
[Message 43] Sam: ""I've thought about getting a smaller dog to keep Buster company, but I'm not sure if I can handle two big dogs.""
[Message 44] Jordan: ""I'm good with one cat for now. Mittens is enough chaos for one household.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Fair enough! So, any fun plans for the weekend?""
[Message 46] Sam: ""I'm planning on taking Buster to the dog park. He loves socializing with other dogs.""
[Message 47] Jordan: ""I'm going to try and catch a baseball game. Hopefully the weather cooperates.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""I might go for a drive in the country. Just relax and enjoy the scenery.""
[Message 49] Sam: ""Sounds lovely! Well, I should probably get going. Buster's waiting for his evening walk.""
[Message 50] Jordan: ""Yeah, me too. Mittens is probably plotting her revenge for my absence.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Alright, goodnight you two! Have a great weekend!""
[Message 52] Sam: ""Goodnight, Alex! You too!""
[Message 53] Jordan: ""Night, guys!""
[Message 54] Alex: ""Before I forget, Sam, what kind of food do you give Buster? My sister's golden has some tummy issues.""
[Message 55] Sam: ""He's on a grain-free diet. It's helped a lot with his digestion. I can send you the brand name if you want.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""That would be amazing, thanks!""

[Message 3] Alex: Morning you two. Community garden, huh? That’s cool. I was just thinking we need more green spaces.

[Message 4] Daniel: I agree, Alex. Anything that improves the community is a plus. Martha, are you volunteering there?

[Message 5] Martha: I'm considering it, Daniel. My tomatoes are bursting, I could donate some starts.

[Message 6] Alex: I've been meaning to get more involved in local stuff. Besides the garden, anything else going on?

[Message 7] Daniel: Heard they're finally repaving Main Street. About time! My car will thank them.

[Message 8] Martha: Oh, yes! The potholes are terrible. It’s going to be a mess with traffic though, right?

[Message 9] Alex: Traffic is already a mess. Hopefully, they'll do it at night. Anyone seen the sunset lately? It's been spectacular.

[Message 10] Daniel: I did, Alex! Snapped a few photos. I’ll show you later. Regarding the Main Street paving, they said it'll be mostly overnight.

[Message 11] Martha: That’s good news, Daniel. Less disruption.

[Message 12] Alex: Speaking of photos, Daniel, how's that photography class going?

[Message 13] Daniel: It's going well, Alex! Learning a lot about composition.

[Message 14] Martha: You always take such lovely photos, Daniel. Are you exhibiting anywhere soon?

[Message 15] Daniel: Not yet, Martha, but I'm thinking about entering a local competition.

[Message 16] Alex: You should, Daniel! You'd definitely win. What kind of camera are you using these days?

[Message 17] Daniel: Still my trusty Nikon, Alex. It gets the job done.

[Message 18] Martha: Back to the local news, I saw they're planning another outdoor concert series at Pier Plaza.

[Message 19] Alex: Oh, cool! What kind of music?

[Message 20] Martha: I think it's a mix, Alex. Some classic rock, some country, some blues.

[Message 21] Daniel: Sounds fun! I might check that out.

[Message 22] Alex: Me too. Good way to spend an evening. So, Martha, you're still busy with the sales rep job?

[Message 23] Martha: Yes, Alex, busier than ever! Lots of travel lately.

[Message 24] Daniel: Travel can be exhausting, Martha.

[Message 27] Daniel: I did, Alex. Seems like a tough situation. Balancing residents' peace and business needs.

[Message 28] Martha: A tricky balance indeed. I wonder what they decided.

[Message 29] Alex: Haven't heard the results yet. Maybe it'll be in the next news cycle. I have to present my report next week.

[Message 36] Daniel: That sounds fascinating, Alex. Could really help with the traffic flow.

[Message 37] Martha: Absolutely. Will they actually implement it, do you think?

[Message 38] Alex: That's what the presentation is for - to convince them it's worth the investment.

[Message 39] Daniel: Well, I'm sure you'll do a great job presenting it.

[Message 40] Martha: Fingers crossed! It would make a huge difference.

[Message 41] Alex: Yeah, I hope so. I'm hungry. You guys want to grab some lunch after this?

[Message 50] Alex: Definitely. The waves have been pretty good lately.

[Message 51] Daniel: I might try to get some shots of the surfers. Good photo opportunity.

[Message 52] Martha: You should, Daniel! They always make for stunning pictures.

[Message 36] Carlos: ""Spiritual stuff, huh? Like what?""
[Message 37] Brenda: ""I don't know, cult-like rituals and stuff. Real weird.""

[Message 49] Brenda: ""Just that she's been acting strange.""
[Message 50] Ashley: ""Very strange.""
[Message 51] Carlos: ""I heard she's been seeing a therapist. Maybe she's just stressed.""

[Message 61] Brenda: ""Will do. This is just so messed up.""

[Message 69] Brenda: ""No, why? You did?""
[Message 70] Ashley: ""Yeah, briefly. She seemed upset about something.""
[Message 71] Brenda: ""Upset about what?""
[Message 72] Ashley: ""I don't know, she didn't say. Just seemed...off.""
[Message 73] Brenda: ""Hmm. Weird.""
[Message 74] Ashley: ""Yeah. Just thought I'd ask.""

[Message 76] Ashley: ""Night.""
[Message 77] Carlos: ""Anyone still up?""
[Message 78] Brenda: ""Me. Can't sleep.""
[Message 79] Ashley: ""Me neither.""
[Message 80] Carlos: ""I was just thinking...Ben was looking up how to make Blunt force trauma with a hammer online last week. He showed me. Thought he was joking.""
[Message 81] Brenda: ""Carlos! Seriously? Why didn't you tell the cops that?!""
[Message 82] Ashley: ""Unbelievable! You knew all along!""
[Message 83] Carlos: ""I didn't *know*! I thought he was kidding! It's Ben!""
[Message 84] Brenda: ""Still...that's pretty damning.""
[Message 85] Ashley: ""I'm calling the police. Right now.""
[Message 86] Carlos: ""Wait, Ashley! Don't!""
[Message 87] Brenda: ""Carlos, what the hell is wrong with you?!""
[Message 88] Carlos: ""I...I just don't want to get involved.""
[Message 89] Ashley: ""Involved?! A woman is dead!""
[Message 90] Brenda: ""Ashley, calm down. Let's all calm down.""
[Message 91] Ashley: ""No! I'm done being calm! This is insane!""
[Message 92] Carlos: ""Look, maybe it wasn't Ben. Maybe someone else did it.""
[Message 93] Brenda: ""Like who, Carlos? Kim, with her 'cult rituals'?""
[Message 94] Ashley: ""Or maybe you, Carlos? You were the last one to see 5.  Corrections Officer yesterday, you were buying lottery tickets, and you knew about the hammer!""
[Message 95] Carlos: ""Whoa, Ashley! That's messed up! I'm not a murderer!""
[Message 96] Brenda: ""Everyone, just stop. This is getting out of hand.""
[Message 97] Ashley: ""I'm still calling the police.""
[Message 98] Carlos: ""Fine! Call them! See if I care!""
[Message 99] Brenda: ""Ashley, please wait. Let's think this through.""
[Message 100] Ashley: ""There's nothing to think through! A woman is dead, and we know someone who knew how to make a hammer and was mad! Concurrence!""
[Message 101] Carlos: ""I swear, I didn't do anything! I just bought milk!""
[Message 102] Brenda: ""Carlos, did you see anyone else near 5.  Corrections Officer yesterday?""
[Message 103] Carlos: ""No! Just 5.  Corrections Officer and Ben, leaving.""
[Message 104] Ashley: ""Brenda, don't listen to him! He's lying!""
[Message 105] Brenda: ""Ashley, can you wait one minute, before calling the cops?""
[Message 106] Ashley: ""Fine, I am aware that you need time to process, but I am losing it here.""
[Message 107] Carlos: ""I can't believe this is happening.""
[Message 108] Brenda: ""Me neither. This is a nightmare. I can't sleep.""
[Message 109] Ashley: ""I'm so angry. I feel so sorry for 5.  Corrections Officer.""
[Message 110] Carlos: ""Yeah, it's terrible. Maybe I should just turn myself in.""
[Message 111] Brenda: ""Carlos! Don't be ridiculous!""
[Message 112] Ashley: ""Why would you do that if you're innocent?""
[Message 113] Carlos: ""I don't know! Maybe it's my fault for not telling anyone about Ben's hammer thing.""
[Message 114] Brenda: ""It's not your fault. But you need to tell the police.""
[Message 115] Ashley: ""Exactly. It's the right thing to do.""
[Message 116] Carlos: ""Okay, okay. I will. Tomorrow.""
[Message 117] Brenda: ""No, Carlos. Now. Go now.""

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, saw it on the news. Messed up.
[Message 3] Serena: Rest Area? What happened?
[Message 4] Kai: Two people dead. Pushed.
[Message 5] Serena: Oh my god, that’s awful! Who were they?
[Message 6] Liam: Name was Avery, the activist and another kid named Jordan, who worked as a social worker.
[Message 7] Serena: Jordan? I think I met them once... This is terrible.
[Message 8] Marcus: Crazy world, man. Anyway, Liam, you still in for that game tonight?
[Message 9] Liam: Yeah, definitely. Need to take my mind off things.
[Message 10] Kai: Marcus, you working today? Thought you had a meeting with Avery yesterday?
[Message 11] Marcus: Yeah, meeting went… sideways. Nothing major. Just disagreement over plans.
[Message 12] Kai: Plans? What kind of plans?
[Message 13] Marcus: Business stuff. You know how it is. Nothing to do with... this.
[Message 14] Serena: Marcus, were you at Rest Area yesterday Early Afternoon?
[Message 15] Marcus: No. I was at office. Why?
[Message 16] Serena: Just asking. This whole thing is unsettling.
[Message 17] Liam: You okay, Serena? You seem really shaken up.
[Message 18] Serena: I just… I knew Jordan. They were always so kind. Makes you think, you know?
[Message 19] Kai: Yeah, life's fragile. Makes me want to appreciate everyday
[Message 20] Angel: Anyone know if they caught the person who did it yet?
[Message 21] Liam: Not that I've heard. Probably reviewing CCTV.
[Message 22] Marcus: Hope they catch them soon. They are going away for a long time for this
[Message 23] Angel: I was supposed to meet Jordan for lunch today, that’s so sad.
[Message 24] Serena: Angel, did Jordan ever mention anything about feeling unsafe?
[Message 25] Angel: Not really, just the usual anxieties about the job. You know, social worker stuff.
[Message 26] Serena: Right.
[Message 27] Marcus: You guys talking about feeling unsafe? I saw Angel buying Pushing from a height at the hardware store yesterday. Thought it was weird.
[Message 28] Angel: I thought it was really insensitive to make such a joke, Marcus.
[Message 29] Angel: That's NOT funny, Marcus! I’m so distraught over Jordan’s death, I can’t believe you.
[Message 30] Marcus: Sorry, Angel. Didn't mean anything by it. Just trying to lighten the mood. Bad joke.
[Message 31] Kai: Maybe we should all just calm down. Speculation isn’t going to help.
[Message 32] Liam: Good point, Kai. Let's wait for the police to do their job.
[Message 33] Serena: Easy for you to say, Liam. You didn't know Jordan.
[Message 34] Liam: I understand, Serena. But getting worked up won't bring them back.
[Message 35] Angel: It's just... I can't believe someone would do something like that. Especially to Jordan.
[Message 36] Marcus: I can't stop thinking about that meeting with Avery. He always hated activist. He was stubborn and wouldn't budge on anything. If he hadn't fired Avery, none of this would have happened.
[Message 37] Kai: Fired? Avery was fired?
[Message 38] Marcus: Yeah, week before. That's what the meeting was about, finalising things.
[Message 39] Liam: See, Marcus? That's the kind of thing the police should know. You should tell them about the firing.
[Message 40] Marcus: I will. Just haven't had a chance yet. Still processing.

[Message 7] Alex: About what?
[Message 8] Ben: I don't know exactly. But people are talking.

[Message 10] Ben: Kai? What were they doing there so early?
[Message 11] Alex: Kai always works out at that time.
[Message 12] Ben: True. Heard anything from Jordan?
[Message 13] Alex: Nope. You?
[Message 14] Ben: Nothing. Kind of weird.
[Message 15] Alex: Maybe they’re just freaked out. Everyone is.
[Message 16] Ben: I guess so. Should we try to contact them?
[Message 17] Alex: Maybe later. Let’s give them some space.
[Message 18] Ben: Okay. What about getting lunch?
[Message 19] Alex: Sure, where at?
[Message 20] Ben: How about that new place downtown?
[Message 21] Alex: Sounds good. An hour?
[Message 22] Ben: Perfect. See you then.
[Message 23] Alex: Later.
[Message 24] Ben: BTW I saw Jordan buying an ice pick the other day. Odd, right?
[Message 25] Alex: Seriously? That is kinda weird. Where?
[Message 26] Ben: That hardware store on 6th. I thought nothing of it, but now…
[Message 27] Alex: Okay, now I'm concerned. Selena would never hurt somebody. But the ice pick is too crazy.
[Message 28] Ben: My thoughts exactly. Let’s not jump to conclusions though.
[Message 29] Alex: Right, right.
[Message 30] Kai: Hey guys, what's going on? You all good?
[Message 31] Ben: Just talking about the gym murder. Crazy, right?
[Message 32] Kai: Yeah, super messed up. I saw the whole thing. I saw Jordan leave the building at Predawn.
[Message 33] Alex: What?! You actually saw them? Was it after the incident?
[Message 34] Kai: Yeah, it was right after. They looked shaken.
[Message 35] Ben: Did you call the cops? This changes everything.
[Message 36] Kai: I freaked out, man. I didn’t know what to do. Just saw them running.
[Message 37] Alex: You should’ve called. That might’ve helped her survive.
[Message 38] Ben: Agreed. Kai, you gotta tell the cops.
[Message 39] Kai: I know, I know. I'm going to. I swear.
[Message 40] Alex: Good. Because this is serious. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 41] Ben: Agreed. We will go with you.
[Message 42] Kai: Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
[Message 43] Jordan: What's up? Why are you guys blowing up my phone?
[Message 44] Ben: We need to talk. Face to face.
[Message 45] Jordan: About what?
[Message 46] Alex: Don't play dumb, Jordan. About Selena.
[Message 47] Jordan: Look, I had nothing to do with that.
[Message 48] Ben: Kai saw you leaving the gym right after it happened.
[Message 49] Jordan: Kai is lying. I was home all night.
[Message 50] Alex: And Ben saw you buying an ice pick.
[Message 51] Jordan: It’s for my art project! Geez!
[Message 52] Ben: An ""art project"" that requires a Stabbing with an ice pick?
[Message 53] Jordan: Yes! Look, I'm not going to explain myself to you guys.
[Message 54] Alex: We’re just trying to understand, Jordan. 
[Message 55] Jordan: Understand what? That I’m being accused of something I didn’t do?
[Message 56] Ben: We just want the truth.
[Message 57] Jordan: I told you the truth!
[Message 58] Kai: Guys, can we all just calm down?
[Message 59] Alex: Easier said than done, Kai.
[Message 60] Ben: Yeah, someone’s dead.
[Message 61] Jordan: I know someone’s dead! And I feel terrible about it.
[Message 62] Alex: Did you know Selena well?
[Message 63] Jordan: Not really. We talked a few times at the gym.
[Message 64] Ben: What did you talk about?
[Message 65] Jordan: Just… gym stuff. Workouts, whatever.
[Message 66] Alex: Sounds like BS, Jordan.
[Message 67] Jordan: Look, believe what you want. I gotta go.
[Message 68] Ben: Don’t leave. We’re not done talking.
[Message 69] Jordan: Yes, we are. Bye.
[Message 70] Alex: Dammit.
[Message 71] Ben: They’re definitely hiding something.
[Message 72] Kai: Maybe we should call the cops.
[Message 73] Alex: Agreed. This is beyond us.
[Message 74] Ben: Let’s all go together.
[Message 75] Kai: Okay, meet at the police station in an hour?
[Message 76] Alex: Sounds good.
[Message 77] Ben: See you there.
[Message 78] Jordan: Fine. I'll talk to the cops too. But I swear, I didn't kill Selena.
[Message 79] Alex: Then why were you at the gym that early?
[Message 80] Jordan: I couldn't sleep. I went for a walk. Is that a crime?
[Message 81] Ben: A walk that leads you to the scene of a murder?
[Message 82] Jordan: It’s a coincidence!
[Message 83] Kai: You looked pretty panicked when you were leaving.
[Message 84] Jordan: Of course I was panicked! There were cops everywhere!
[Message 85] Alex: Did you see anyone else there?
[Message 86] Jordan: No! I just wanted to get away from the chaos.
[Message 87] Ben: What about around the activist?
[Message 88] Jordan: What is this, a freaking interrogation? I'm done talking to you guys until I talk to a lawyer.
[Message 89] Alex: Smart move.
[Message 90] Ben: See you at the station, then.
[Message 91] Kai: I still think we should have called when I first saw her leaving the scene.
[Message 92] Alex: I know, Kai. Don't beat yourself up.
[Message 93] Ben: What's done is done. Let's focus on getting justice for Selena.
[Message 94] Alex: Agreed.
[Message 95] Ben: I just can't believe this happened.
[Message 96] Alex: Me neither. Such a waste.
[Message 97] Kai: I was talking to Layla too, and she said that Layla hated Selena.
[Message 98] Alex: Layla? Why?
[Message 99] Kai: Because Selena was getting all the attention in the activist circles.
[Message 100] Ben: Jealousy? Seriously?
[Message 101] Alex: It's possible. People do crazy things.
[Message 102] Ben: I guess so. But an activist organization?
[Message 103] Kai: Yeah, but Layla is pretty intense. She’s always been a bit…off.
[Message 104] Alex: Off how?
[Message 105] Kai: Just… unpredictable. Has strong opinions, you know?
[Message 106] Ben: Alright, now we have two suspects.
[Message 107] Alex: More like two people we need to talk to the cops about.
[Message 108] Ben: Exactly.
[Message 109] Kai: Let's just focus on Selena. The police will figure it out.
[Message 110] Alex: True. But every piece of information helps.
[Message 111] Ben: Agreed.
[Message 112] Jordan: I just spoke to my lawyer. He said I don't have to talk to you guys anymore.
[Message 113] Alex: Good for you, Jordan.
[Message 114] Ben: It won’t save you if you’re guilty.
[Message 115] Jordan: I'm not guilty!
[Message 116] Kai: Guys, can we please stop arguing?
[Message 117] Alex: Fine. But I don't trust Jordan.
[Message 118] Ben: Me neither. But let's let the police do their job.
[Message 119] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 120] Alex: So, police station in half an hour?
[Message 121] Ben: Yep.
[Message 122] Kai: See you there.
[Message 123] Ben: I just remembered, Selena was about to expose Layla.
[Message 124] Alex: Expose her for what?
[Message 125] Ben: I don't know exactly, but it was something big. Selena intended to release it this week.
[Message 126] Alex: That's motive right there.
[Message 127] Kai: Well, that changes everything.
[Message 128] Alex: Let's tell the cops about this immediately.

[Message 4] Alex: Haha, send it over, David! We need a laugh.
[Message 5] Liam: Seconded! I need to take my mind off these ROI reports.
[Message 6] Maya: Speaking of ROI, did anyone see the article about Gen Z's spending habits? Super interesting.

[Message 13] Liam: Please share more throughout the night! It's keeping me awake.
[Message 14] Maya: Anyone else think the coffee machine is getting weaker?
[Message 15] David: You know, I think you're right, Maya. We might need a stronger brew.
[Message 16] Alex: Maybe we should pool our money and get a fancy espresso machine?
[Message 17] Liam: I'm in! Consider it a business expense... for morale.
[Message 18] Maya: I'm down. A decent espresso would be a game-changer.
[Message 19] David: I'll contribute. As long as someone else cleans it.
[Message 20] Alex: Deal! I'll even watch some YouTube tutorials on latte art.
[Message 21] Liam: Now you're talking! Marketing agency coffee, but make it aesthetic.

[Message 29] Liam: Pilot G2's are my go-to. Smooth writing and reliable.
[Message 30] Maya: I second that! Pilot G2s are the best.

[Message 20] BEN: Thanks for the info, Martha.

[Message 29] BEN: So, Martha told me you knew Rashad?
[Message 30] JESSICA: Yeah, vaguely. Worked together on a project once. Why?

[Message 32] JESSICA: Rashad? Seriously? He always seemed kind of...intense.
[Message 33] BEN: Intense how?
[Message 34] JESSICA: Just, passionate about his beliefs. Especially about social justice issues. Alex was involved in that stuff, too, right?
[Message 35] BEN: Yeah, I think so.

[Message 36] MARTHA: Do you think he would hurt someone? Rashad?
[Message 37] BEN: I don't know, Martha. People are unpredictable. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.

[Message 85] LIAM: Yeah! Looks amazing!

[Message 98] JESSICA: I'm thinking of volunteering at the animal shelter.
[Message 99] BEN: That's a great idea.

[Message 100] MARTHA: I need to get out of the house.
[Message 101] BEN: Go for a walk. Clear your head.

[Message 102] LIAM: You see anything about the Grocery Store case?
[Message 103] CHLOE: No, nothing new. Still under investigation, I guess.

[Message 104] BEN: Jessica, don't mention my name if the cops ask you about Dakota.
[Message 105] JESSICA: Why Ben? Are you hiding something?
[Message 106] BEN: It is for the best.
[Message 107] JESSICA: I dont like this Ben, I dont know what you know.

[Message 108] MARTHA: I heard that the manager saw someone leaving the store at Early Hours.
[Message 109] BEN: Someone specific? Did they give a description?
[Message 110] MARTHA: No, just that they saw someone leaving in a hurry.

[Message 111] CHLOE: I think I need a vacation.
[Message 112] LIAM: Me too. Somewhere far away.

[Message 113] JESSICA: You're scaring me, Ben. I'm calling the police if you don't tell me what's going on.
[Message 114] BEN: Don't do that! Just trust me. It's complicated.

[Message 115] MARTHA: The police are looking for witnesses.
[Message 116] BEN: I hope they find someone who saw something.

[Message 117] CHLOE: What do you think about getting a dog?
[Message 118] LIAM: I've always wanted one!

[Message 119] JESSICA: Complicated how, Ben? Someone needs to call 911 after the victim was hurt. This makes you an accessory.
[Message 120] BEN: It doesn't involve me directly, okay? Just...be careful what you say.

[Message 121] MARTHA: I keep having nightmares.
[Message 122] BEN: Try some herbal tea before bed. It might help.

[Message 123] CHLOE: Do you have any good recipes?
[Message 124] LIAM: I make a killer pasta sauce.

[Message 125] JESSICA: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened
[Message 126] BEN: That's just speculation, Jessica.

[Message 127] MARTHA: I wonder if Alex suffered.
[Message 128] BEN: I hope not, Martha. I really hope not.

[Message 129] CHLOE: What are you doing this weekend?
[Message 130] LIAM: Probably just chilling at home.

[Message 131] JESSICA: I'm going to the police, Ben. I can't live with this.
[Message 132] BEN: Don't! You'll regret it. I'm serious, Jessica.

[Message 133] MARTHA: This whole thing is so senseless.
[Message 134] BEN: It is. Absolutely senseless.

[Message 135] CHLOE: Any plans for Halloween?
[Message 136] LIAM: Still figuring it out.

[Message 137] JESSICA: What are you threatening me, Ben?
[Message 138] BEN: Just looking out for you.

[Message 139] MARTHA: I can't sleep.
[Message 140] BEN: Maybe try listening to some calming music.

[Message 141] CHLOE: I need to go shopping soon.
[Message 142] LIAM: Always a good idea!

[Message 143] JESSICA: The more you say, the more suspicious I get.
[Message 144] BEN: It's not what you think.

[Message 145] MARTHA: This is all so unreal.
[Message 146] BEN: I know.

[Message 147] CHLOE: Did you see that crazy lightning last night?
[Message 148] LIAM: Almost took out my power!

[Message 149] JESSICA: I'm done talking to you, Ben.
[Message 150] BEN: Jessica, please don't do anything rash.

[Message 151] MARTHA: I hope they find the person responsible.
[Message 152] BEN: Me too. More than anything.

[Message 153] CHLOE: What's your favorite color?
[Message 154] LIAM: Blue, always.

[Message 155] BEN: Fine, do what you want. But don't say I didn't warn you.

[Message 156] MARTHA: Maybe I'll go to the memorial service.
[Message 157] BEN: That's a good idea, Martha.

[Message 158] CHLOE: I'm so tired.
[Message 159] LIAM: Me too. Long day.

[Message 160] BEN: If you mention me, tell them I was home all night.
[Message 161] JESSICA: Ben, this is not good.
[Message 162] BEN: It is what it is, Jessica.

[Message 163] MARTHA: This whole thing is so devastating.
[Message 164] BEN: It is.

[Message 165] CHLOE: Want to grab coffee tomorrow?
[Message 166] LIAM: Definitely!

[Message 167] BEN: I knew it would get back to me eventually.
[Message 168] JESSICA: I can't do this anymore, I'm scared.

[Message 169] MARTHA: I feel so helpless.
[Message 170] BEN: I know. It's a terrible feeling.

[Message 171] CHLOE: I'm going to try and get some sleep.
[Message 172] LIAM: Me too. Goodnight!

[Message 173] BEN: I can't believe what I did. I feel terrible.
[Message 174] JESSICA: You did something?

[Message 175] MARTHA: I'm going to light a candle for Alex.
[Message 176] BEN: That's a beautiful thing to do.

[Message 177] CHLOE: Talk to you later.
[Message 178] LIAM: Sounds good!

[Message 179] BEN: Don't tell anyone what you know.
[Message 180] JESSICA: I'm telling everyone! You're going to jail!

[Message 181] MARTHA: I can't stop thinking about it.
[Message 182] BEN: I know. It's hard to stop.

[Message 183] CHLOE: Bye!
[Message 184] LIAM: See ya!

[Message 185] BEN: It was an accident!
[Message 186] JESSICA: Ben, you did this!

[Message 187] MARTHA: This is so sad.

[Message 27] Alex: ""True that! I'm going to water my plants while I wait. They're probably loving this humidity.""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""Good idea! Mine are probably thrilled. Though, one of them is always dramatic and wilting.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""We all have that one dramatic plant friend. What kind is it?""
[Message 30] Jamie: ""It's a peace lily. Very sensitive to everything.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Ah, the classic peace lily drama queen. They're beautiful, though!""
[Message 32] Jamie: ""They are! When they're not fainting from thirst.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Haha! Mine's a fern. Pretty low-maintenance, thankfully.""
[Message 34] Jamie: ""Ferns are good! I might need to get one. Low-maintenance is my speed.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Highly recommend. Okay, plant update complete. Still drizzling…""
[Message 36] Jamie: ""Ugh. Maybe we should just postpone coffee until tomorrow?""
[Message 37] Alex: ""That's an option. Tomorrow's supposed to be sunny, I think.""
[Message 38] Jamie: ""Yeah, I saw that too. A sunny tomorrow sounds divine.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""It really does. Okay, tomorrow it is! We'll celebrate escaping the spreadsheets and the humidity.""
[Message 40] Jamie: ""Perfect plan! I'm in. What time tomorrow?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""How about around 2 pm? That gives us both time to recover from… everything.""
[Message 42] Jamie: ""2 pm works great for me. I'll set a reminder.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Awesome! I'm looking forward to it.""
[Message 44] Jamie: ""Me too! This spreadsheet is finally cooperating, by the way.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Hallelujah! You defeated the beast!""
[Message 46] Jamie: ""I did! With the power of caffeine deprivation and sheer stubbornness.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""A potent combination! You deserve a medal.""
[Message 48] Jamie: ""I'll settle for a good night's sleep. And tomorrow's latte.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Fair enough. Sleep well!""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""You too! Talk to you tomorrow.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Sounds good. Bye!""
[Message 52] Jamie: ""Bye!""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Hey, did you see that article about the new art exhibit downtown?""
[Message 54] Jamie: ""No, I haven't! What's it about?""
[Message 55] Alex: ""It's a collection of abstract paintings inspired by nature. Apparently, it's pretty cool.""
[Message 56] Jamie: ""Ooh, that sounds interesting. Maybe we could check it out sometime?""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Definitely! We could make it a post-coffee outing tomorrow.""
[Message 58] Jamie: ""That's a great idea! I'm in.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Awesome! It'll be like a double dose of art and caffeine.""
[Message 60] Jamie: ""My two favorite things! Except maybe spreadsheets...""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Haha! Okay, fair. Spreadsheets have their place.""
[Message 62] Jamie: ""A very small place, tucked away in the darkest corner of my hard drive.""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Precisely! Speaking of corners, I need to tidy up mine. My craft supplies are multiplying.""
[Message 64] Jamie: ""Oh, I know that feeling. My drawing supplies have taken over half my desk.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""It's a constant battle, isn't it? Between creativity and chaos.""
[Message 66] Jamie: ""Absolutely! But I wouldn't have it any other way.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""Me neither. A little organized chaos is good for the soul.""
[Message 68] Jamie: ""Agreed! It keeps things interesting.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""So true. Okay, back to tidying! Wish me luck.""
[Message 70] Jamie: ""Good luck! May your craft supplies be easily contained.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Thanks! I'll need it.""
[Message 72] Jamie: ""So, about the art exhibit...do you know the artist's name?""
[Message 73] Alex: ""I think it's…Elena Ramirez? I can double-check the article.""
[Message 74] Jamie: ""Okay, no worries. I can look it up too. Just curious.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""Yeah, I can send you the link if you want.""
[Message 76] Jamie: ""Sure, that would be great!""
[Message 77] Alex: ""[Link to art exhibit article]""
[Message 78] Jamie: ""Thanks! I'll check it out.""
[Message 79] Alex: ""No problem! Let me know what you think.""
[Message 80] Jamie: ""Will do! Okay, gotta get back to adulting for a bit. Laundry calls.""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Ugh, laundry. The eternal struggle.""
[Message 82] Jamie: ""Tell me about it! It never ends.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Nope. It just keeps piling up, mocking us.""
[Message 84] Jamie: ""Exactly! Okay, wish me luck on this domestic adventure.""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Good luck, my friend! May your socks find their matches.""
[Message 86] Jamie: ""Haha! That's the dream. Talk to you later!""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Later!""
[Message 88] Alex: ""Hey, random thought: have you ever tried making your own laundry detergent?""
[Message 89] Jamie: ""DIY laundry detergent? That sounds...intense. Is it even effective?""
[Message 90] Alex: ""I've heard it is! And it's supposed to be more eco-friendly.""
[Message 91] Jamie: ""Hmm, interesting. I might have to look into that.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""Yeah, I saw a recipe online using baking soda, washing soda, and essential oils.""
[Message 93] Jamie: ""Essential oils in laundry detergent? Fancy!""
[Message 94] Alex: ""Right? Apparently, it makes your clothes smell amazing.""
[Message 95] Jamie: ""Okay, you're selling me on this. I'm intrigued.""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Haha! I might try it this weekend. If I do, I'll let you know how it goes.""
[Message 97] Jamie: ""Please do! I'm living vicariously through your laundry adventures.""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Will do! Okay, back to my own cleaning spree. This place is a disaster zone.""

335,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey, did you hear about what happened at the bus terminal?
[Message 2] Ben: No, what's up?
[Message 3] Alex: Two people were killed. Brutal.
[Message 4] Ben: Seriously? That's awful.
[Message 5] Casey: I saw it on the news. Crazy.
[Message 6] Alex: Yeah, the news said it was the 5.  Corrections Officer and a social worker.
[Message 7] Ben: A Corrections Officer and a social worker? Weird combo.
[Message 8] Casey: I know, right? Makes you wonder what was going on.
[Message 9] Alex: Police are looking for any leads.
[Message 10] Ben: I hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 11] Casey: Me too. It's scary to think that could happen anywhere.
[Message 12] Alex: So, what are you guys up to tonight?
[Message 13] Ben: Just chilling at home. Watching a movie.
[Message 14] Casey: Same here. Early night for me.
[Message 15] Alex: Cool. I might head to bed early too.
[Message 16] Ben: Good idea. Get some rest.
[Message 17] Casey: Night guys.
[Message 18] Alex: Night.
[Message 19] Ben: Night.
[Message 20] Alex: Did either of you know the victims?
[Message 21] Ben: I don't think so. 5.  Corrections Officer? Social worker? Doesn't ring a bell.
[Message 22] Casey: Nope. Never heard of them.
[Message 23] Alex: Okay, just checking.
[Message 24] Ben: Why, did you?
[Message 25] Alex: I might have seen the 5.  Corrections Officer around once or twice. I go through the bus terminal a lot.
[Message 26] Ben: Oh, okay.
[Message 27] Casey: Makes sense.
[Message 28] Alex: Yeah.
[Message 29] Ben: Still can't believe something like that happened.
[Message 30] Casey: It's unsettling.
[Message 31] Alex: Totally.
[Message 32] Ben: Well, I'm gonna go make some popcorn.
[Message 33] Casey: Enjoy!
[Message 34] Alex: Have a good movie.
[Message 35] Ben: Thanks!
[Message 36] Casey: Anyone else think the bus terminal is kinda creepy at night?
[Message 37] Alex: Yeah, definitely. Especially now.
[Message 38] Ben: Probably always been a little sketchy.
[Message 39] Casey: True.
[Message 40] Alex: Have you guys seen any strange activity in the past few days?
[Message 41] Ben: Not really. Just the usual weirdos.
[Message 42] Casey: Nothing out of the ordinary for me either.
[Message 43] Alex: Okay.
[Message 44] Ben: Why do you ask?
[Message 45] Alex: Just curious. Figured someone might have seen something that could help the police.
[Message 46] Casey: Good point.
[Message 47] Ben: Maybe we should all be a little more observant.
[Message 48] Casey: Definitely.
[Message 49] Alex: Agreed.
[Message 50] Ben: I'm gonna try to remember if I saw anything relevant.
[Message 51] Casey: Same here.
[Message 52] Alex: Thanks, guys.
[Message 53] Ben: No problem.
[Message 54] Casey: Anytime.
[Message 55] Alex: This is so messed up. Two lives just gone.
[Message 56] Ben: Absolutely.
[Message 57] Casey: Makes you think.
[Message 58] Alex: About what?
[Message 59] Casey: Just how fragile life is.
[Message 60] Ben: True.
[Message 61] Alex: So true.
[Message 62] Ben: Anyway, back to my movie.
[Message 63] Casey: Enjoy!
[Message 64] Alex: Later.
[Message 65] Ben: Later.
[Message 66] Casey: Later
[Message 67] Alex: I heard the victims were named David (Corrections Officer) and Michael (Social Worker).
[Message 68] Ben: David and Michael, huh? Still doesn't ring a bell.
[Message 69] Casey: Nope.
[Message 70] Alex: Maybe someone who used the bus terminal regularly would recognize them.
[Message 71] Ben: Possibly.
[Message 72] Casey: Yeah, maybe.
[Message 73] Alex: The news said Michael was really ambitious.
[Message 74] Ben: Ambitious? How so?
[Message 75] Casey: What do you mean?
[Message 76] Alex: Like, he was trying to climb the corporate ladder fast. Maybe someone was jealous.
[Message 77] Ben: That's a possibility.
[Message 78] Casey: Could be.
[Message 79] Alex: And David, they said he was pretty carefree.
[Message 80] Ben: Carefree? Could have made enemies easily.
[Message 81] Casey: Maybe stepped on some toes.
[Message 82] Alex: Exactly.
[Message 83] Ben: I wonder if they knew each other.
[Message 84] Casey: Good question.
[Message 85] Alex: The police must be looking into that.
[Message 86] Ben: Hopefully.
[Message 87] Casey: Yeah.
[Message 88] Alex: I'm going to try and get some sleep.
[Message 89] Ben: Okay, goodnight.
[Message 90] Casey: Sweet dreams.
[Message 91] Alex: Thanks. Night.
[Message 92] Ben: Night.
[Message 93] Casey: Night.
[Message 94] Ben: Anyone know what Electrocution costs these days?
[Message 95] Alex: Why do you ask, Ben?
[Message 96] Casey: Yeah, that's a random question.
[Message 97] Ben: Just curious. Need to fix something at home.
[Message 98] Alex: Oh, okay. I think it depends on the type.
[Message 99] Casey: Yeah, and where you buy it.
[Message 100] Ben: True.
[Message 101] Alex: I'm still thinking about David. A Corrections Officer.
[Message 102] Ben: Yeah, it's a tough job.
[Message 103] Casey: He probably dealt with some rough people.
[Message 104] Alex: He could have crossed the wrong person.
[Message 105] Ben: Definitely a possibility.
[Message 106] Casey: Makes you wonder if it was work-related.
[Message 107] Alex: That's what I was thinking.
[Message 108] Ben: The police will figure it out.
[Message 109] Casey: Hopefully soon.
[Message 110] Alex: I just hope they didn’t suffer.
[Message 111] Ben: Me too.
[Message 112] Casey: Absolutely.
[Message 113] Alex: What are you guys doing tomorrow?
[Message 114] Ben: Just running some errands.
[Message 115] Casey: I have a doctor's appointment.
[Message 116] Alex: Okay.
[Message 117] Ben: Nothing exciting.
[Message 118] Casey: Nope.
[Message 119] Alex: Well, have a good day.
[Message 120] Ben: You too.
[Message 121] Casey: Thanks.
[Message 122] Alex: Later.
[Message 123] Ben: Later.
[Message 124] Casey: Later.
[Message 125] Ben: I heard a rumor that David had it out for someone at work. 
[Message 126] Alex: Oh really? Who?
[Message 127] Casey: Spill the tea.
[Message 128] Ben: Something about a disagreement over work policy, escalating into threats.
[Message 129] Alex: Wow. That could be it.
[Message 130] Casey: Definitely sounds like a motive.
[Message 131] Alex: The police should look into that immediately.
[Message 132] Ben: They probably are.
[Message 133] Casey: You'd hope so.
[Message 134] Alex: This is getting more twisted by the minute.
[Message 135] Ben: Tell me about it.
[Message 136] Casey: Crazy.
[Message 137] Alex: I'm going to read a book and try to relax.
[Message 138] Ben: Good idea.
[Message 139] Casey: Enjoy.
[Message 140] Alex: Thanks.
[Message 141] Ben: Later.
[Message 142] Casey: Night.
[Message 143] Alex: Night.
[Message 144] Ben: Night.
[Message 145] Casey: I saw Ben leave the building at Dead of Night.
[Message 146] Alex: Really? You saw Ben at the bus terminal?
[Message 147] Ben: What the hell are you talking about, Casey? I was at home all night.
[Message 148] Casey: I'm just saying what I saw.
[Message 149] Alex: Casey, are you sure it was Ben?
[Message 150] Ben: This is insane. Why would I be there?
[Message 151] Casey: It was dark, but I'm pretty sure it was you.
[Message 152] Alex: Ben, were you anywhere near the bus terminal last night?
[Message 153] Ben: No! I swear, I was at home watching a movie. Ask my neighbor.
[Message 154] Casey: Maybe I’m mistaken. It was dark out.
[Message 155] Alex: This is getting weird.
[Message 156] Ben: You think?! I'm being accused of murder!
[Message 157] Casey: I didn't say you were the murderer.
[Message 158] Alex: Okay, everyone calm down.
[Message 159] Ben: I'm perfectly calm. I just don't appreciate being falsely accused.
[Message 160] Casey: Like I said, maybe I’m mistaken.
[Message 161] Alex: Maybe it's best if we don't speculate anymore.
[Message 162] Ben: Agreed.
[Message 163] Casey: Whatever.
[Message 164] Alex: The police will figure it out.
[Message 165] Ben: Let's hope so. Before I get framed.
[Message 166] Casey: Just trying to help.
[Message 167] Alex: I know, Casey. Thanks.
[Message 168] Ben: Right. Thanks.
[Message 169] Casey: No problem.

[Message 174] Ben: Night.
[Message 175] Casey: Night.
[Message 176] Ben: Alex, did you ever find out anything more about Michael?
[Message 177] Alex: Not really. Just that he was ambitious and some people might not have liked that. Why?
[Message 178] Ben: No reason. Just curious.
[Message 179] Casey: Still trying to solve the case, Ben?
[Message 180] Ben: Just making conversation, Casey.
[Message 181] Alex: Guys, let's just drop it, okay?
[Message 182] Ben: Fine by me.
[Message 183] Casey: Whatever you say, Alex.
[Message 184] Alex: Thanks.
[Message 185] Ben: So, anyone watching anything good on TV tonight?
[Message 186] Casey: Not really. Just catching up on the news.
[Message 187] Alex: Same here.
[Message 188] Ben: Maybe I'll find something on streaming.
[Message 189] Casey: Worth a shot.

[Message 28] David: I have a whole garden in my backyard. Keeps me busy.
[Message 29] Agnes: I just have a few houseplants. I’m not very good with plants.
[Message 30] Ben: It's all about the right soil and watering schedule.
[Message 31] Chloe: True! And sunlight, of course.
[Message 32] David: Don't overwater! That's the biggest mistake people make.
[Message 33] Agnes: Noted! Thanks for the tips.
[Message 34] Ben: So, back to fitness, anyone tried those HIIT workouts?
[Message 35] Chloe: HIIT is brutal but effective! I do them sometimes.
[Message 36] David: HIIT? Sounds a bit too intense for me.
[Message 37] Agnes: I tried one once and nearly died.
[Message 38] Ben: Haha, yeah, they're not for everyone.
[Message 39] Chloe: Start slow! There are beginner versions.
[Message 40] David: I think I'll stick to my walks. Less chance of cardiac arrest.
[Message 41] Agnes: Agreed! Walking sounds much safer.
[Message 42] Ben: Anyone have any good workout playlists? I'm getting bored with mine.
[Message 43] Chloe: I mostly listen to pop music when I run. Keeps me energized.
[Message 44] David: I prefer podcasts. Educational and entertaining.
[Message 45] Agnes: I like classical music. Very calming.
[Message 46] Ben: Classical music for working out? Interesting choice!
[Message 47] Chloe: Whatever works, right?
[Message 48] David: Exactly. Whatever keeps you moving.
[Message 49] Agnes: Makes the workout seem less awful.
[Message 50] Ben: True that.
[Message 51] Chloe: So, anyone else feeling like they need a vacation?
[Message 52] David: Always.
[Message 53] Agnes: Definitely. Somewhere warm.
[Message 54] Ben: Yeah, I could use a beach.
[Message 55] Chloe: Me too!
[Message 56] David: Back to reality though...eye exams!
[Message 57] Agnes: Yep, gotta take care of these peepers.
[Message 58] Ben: True. Vision is important.
[Message 59] Chloe: Especially with all that screen time.
[Message 60] David: Absolutely. Prevention is key.
[Message 61] Agnes: Speaking of prevention, did anyone get their flu shot this year?
[Message 62] Ben: Yep, got mine last month.
[Message 63] Chloe: I got mine too. Don't want to get sick.
[Message 64] David: Good call. I should probably schedule mine.
[Message 65] Agnes: Definitely do it. It's worth it.
[Message 66] Ben: Agreed. Being sick is the worst.
[Message 67] Chloe: Especially during the holidays.
[Message 68] David: Exactly. No one wants to be sick during the holidays.
[Message 69] Agnes: So, anyone have any big plans for the holidays?
[Message 70] Ben: Not really. Just spending time with family.
[Message 71] Chloe: Same here. Low-key and relaxing.
[Message 72] David: We're hosting a small gathering.
[Message 73] Agnes: That sounds nice, David.
[Message 74] Ben: Yeah, that sounds fun.
[Message 75] Chloe: I'm looking forward to some good food.
[Message 76] David: Always a highlight of the holidays.
[Message 77] Agnes: Agreed!
[Message 78] Ben: What's everyone's favorite holiday food?
[Message 79] Chloe: Pie! All kinds of pie.
[Message 80] David: Turkey with all the fixings.
[Message 81] Agnes: Ham. Definitely ham.
[Message 82] Ben: Classic choices!
[Message 83] Chloe: Can't go wrong with the classics.
[Message 84] David: Nope. Always a winner.
[Message 85] Agnes: So, anyone have any job interviews coming up?
[Message 86] Ben: Actually, I do! Next week. Wish me luck!
[Message 87] Chloe: Good luck, Ben! You'll do great.
[Message 88] David: Best of luck, Ben. Prepare your answers!
[Message 89] Agnes: Good luck! What kind of job is it?
[Message 90] Ben: Thanks everyone! It's a supervisor position at another customer service center.
[Message 91] Chloe: Wow, that's a big step up!
[Message 92] David: Congratulations, Ben. Sounds promising.
[Message 93] Agnes: That's fantastic! I'm sure you'll ace it.
[Message 94] Ben: I hope so! I'm a bit nervous.
[Message 95] Chloe: Just be yourself and highlight your strengths.
[Message 96] David: And remember to ask questions! Shows you're engaged.
[Message 97] Agnes: Exactly. Do your research on the company too.
[Message 98] Ben: Great advice, everyone! I appreciate it.
[Message 99] Chloe: Anytime!
[Message 100] David: Glad to help.
[Message 101] Agnes: Yeah, good luck again!
[Message 102] Ben: Thanks again. Well, I think that's my name being called. Wish me luck one last time!
[Message 103] Chloe: Good luck, Ben! Go get 'em!

[Message 2] Jamie: Aww, thanks Alex! You too! That shirt is a great color on you.
[Message 3] Taylor: Thanks, both of you! I actually just picked it up. Comfort is key these days.
[Message 4] Alex: Definitely! Where'd you get it, Taylor?
[Message 5] Taylor: Just at that little boutique downtown, ""Threads of Time."" You know, the one with all the vintage stuff?
[Message 6] Jamie: Oh yeah! I've been meaning to check that place out.
[Message 7] Alex: You should! They have some really cool stuff. And Taylor's right, it's all about comfort lately.
[Message 8] Jamie: Absolutely. Speaking of comfortable, has anyone seen that new season of ""Cozy Cottage Mysteries""?
[Message 9] Taylor: Not yet! Is it any good?
[Message 10] Jamie: It's hilarious! The plot is ridiculous, but the characters are so charming.
[Message 11] Alex: I'm more of a nature documentary person myself, but I appreciate a good cozy mystery!
[Message 12] Taylor: Alex, you always have the best photography recommendations.
[Message 13] Alex: Thanks, Taylor! I'm actually planning a trip to Yosemite soon. Any of you been?
[Message 14] Jamie: Yosemite? Wow! I've always wanted to go.
[Message 15] Taylor: Me too! The pictures are breathtaking.
[Message 16] Alex: I'm going with my friend, Susan. We're really looking forward to it.
[Message 17] Jamie: That sounds amazing! Make sure to take lots of pictures.
[Message 18] Taylor: Yes! And share them with us!
[Message 19] Alex: Of course! I'll document the whole thing. Susan is already planning our itinerary.
[Message 20] Jamie: It's always good to have a planner in the group.
[Message 21] Taylor: Definitely! I tend to just wander aimlessly, which isn't always the best strategy.
[Message 22] Alex: I'm a little bit of both, to be honest. I like having a general idea, but I also like to leave room for spontaneity.
[Message 23] Jamie: That's a good balance.
[Message 24] Taylor: Agreed! So, back to compliments – Alex, I love your glasses. They're really stylish.
[Message 25] Alex: Oh, thank you, Taylor! I got them online.
[Message 26] Jamie: They suit you really well.
[Message 27] Alex: Thanks, Jamie!
[Message 28] Taylor: Okay, Jamie, your hair is looking particularly good today. What's your secret?
[Message 29] Jamie: Haha, no secret! Just a good haircut, I guess. Thanks!
[Message 30] Alex: You definitely have good hair genetics!
[Message 31] Jamie: I'll take that compliment! Thanks!
[Message 32] Taylor: Alright, alright, enough about us! Let's give some love to the school's new landscaping.
[Message 33] Alex: You're right! The flowers are beautiful this year.
[Message 34] Jamie: They really are. It makes the hallway look so much nicer.
[Message 35] Taylor: Makes coming to school slightly more bearable.
[Message 36] Alex: Haha, true!
[Message 37] Jamie: Speaking of bearable, anyone want to grab coffee after class?
[Message 38] Taylor: I'm in!
[Message 39] Alex: I could use a caffeine boost. Count me in.
[Message 40] Jamie: Awesome! My treat.
[Message 41] Taylor: You're the best, Jamie!
[Message 42] Alex: Seriously, thanks!
[Message 43] Jamie: No problem! Just happy to hang out with you guys.
[Message 44] Taylor: Same here! This hallway is way better with friends.
[Message 45] Alex: Agreed!
[Message 46] Jamie: Okay, quick question. What's everyone's favorite type of coffee?
[Message 47] Taylor: I'm a simple latte kind of person.
[Message 48] Alex: I like a good Americano.
[Message 49] Jamie: I usually go for a cappuccino.
[Message 50] Taylor: We're all pretty basic coffee drinkers, huh?
[Message 51] Alex: I guess so! Nothing wrong with the classics.
[Message 52] Jamie: True! It’s about the company, not just the coffee.
[Message 53] Taylor: Exactly!
[Message 54] Alex: Okay, before we totally derail this compliment thread, I have to say, Taylor, you always have such a positive attitude. It's really inspiring.
[Message 55] Taylor: Aww, thanks, Alex! I try my best.
[Message 56] Jamie: Yeah, Taylor, you're a ray of sunshine.
[Message 57] Taylor: You guys are making me blush!
[Message 58] Alex: It's true though!
[Message 59] Jamie: Totally! Okay, Alex, I admire your dedication to photography. It's a really cool hobby.
[Message 60] Alex: Thanks, Jamie! I find it really relaxing.
[Message 61] Taylor: I've seen some of your photos, Alex, they're amazing!
[Message 62] Alex: Thank you! I appreciate that.
[Message 63] Jamie: You should sell them!
[Message 64] Alex: I've thought about it, but I mostly do it for myself.
[Message 65] Taylor: That's fair!
[Message 66] Jamie: Alright, last compliment round! Taylor, your style is always on point.
[Message 67] Taylor: Aw, thanks, Jamie! Fashion is my happy place.
[Message 68] Alex: You always look so put-together.
[Message 69] Taylor: I try! It helps me feel confident.
[Message 70] Jamie: Okay, Alex, your ability to balance work and hobbies is impressive.
[Message 71] Alex: It's a juggling act, but I manage. Thanks, Jamie!
[Message 72] Taylor: You make it look easy!
[Message 73] Alex: It's definitely not always easy!
[Message 74] Jamie: And finally, Taylor, I appreciate your kindness and willingness to help others.
[Message 75] Taylor: That's so sweet of you to say, Jamie.
[Message 76] Alex: Yeah, you're always there for everyone.
[Message 77] Taylor: I just try to be a good person.
[Message 78] Jamie: You succeed!
[Message 79] Alex: Absolutely!
[Message 80] Jamie: Okay, guys, enough mushy stuff! Let's get to class.
[Message 81] Taylor: Agreed! Coffee soon, though!
[Message 82] Alex: Definitely! See you both there.
[Message 83] Jamie: Sounds good!
[Message 84] Taylor: Bye!
[Message 85] Alex: Bye!
[Message 86] Jamie: Has anyone seen my keys?
[Message 87] Taylor: Check your bag!
[Message 88] Alex: Or your pockets?
[Message 89] Jamie: I checked both! I swear they were just here.
[Message 90] Taylor: Maybe you left them in your locker?
[Message 91] Jamie: Oh my gosh, you're right! I'm so forgetful.
[Message 92] Alex: Happens to the best of us.
[Message 93] Taylor: Go get them! We'll wait.

[Message 4] Kai: ""Murdered. Garroted, apparently.""
[Message 5] Jamie: ""I can't believe it. She seemed so nice.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""I saw her there just yesterday. Anyone know any details?""
[Message 7] Kai: ""Just what I read online. Police haven't released much.""
[Message 8] Jamie: ""So scary. I was thinking of applying for a job there.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Maybe hold off on that for a bit. ""
[Message 10] Kai: ""Good call, Alex. Speaking of jobs, how's the writing going?""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Slow. Inspiration's been lacking.""

[Message 14] Jamie: ""Owen who?""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Owen Miller. I think he worked there a while back. Why?""
[Message 16] Kai: ""Just curious. He looked upset.""
[Message 17] Jamie: ""Maybe he knew Melissa well. I heard she fired people sometimes.""
[Message 18] Alex: ""Possible. He's always seemed a bit…intense.""
[Message 19] Kai: ""Intense how?""
[Message 20] Alex: ""Just…passionate about his beliefs, I guess.""

[Message 26] Alex: ""Gotta run. Talk soon.""
[Message 27] Kai: ""So, Jamie, you knew Melissa? What did you think of her?""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""Just met her a couple of times. She seemed really ambitious, wanted to climb the ladder fast. A lot of pressure on her, I think.""
[Message 29] Kai: ""Interesting. Did she seem to have any enemies?""
[Message 30] Jamie: ""Not that I could tell. But you never know, right? Someone might have been jealous.""
[Message 31] Kai: ""True. This whole thing is just unsettling. Hope they catch the killer soon.""
[Message 32] Jamie: ""Me too. This town's getting scary.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Hey, did you guys see that article about the coffee shop? They mentioned the garrote. That's messed up.""
[Message 34] Kai: ""Yeah, I saw. How did they know it was that?""
[Message 35] Jamie: ""Police must have leaked it. Bad form.""

[Message 37] Kai: ""True. Speaking of not telling, anyone hear from Owen? He's usually all over social media.""

[Message 39] Alex: ""Or maybe he's laying low. Just saying.""
[Message 40] Kai: ""Laying low why?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""I don't know! Just a thought. He always hated 1.  Law Enforcement Officer, from what I've heard.""
[Message 42] Jamie: ""That's a strong statement, Alex.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Well, I heard them arguing once about some regulations. It got heated.""

[Message 67] Jamie: ""Do you really think so? This is getting out of hand.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""I'm not saying she did, just trying to consider all angles. If the manager wasn't so quick to fire people, we wouldn't be having this conversation.""

[Message 2] Jamie: Yup! Just grabbed a coffee. You running late?
[Message 3] Alex: A little, sorry! The bus was packed. Be there in like 10.
[Message 4] Jamie: No worries! I'll save you a seat. So, ready for funny story time?
[Message 5] Alex: Born ready! I've got a doozy from this morning already.
[Message 6] Jamie: Ooh, spill! While I wait.
[Message 7] Alex: Okay, so picture this: Trying to mentor our new intern, Mark…
[Message 8] Jamie: Already sounds like a recipe for disaster. Bless your soul.
[Message 9] Alex: You have no idea. I was explaining Excel shortcuts…
[Message 10] Jamie: The bane of everyone’s existence.
[Message 11] Alex: Exactly! And he types “Ctrl + Alt + Delete” to copy something.
[Message 12] Jamie: *dies laughing* No way! Seriously?
[Message 13] Alex: Seriously! I almost choked on my water.
[Message 14] Jamie: Oh my god, that’s amazing. I feel for you, but also, hilarious.
[Message 15] Alex: Right? I had to walk away for a second.
[Message 16] Jamie: Reminds me of when I tried to teach my grandma how to use email.
[Message 17] Alex: Oh lord, I can only imagine.
[Message 18] Jamie: She thought the “@” symbol was a fancy “A”.
[Message 19] Alex: That's kind of adorable, actually.
[Message 20] Jamie: It was! But explaining it took like half an hour.
[Message 21] Alex: I’m here! Saw you. Coffee smells amazing.
[Message 22] Jamie: Finally! Okay, you have to tell that Excel story again, but with all the details.
[Message 23] Alex: Alright, alright. So, Mark, bless his heart…
[Message 24] Jamie: (Sipping coffee) Ready. Begin.
[Message 25] Alex: ...and then he says, with a perfectly straight face, “Ctrl + Alt + Delete to copy!”
[Message 26] Jamie: (Laughing again) I can't! He’s got potential. Bad potential.
[Message 27] Alex: He does! I think he'll be a good accountant eventually, but...we have a ways to go.
[Message 28] Jamie: My story involves a fishing trip gone wrong.
[Message 29] Alex: Ooh, I'm intrigued.
[Message 30] Jamie: So, I’m out on the lake last weekend…
[Message 31] Alex: Perfect day for it, weather was amazing.
[Message 32] Jamie: Exactly! And I finally get a bite. BIG one.
[Message 33] Alex: Oh, suspense!
[Message 34] Jamie: I'm reeling it in, thinking ""dinner is served!""
[Message 35] Alex: And...?
[Message 36] Jamie: It was my own hat.
[Message 37] Alex: (Bursts out laughing) You're kidding!
[Message 38] Jamie: I wish I was! I'd lost it earlier and didn't realize it.
[Message 39] Alex: The universe has a sense of humor, apparently.
[Message 40] Jamie: A cruel one, yes. All that effort for a soggy hat.
[Message 41] Alex: Did anyone see you?
[Message 42] Jamie: Thankfully, no. Just the seagulls judging me.
[Message 43] Alex: Seagulls are always judging. It's their job.
[Message 44] Jamie: True. Hey, quick question – you remember that new baking gadget I was looking at?
[Message 45] Alex: The one with the automatic frosting dispenser? Vaguely.
[Message 46] Jamie: Yeah, think I'm gonna bite the bullet and order it.
[Message 47] Alex: Do it! You deserve a little baking luxury.
[Message 48] Jamie: You're right. Treat myself!
[Message 49] Alex: What are you planning on baking next?
[Message 50] Jamie: I was thinking maybe a lemon meringue pie.
[Message 51] Alex: Ooh, fancy. Can I get a slice?
[Message 52] Jamie: Of course! Anytime. What about you, any accounting stories?
[Message 53] Alex: Other than Mark and his Excel adventures? Nothing too exciting, thankfully.
[Message 54] Jamie: Sometimes boring is good.
[Message 55] Alex: Absolutely. Keeps the stress levels down. Remember that audit last year?
[Message 56] Jamie: Don't remind me! Still having nightmares.
[Message 57] Alex: Tell me about it. We earned our salaries that month.
[Message 58] Jamie: We really did. Okay, new topic. Vacation plans?
[Message 59] Alex: Still dreaming of that trip to Italy.
[Message 60] Jamie: Ooh, Italy! Where do you want to go?
[Message 61] Alex: Florence, Rome, maybe a little time in Tuscany.
[Message 62] Jamie: Sounds amazing. I'm thinking of just staying put and doing some local fishing.
[Message 63] Alex: A relaxing staycation is good too!
[Message 64] Jamie: Exactly. Less hassle. More fish.
[Message 65] Alex: Fair enough! Did you see that article about the Austin bat colony?
[Message 66] Jamie: The Congress Avenue Bridge ones? Yeah, they're pretty cool.
[Message 67] Alex: I still need to go see them sometime.
[Message 68] Jamie: Definitely worth it! Especially at sunset.
[Message 69] Alex: Adding it to the Austin bucket list.
[Message 70] Jamie: Good idea! Okay, back to funny stories… I have another one about my cat.
[Message 71] Alex: Lay it on me! I love cat stories.
[Message 72] Jamie: So, Mittens decided to…

[Message 2] Jamie: ""Hey Alex! Yeah, definitely. Trying to avoid the rush on election day itself.""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Smart. Been reading about that new infrastructure bill. What are your thoughts?""
[Message 4] Jamie: ""Honestly, I'm still trying to wrap my head around all the details. Seems like a lot of it would benefit the real estate market though, with new construction and all.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""That's a good point. More infrastructure, more opportunities for development. Makes sense.""
[Message 6] Jamie: ""Exactly! Say, you catching any good fish lately?""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Haven't had much time, unfortunately. Work's been crazy. These sales targets are killing me!""
[Message 8] Jamie: ""I hear you. Closing deals can be stressful. Maybe a fishing trip is what you need to de-stress after the election!""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Haha, I wish. Back to the bill, though – I'm a bit worried about the potential tax implications.""
[Message 10] Jamie: ""Yeah, that's a valid concern. Nobody wants their taxes to go up. Have you seen any reliable analyses?""
[Message 11] Alex: ""A few, but they're all so partisan! Hard to know what's really going on.""
[Message 12] Jamie: ""Tell me about it. Everything's so polarized these days. Makes having a rational conversation difficult.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Absolutely. Anyway, I should get going. Gotta finalize this proposal. Big potential client.""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""Good luck! Hope you land it.""

[Message 16] Jamie: ""Showing a renovated Victorian downtown this weekend. Fingers crossed someone makes an offer!""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Victorian, huh? Those are beautiful. Hope it goes well!""
[Message 18] Jamie: ""Thanks! I'm also working on a deal to help a friend of a friend buy a place. Lots of paperwork involved as you can imagine.""

[Message 2] Ben: ""Totally, Alex! My grandma made the best potato salad. Pure comfort food.""
[Message 3] Chloe: ""Oh man, potato salad! My mom always added too much mustard. Still ate it though, haha.""
[Message 4] Daniel: ""Mustard potato salad? Sounds… adventurous, Chloe. My dad was the grill master, always burned the hotdogs.""
[Message 5] Emily: ""Burning hotdogs is a classic dad move, Daniel! My grandpa made the best s'mores, perfectly toasted marshmallow every time.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""S'mores! Okay, now I'm craving something sweet. Anyone looking at the dessert menu?""
[Message 7] Ben: ""Already on it, Alex. They have peach cobbler, which reminds me of picking peaches at my uncle's orchard as a kid.""
[Message 8] Chloe: ""Peach cobbler sounds divine. I used to help my aunt make it, but mostly just ate the peaches raw.""
[Message 9] Daniel: ""Raw peaches are the best! We had a peach tree in our backyard growing up. My siblings and I would fight over them.""
[Message 10] Emily: ""Wow, a peach tree in your backyard! That's like something out of a movie. We had a swing set. Many scraped knees were had.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Scraped knees! A rite of passage. What about playground equipment? Anyone remember those metal slides that would get scorching hot?""
[Message 12] Ben: ""Oh god, the metal slides! You'd practically get third-degree burns sliding down in shorts. Good times… mostly.""
[Message 13] Chloe: ""Those slides were brutal! I preferred the swings. I could swing for hours. It's probably why I still like amusement parks.""
[Message 14] Daniel: ""Swings are the best. Simple, but so much fun. I remember trying to swing so high I'd go over the top. Never succeeded, sadly.""
[Message 15] Emily: ""Haha, I tried that too, Daniel! Mostly just got dizzy. I was more into climbing trees. My mom hated it.""
[Message 16] Alex: ""Climbing trees! Definitely a risky move. Speaking of risky, anyone order yet? I'm starving.""
[Message 17] Ben: ""I put in an order for ribs and the pulled pork. Figured we could share.""
[Message 18] Chloe: ""Ribs and pulled pork? Yes, please! I'm in.""
[Message 19] Daniel: ""Sounds perfect, Ben. Thanks! I'll grab some sides.""
[Message 20] Emily: ""Awesome! I'm good with whatever sides you choose, Daniel.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Perfect! Ribs, pulled pork, and sides. This is going to be a feast. Anyone else remember building forts as kids?""
[Message 22] Ben: ""Forts! We used to build elaborate forts in the woods behind my house. Used blankets, branches, everything.""
[Message 23] Chloe: ""We built forts in our living room. Couches, blankets, pillows… total mess, but so cozy.""
[Message 24] Daniel: ""Living room forts are the best. Especially with snacks and a flashlight. We'd tell each other spooky stories.""
[Message 25] Emily: ""Spooky stories in the fort! Classic. We always fought over who got to hold the flashlight.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""Flashlight control is serious business! Anyone ever play flashlight tag?""
[Message 27] Ben: ""Flashlight tag! Oh man, that brings back memories. So much running around in the dark.""
[Message 28] Chloe: ""We played flashlight tag all the time! I was always the worst at hiding.""
[Message 29] Daniel: ""Flashlight tag was intense! I was surprisingly good at it, despite being clumsy otherwise.""
[Message 30] Emily: ""I was always too scared to play flashlight tag. Too much darkness! I preferred hide-and-seek in the daytime.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Hide-and-seek in the daytime is much less terrifying! Did anyone collect anything as a kid?""
[Message 32] Ben: ""I collected baseball cards. Still have a few, actually.""
[Message 33] Chloe: ""I collected seashells. I had a whole box full of them.""
[Message 34] Daniel: ""I collected rocks. My parents were not thrilled.""
[Message 35] Emily: ""Rocks! That's awesome, Daniel. I collected stamps. My grandma got me started.""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Stamps and rocks! Very cool. I collected stickers. Covered everything in them.""
[Message 37] Ben: ""Stickers are a classic. Did anyone have a sticker book?""
[Message 38] Chloe: ""Oh yeah, sticker books were the best! I even had scratch-and-sniff stickers.""
[Message 39] Daniel: ""Scratch-and-sniff stickers! Those were the height of sophistication. Grape was my favorite.""
[Message 40] Emily: ""Grape! Yes! Mine was bubblegum. Anyone remember Pogs?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Pogs! Holy cow, I forgot about Pogs. Remember the slammers?""
[Message 42] Ben: ""The slammers! Yeah, those were serious business. People got really competitive.""
[Message 43] Chloe: ""I never really got into Pogs. I was more of a Beanie Baby person.""
[Message 44] Daniel: ""Beanie Babies! My sister was obsessed. We had them all over the house.""
[Message 45] Emily: ""Everyone was obsessed with Beanie Babies! The ""rare"" ones were supposed to be worth a fortune.""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Haha, yeah, the ""rare"" Beanie Babies. Anyone ever try to sell theirs?""
[Message 47] Ben: ""Nope. Still have mine in a box somewhere. Sentimental value, I guess.""
[Message 48] Chloe: ""Same. Mine are probably buried in my attic.""
[Message 49] Daniel: ""Mine ended up at a garage sale. Probably went for like, 50 cents each.""
[Message 50] Emily: ""Ouch, Daniel! I think mine are still at my parents' house. I should probably rescue them.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Rescue the Beanie Babies! Mission accepted. Okay, back to the food - how long do you think it'll be?""
[Message 52] Ben: ""Probably another 10 minutes or so, I'd guess.""
[Message 53] Chloe: ""Perfect, more time for reminiscing! Did anyone ever have a pet rock?""
[Message 54] Daniel: ""A pet rock! I almost forgot about those. Peak 70s/80s.""
[Message 55] Emily: ""I wanted a pet rock so badly! My parents thought it was ridiculous.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""My parents thought it was ridiculous too, Emily! I still wanted one. Speaking of pets, anyone have a childhood pet they loved?""
[Message 57] Ben: ""I had a golden retriever named Buddy. He was the best dog ever.""
[Message 58] Chloe: ""I had a cat named Mittens. She was super fluffy and lazy.""
[Message 59] Daniel: ""I had a hamster named Mr. Nibbles. He mostly just ran on his wheel all night.""
[Message 60] Emily: ""Mr. Nibbles! I had a fish named Bubbles. Very original, I know.""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Bubbles! Perfect name for a fish. I had a turtle named Shelly. Very creative, I know.""
[Message 62] Ben: ""Shelly the turtle! Did you ever take Shelly for walks?""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""Taking a turtle for a walk sounds like a very slow adventure!""
[Message 64] Daniel: ""Imagine the paparazzi! ""Local turtle spotted on leisurely stroll!""""
[Message 65] Emily: ""Ha! My fish didn't get much paparazzi attention. Maybe if I'd taught him tricks...""
[Message 66] Alex: ""Turtle paparazzi! Now that's a headline. What about favorite childhood TV shows?""
[Message 67] Ben: ""The Simpsons. Still love it.""
[Message 68] Chloe: ""Saved by the Bell. Total 90s cheese.""
[Message 69] Daniel: ""Star Trek: The Next Generation. Still a huge Trekkie.""
[Message 70] Emily: ""Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. So wholesome.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Mr. Rogers is a legend. I was all about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.""
[Message 72] Ben: ""Cowabunga! Did you have the action figures?""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""I had a crush on Zack Morris. Don't judge me.""
[Message 74] Daniel: ""Picard was my role model. Still is, honestly.""
[Message 75] Emily: ""Mister Rogers just made me feel safe. Such a comforting show.""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Comforting is a great word for it. Anyone remember getting excited about the ice cream truck?""
[Message 77] Ben: ""The ice cream truck! Running after it with dollar bills... good times.""
[Message 78] Chloe: ""The ice cream truck jingle was the soundtrack of summer.""
[Message 79] Daniel: ""Bomb Pops were my go-to. Red, white, and blue deliciousness.""
[Message 80] Emily: ""I always got the strawberry shortcake bar. So good!""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Strawberry shortcake bar! Classic. I was all about the character popsicles, even if they looked nothing like the characters.""
[Message 82] Ben: ""Haha, those character popsicles were always a gamble.""
[Message 83] Chloe: ""So true! Sometimes they were just a melty mess.""
[Message 84] Daniel: ""A melty mess of sugar and disappointment.""
[Message 85] Emily: ""But even the melty messes were delicious!""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Exactly! Okay, I'm getting hungry again. I wonder where that food is.""
[Message 87] Ben: ""I'll check with the waiter.""
[Message 88] Chloe: ""Good idea, Ben! Thanks!""
[Message 89] Daniel: ""Appreciate it!""
[Message 90] Emily: ""Thanks, Ben!""
[Message 91] Alex: ""While we wait, anyone have a favorite childhood book?""
[Message 92] Ben: ""The Hobbit. Still reread it every few years.""
[Message 93] Chloe: ""Matilda by Roald Dahl. Loved her.""
[Message 94] Daniel: ""Dune. Started my lifelong love of sci-fi.""
[Message 95] Emily: ""Goodnight Moon. So simple and sweet.""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Goodnight Moon is a classic! I was obsessed with The Giving Tree.""
[Message 97] Ben: ""The Giving Tree is so sad though!""
[Message 98] Chloe: ""Yeah, it's a bit of a tearjerker.""
[Message 99] Daniel: ""Agreed. Bittersweet.""
[Message 100] Emily: ""My mom read Goodnight Moon to me every night.""
[Message 101] Alex: ""That's so sweet, Emily! Anyone have a favorite board game from childhood?""
[Message 102] Ben: ""Monopoly. Always ended in arguments.""
[Message 103] Chloe: ""Clue. I loved solving mysteries.""
[Message 104] Daniel: ""Risk. I was a strategic mastermind (in my own mind).""
[Message 105] Emily: ""Candy Land. Simple, but fun.""
[Message 106] Alex: ""Candy Land is a classic! I was all about Life. Wanted to see where I ended up.""
[Message 107] Ben: ""Life was fun! Did anyone actually follow the instructions or just make up their own rules?""
[Message 108] Chloe: ""We definitely made up our own rules in Clue. Much more dramatic.""
[Message 109] Daniel: ""Risk always devolved into alliances and betrayals. Just like real life!""
[Message 110] Emily: ""Candy Land was pretty straightforward. Not much room for improvisation.""
[Message 111] Alex: ""Sounds like Risk was intense, Daniel! Anyone else remember playing MASH?""
[Message 112] Ben: ""MASH! Oh man, predicting your future with that game.""
[Message 113] Chloe: ""MASH was the best! Always hoping for a mansion and a rockstar husband.""
[Message 114] Daniel: ""I always ended up living in a shack and marrying my least favorite person.""
[Message 115] Emily: ""I don't think I ever played MASH. Was it a regional thing?""
[Message 116] Alex: ""Maybe, Emily! It was huge where I grew up. Anyone else remember cootie catchers?""
[Message 117] Ben: ""Cootie catchers! Origami fortune tellers. Loved those.""
[Message 118] Chloe: ""Yes! We made them all the time in elementary school.""
[Message 119] Daniel: ""Always gave the silliest fortunes.""
[Message 120] Emily: ""I remember those! We called them fortune tellers, not cootie catchers.""
[Message 121] Alex: ""Fortune tellers! That's what we called them too. Wait, Ben's back. What's the word on the food?""
[Message 122] Ben: ""It's coming right up! They said just a few more minutes.""
[Message 123] Chloe: ""Great! Thanks, Ben!""
[Message 124] Daniel: ""Awesome, I'm starving.""
[Message 125] Emily: ""Yay! I can't wait.""
[Message 126] Alex: ""Perfect! Okay, last childhood memory question - favorite school subject?""
[Message 127] Ben: ""History. Loved learning about the past.""
[Message 128] Chloe: ""Art. I could draw all day.""
[Message 129] Daniel: ""Science. I'm a nerd at heart.""
[Message 130] Emily: ""Reading. Always loved a good story.""
[Message 131] Alex: ""Reading is fantastic! I loved writing. Making up my own stories.""
[Message 132] Ben: ""Writing is a great skill to have.""
[Message 133] Chloe: ""Definitely! Expressing yourself creatively is important.""
[Message 134] Daniel: ""I admire people who can write well. It's a powerful tool.""
[Message 135] Emily: ""So true. I wish I was a better writer.""
[Message 136] Alex: ""Practice makes perfect, Emily! And look, the food is here!""
[Message 137] Ben: ""Finally! Let's dig in.""
[Message 138] Chloe: ""This looks amazing!""
[Message 139] Daniel: ""Woohoo! Time to feast.""
[Message 140] Emily: ""Everything smells delicious!""
[Message 141] Alex: ""Okay, everyone, grab a plate! This pulled pork looks incredible.""
[Message 142] Ben: ""I'm going for the ribs first. They look perfectly cooked.""
[Message 143] Chloe: ""I'm loading up on sides. That coleslaw looks amazing.""
[Message 144] Daniel: ""Mac and cheese for me! Can't go wrong with mac and cheese.""
[Message 145] Emily: ""I'm trying a little bit of everything! So excited.""
[Message 146] Alex: ""This is so good! Best BBQ I've had in a while.""
[Message 147] Ben: ""Agreed! They really know what they're doing here.""
[Message 148] Chloe: ""Absolutely delicious! So glad we came here.""
[Message 149] Daniel: ""Definitely worth the wait. This is fantastic.""
[Message 150] Emily: ""Everything is cooked to perfection! What a great meal.""
[Message 151] Alex: ""So, anyone else still thinking about those character popsicles?""
[Message 152] Ben: ""Haha, always!""
[Message 153] Chloe: ""Maybe we should see if they have any on the dessert menu!""
[Message 154] Daniel: ""That would be amazing.""
[Message 155] Emily: ""I'm in! For nostalgia's sake.""
[Message 156] Alex: ""I'll ask the waiter! Worth a shot. Anyone need more BBQ sauce?""
[Message 157] Ben: ""I'm good, thanks!""
[Message 158] Chloe: ""I'm all set!""
[Message 159] Daniel: ""I'm good too!""
[Message 160] Emily: ""Thanks, but I'm okay!""
[Message 161] Alex: ""Alright! This has been such a fun night. Great food and great company.""
[Message 162] Ben: ""Agreed! We should do this again soon.""
[Message 163] Chloe: ""Definitely! Let's plan something.""
[Message 164] Daniel: ""I'm in! It's been too long.""
[Message 165] Emily: ""I'd love that! This was so much fun.""
[Message 166] Alex: ""Perfect! We'll figure something out. In the meantime, enjoy the rest of your BBQ!""
[Message 167] Ben: ""Will do! Thanks again for organizing this, Alex.""

347,"[Message 1] CHLOE: OMG, did you guys hear about what happened at the Community Center?
[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, it's all over the news. Crazy.
[Message 3] MAYA: Two people dead... it's so awful. Who were they?
[Message 4] NOAH: I heard it was Sarah and Ashley.
[Message 5] CHLOE: Sarah and Ashley?! No way! I just saw Sarah yesterday.
[Message 6] LIAM: I know, right? Ashley was always so optimistic. This is messed up.
[Message 7] MAYA: What happened exactly? All I know is ""double homicide.""
[Message 8] NOAH: Stabbing, apparently. Dawn at the Community Center.
[Message 9] CHLOE: Stabbing? That's brutal.
[Message 10] LIAM: Anyone know anything more?
[Message 11] MAYA: The news said the police are investigating.
[Message 12] NOAH: Obviously.
[Message 13] CHLOE: I can't believe it. Sarah was always so creative.
[Message 14] LIAM: Yeah, and Ashley, always trying to cheer everyone up.
[Message 15] MAYA: I used to take that pottery class with Sarah. She was really good.
[Message 16] NOAH: Did either of you know them well?
[Message 17] CHLOE: Just casually. We'd chat sometimes at the Center.
[Message 18] LIAM: Same. I helped Ashley with her computer once.
[Message 19] MAYA: I wonder who would do something like this?
[Message 20] NOAH: No idea. Someone messed up, big time. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 21] CHLOE: Seriously. Hope they catch them soon.
[Message 22] LIAM: Me too. This whole thing is giving me the creeps.
[Message 23] MAYA: Speaking of creeps, did you guys see that new horror movie trailer?
[Message 24] NOAH: Not yet. Is it any good?
[Message 25] CHLOE: Looks terrifying!
[Message 26] LIAM: I'm not a big horror fan, to be honest.
[Message 27] MAYA: Suit yourself. More popcorn for me then!
[Message 28] NOAH: I might check it out. Gotta distract myself from all this...
[Message 29] CHLOE: Exactly.
[Message 30] LIAM: So, anyone doing anything fun this weekend?
[Message 31] MAYA: Thinking about going hiking.
[Message 32] NOAH: I might just chill at home and play video games.
[Message 33] CHLOE: Same. Need a mental health day.
[Message 34] LIAM: Understandable.
[Message 35] MAYA: This whole thing is just so sad.
[Message 36] NOAH: It is. Makes you think.
[Message 37] CHLOE: Definitely.
[Message 38] LIAM: Anyway, I gotta get back to work. Talk to you guys later.
[Message 39] MAYA: Later!
[Message 40] NOAH: Bye.
[Message 41] CHLOE: See ya.
[Message 42] AVA: Hey guys, have you heard anything new about the Community Center thing?
[Message 43] CHLOE: Hey Ava. Just the same old stuff on the news.
[Message 44] LIAM: Nothing concrete, just speculation.
[Message 45] MAYA: Why? You know something?
[Message 46] AVA: I heard the police were questioning Kai.
[Message 47] NOAH: Kai? Really?
[Message 48] CHLOE: Kai? I thought he was just trying to get famous.
[Message 49] LIAM: Yeah, what's he got to do with it?
[Message 50] MAYA: Maybe he knew something?
[Message 51] AVA: I don't know. That's just what I heard from a friend who works at the police station.
[Message 52] NOAH: Huh. Interesting.
[Message 53] CHLOE: Kai's always been a bit…intense.
[Message 54] LIAM: Intense is one word for it.
[Message 55] MAYA: What do you mean?
[Message 56] CHLOE: He was always talking about wanting to make a name for himself.
[Message 57] LIAM: Yeah, he's got a real… ambition.
[Message 58] MAYA: Still, that doesn't make him a murderer.
[Message 59] NOAH: True. But it's worth looking into.
[Message 60] AVA: I agree.
[Message 61] CHLOE: Anyone know where Kai was that night?
[Message 62] LIAM: No idea.
[Message 63] MAYA: I saw him buying Stabbing with a knife at the store couple days ago.
[Message 64] NOAH: Well that sound suspicious.
[Message 65] AVA: I need to know that for sure.
[Message 66] CHLOE: Yeah? You got a crush on him.
[Message 67] LIAM: I need to know what the police knew about this.
[Message 68] MAYA: Sure. We all do.
[Message 69] NOAH: Okay.
[Message 70] AVA: Yeah, I need to know he is not going to go jail.
[Message 71] CHLOE: Why would he?
[Message 72] LIAM: It's not like they are boyfriend and girlfriend, right?
[Message 73] MAYA: Of course! We are talking about murder.
[Message 74] NOAH: I feel like maybe there are not enough evidences.
[Message 75] AVA: Maybe, but maybe there are.
[Message 76] CHLOE: I have some work to do.
[Message 77] LIAM: See ya guys.
[Message 78] MAYA: Bye.
[Message 79] NOAH: Bye Ava.
[Message 80] AVA: Bye Noah.
[Message 81] KAI: Hey Ava, you won't believe what's happening.
[Message 82] AVA: What's up, Kai?
[Message 83] KAI: The cops are all over me about the Community Center.
[Message 84] AVA: What?! Why?
[Message 85] KAI: Something about being a ""person of interest."" It's ridiculous!
[Message 86] AVA: Did you... were you even there that night?
[Message 87] KAI: No! I was at home, working on my videos. I swear!
[Message 88] AVA: Do you have any proof? Anyone who can vouch for you?
[Message 89] KAI: Ugh, no. I was alone. That's the problem.
[Message 90] AVA: Okay, okay, don't panic. Maybe we can figure something out.
[Message 91] KAI: What? What can we do?
[Message 92] AVA: I'll talk to my friend at the police station, see what they have on you.
[Message 93] KAI: Really? You'd do that for me?
[Message 94] AVA: Of course. But Kai, be honest with me. Did you see anything? Anything at all?
[Message 95] KAI: No! I swear, Ava. I wouldn't hurt anyone. Especially not Ashley.
[Message 96] AVA: What about Sarah? Did you know her?
[Message 97] KAI: I knew of her. From the Center. But that's it. Look, this is messing with my head. I need to focus on my career.
[Message 98] AVA: I understand. Just… try to stay calm. I'll call you later.
[Message 99] KAI: Thanks, Ava. You're the best.
[Message 100] AVA: Don't mention it.
[Message 101] NOAH: Ava, you there?
[Message 102] AVA: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 103] NOAH: So, Kai... you seem pretty concerned about him.
[Message 104] AVA: He's a friend, Noah. Of course I'm concerned.
[Message 105] NOAH: Right. Just... be careful. He's got a motive, you know? Revenge for a past wrong.
[Message 106] AVA: What are you talking about?
[Message 107] NOAH: I heard he and Ashley had a falling out a while back. Something about a project they were working on together.
[Message 108] AVA: I don't know anything about that.
[Message 109] NOAH: Just saying. Don't let your… feelings cloud your judgment.
[Message 110] AVA: My feelings? What feelings?
[Message 111] NOAH: Never mind. Just... watch your back.
[Message 112] AVA: I always do.
[Message 113] NOAH: Good.
[Message 114] KAI: Ava, I have to tell you something.
[Message 115] AVA: What is it, Kai? You're scaring me.
[Message 116] KAI: Remember how I said I was home all night?
[Message 117] AVA: Yes…?
[Message 118] KAI: I... I wasn't completely honest.
[Message 119] AVA: Where were you, Kai?
[Message 120] KAI: I went for a walk. I couldn't sleep.
[Message 121] AVA: And? Did you go anywhere near the Community Center?
[Message 122] KAI: ...I walked past it. But I didn't go inside. I swear!
[Message 123] AVA: Kai, you need to tell the police this.
[Message 124] KAI: No! They'll think I did it! I just... I just wanted to clear my head.
[Message 125] AVA: But if you're innocent, it'll help your case.
[Message 126] KAI: I don't know...
[Message 127] AVA: Kai, I'm trying to help you. But you need to be honest with me.
[Message 128] KAI: Okay, okay. I'll think about it.
[Message 129] AVA: Please do.
[Message 130] KAI: Thanks, Ava. You're a true friend.
[Message 131] AVA: Just be careful, okay? And tell me everything.
[Message 132] KAI: I will.
[Message 133] CHLOE: Hey Ava, any updates on Kai?
[Message 134] AVA: Nothing much, Chloe. He's still stressed.
[Message 135] CHLOE: He should be. You know, Ashley firing him from that project probably provoked him, right?
[Message 136] AVA: I don't know the details.
[Message 137] CHLOE: Well, that's what I heard. Anyway, gotta go. Good luck with everything.
[Message 138] AVA: Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 139] LIAM: Ava, you still talking to Kai?
[Message 140] AVA: Yeah, a little.
[Message 141] LIAM: Be careful, okay? Something about him doesn't sit right with me.
[Message 142] AVA: I will be. Thanks, Liam.
[Message 143] MAYA: Ava, you okay? You seem distracted.
[Message 144] AVA: I'm fine, Maya. Just tired.

[Message 1] Liam: Hey guys, heard about what happened at Town Hall? Crazy.
[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, insane! Two people dead. Who even does that?
[Message 3] Noah: Town Hall? What happened? I was at the gym all morning.
[Message 4] Chloe: Noah, seriously? It's all over the news. Two people were murdered.
[Message 5] Ethan: Awful. Anyone know the details?
[Message 6] Liam: Apparently, stabbed. Real messy.
[Message 7] Maya: Poor souls. Wonder what the motive was.
[Message 8] Noah: Stabbing? Jesus. That's brutal. Hope they catch the guy. Or guys.
[Message 9] Chloe: Yeah, me too. This city is getting scary.
[Message 10] Ethan: Agreed. So, gym, Noah? What time were you there?
[Message 11] Noah: Like, 9 to 12. Why?
[Message 12] Ethan: Just curious.
[Message 13] Liam: Ethan, don't start. People are dead, man.
[Message 14] Ethan: I'm not starting anything. Just making conversation.
[Message 15] Maya: Anyway, anyone know who the victims were?
[Message 16] Chloe: I heard one was Sarah, the journalist. The other was, I think, Alex, worked in social work.
[Message 17] Noah: Sarah? Wow. She was always nice to me.
[Message 18] Ethan: Alex? Never heard of them.
[Message 19] Liam: Yeah, Sarah. Always saw her around. Terrible.
[Message 20] Maya: Alex was a good person, helped a lot of people. This is so unfair.
[Message 21] Chloe: Agreed. Makes you think.
[Message 22] Noah: Think about what?
[Message 23] Chloe: Just... life. How fragile it is.
[Message 24] Ethan: Deep thoughts, Chloe.
[Message 25] Liam: Okay, let's not get too philosophical.
[Message 26] Maya: I'm still trying to process this. Two innocent lives gone.
[Message 27] Noah: Did they say how it happened? Like, were they robbed?
[Message 28] Chloe: News said stabbing with an ice pick. Apparently, there was an ice pick found at a store bought yesterday, the store clerk saw someone buy it but couldn't remember them. 
[Message 29] Ethan: Ice pick? That's... specific.
[Message 30] Liam: Yeah, sounds like someone really meant to do it.
[Message 31] Maya: Seriously. Premeditated.
[Message 32] Noah: Premeditated? You think so? Maybe it was just a random act of violence.
[Message 33] Chloe: I doubt it. Ice pick?
[Message 34] Ethan: Maybe someone had a weird hobby.
[Message 35] Liam: Ethan, you're being insensitive.
[Message 36] Ethan: I'm just saying, don't jump to conclusions.
[Message 37] Maya: I agree with Liam. It's too specific.
[Message 38] Noah: Okay, okay. Just playing devil's advocate.
[Message 39] Chloe: Right.
[Message 40] Ethan: Anyone up for pizza tonight? Distract ourselves?
[Message 41] Liam: Seriously, Ethan? Now?
[Message 42] Ethan: What? I'm hungry.
[Message 43] Maya: Maybe later, Ethan. Let's just... reflect.
[Message 44] Noah: Yeah, give it a rest, man.
[Message 45] Chloe: I'm with Maya. Not in the mood.
[Message 46] Ethan: Fine, fine. Party poopers.
[Message 47] Liam: Whatever.
[Message 48] Maya: I need to go. Talk later.
[Message 49] Noah: Me too. See ya.
[Message 50] Chloe: Bye.
[Message 51] Ethan: Later.
[Message 52] Liam: I heard someone saw you near Town Hall, Noah. What were you doing there?
[Message 53] Noah: What? That's a lie. I was at the gym, I told you. Someone must have mistaken me for someone else.
[Message 54] Liam: Just asking.
[Message 55] Noah: Well, don't. It's not funny.
[Message 56] Liam: I'm not trying to be funny.
[Message 57] Noah: Then what are you trying to do? Accuse me of something?
[Message 58] Liam: Calm down, man.
[Message 59] Noah: I am calm. You're the one making accusations.
[Message 60] Liam: Forget it.
[Message 61] Noah: Good.
[Message 62] Chloe: I saw Ethan arguing with Sarah last week. Anyone know why?
[Message 63] Maya: I thought they didn't know each other?
[Message 64] Chloe: I'm sure it was them, arguing near the coffee shop.
[Message 65] Ethan: That wasn't me, I swear. I haven't spoken to Sarah in months. Must have been someone else.
[Message 66] Liam: You sure about that, Ethan?
[Message 67] Ethan: Positive. I was out of town last week anyway.
[Message 68] Maya: Out of town? Where?
[Message 69] Ethan: Visiting my aunt in Orlando.
[Message 70] Chloe: Weird.
[Message 71] Liam: So you say.
[Message 72] Ethan: Why would I lie?
[Message 73] Maya: I don't know, Ethan. Why would you?
[Message 74] Ethan: Look, I didn't do anything.
[Message 75] Liam: No one said you did.
[Message 76] Ethan: Well, it feels like you're implying it.
[Message 77] Maya: We're just trying to figure things out.
[Message 78] Chloe: It does seem weird that Sarah was murdered and you were arguing with someone, who Chloe thinks was her, last week.
[Message 79] Ethan: Okay, I'm done with this conversation. I have to go.
[Message 80] Liam: Running away?
[Message 81] Ethan: No, I have things to do. Leave me alone.
[Message 82] Maya: Fine.
[Message 83] Chloe: Bye.
[Message 84] Liam: Later.
[Message 85] Noah: Hey Maya, you okay? You seemed really upset earlier.
[Message 86] Maya: Yeah, it's just... Alex was a really good friend.
[Message 87] Noah: I'm sorry to hear that. It must be tough.
[Message 88] Maya: It is. I just keep thinking about what could have been.
[Message 89] Noah: Yeah, I get it.
[Message 90] Maya: Thanks, Noah. I appreciate it.
[Message 91] Noah: Anytime.
[Message 92] Chloe: Does anyone think that the fact Alex was a social worker has anything to do with this?
[Message 93] Liam: What do you mean?
[Message 94] Chloe: Well, maybe they pissed off the wrong person. You know, in their work.
[Message 95] Liam: That's a possibility.
[Message 96] Maya: Don't know how to tell this.. Alex was trans.
[Message 97] Noah: Could be a hate crime.
[Message 98] Chloe: True. That's awful.
[Message 99] Liam: Yeah, that's messed up.
[Message 100] Ethan: Could be anything, really.
[Message 101] Maya: I just hope they find who did this.
[Message 102] Noah: Me too. They deserve to pay.
[Message 103] Chloe: Big time. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 104] Liam: Agreed.
[Message 105] Ethan: Justice will be served.
[Message 106] Maya: I need to go. This is too much.
[Message 107] Noah: Alright, take care.
[Message 108] Chloe: See ya.
[Message 109] Liam: Later.
[Message 110] Ethan: Bye.
[Message 111] Noah: So, Chloe, you really think Ethan was arguing with Sarah?
[Message 112] Chloe: I'm pretty sure.
[Message 113] Noah: He denied it pretty vehemently.
[Message 114] Chloe: Yeah, well, he would, wouldn't he?
[Message 115] Noah: True. Still, seems far-fetched.
[Message 116] Chloe: I don't know, Noah. Something's off about him.
[Message 117] Noah: Maybe.
[Message 118] Liam: I've been thinking about what happened. Something doesn't add up.
[Message 119] Chloe: What do you mean?
[Message 120] Liam: I don't know exactly. Just a feeling.
[Message 121] Chloe: Tell me more.
[Message 122] Liam: It's just... the way everyone is acting. It feels forced.
[Message 123] Chloe: Forced how?
[Message 124] Liam: Like everyone is trying too hard to seem normal.
[Message 125] Chloe: Maybe they're just shocked.
[Message 126] Liam: Maybe. Or maybe they're hiding something.
[Message 127] Chloe: Who do you think is hiding something?
[Message 128] Liam: I don't know yet. I just have a feeling.
[Message 129] Chloe: This is getting intense.
[Message 130] Liam: It is what it is.
[Message 131] Chloe: True.
[Message 132] Noah: Hey Chloe, you still online?
[Message 133] Chloe: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 134] Noah: Just wanted to ask you something. Privately.
[Message 135] Chloe: Okay...
[Message 136] Ethan: Has anyone heard any updates on the case?
[Message 137] Liam: Not that I know of.
[Message 138] Ethan: Just curious.
[Message 139] Liam: Why?
[Message 140] Ethan: No reason. Just wondering if they caught the guy yet.
[Message 141] Liam: Doubt it's that easy.
[Message 142] Ethan: Guess not.
[Message 143] Liam: How was Orlando?
[Message 144] Ethan: Fine. Hot.
[Message 145] Liam: See any mice?
[Message 146] Ethan: What?
[Message 147] Liam: Nevermind.
[Message 148] Ethan: Weird.
[Message 149] Chloe: I heard that Sarah may have gotten into an argument with someone at Town Hall the day before she was killed. It’s being said that Sarah intended to write something about a member that night.
[Message 150] Liam: Someone from Town Hall? Interesting.
[Message 151] Ethan: That's probably nothing.
[Message 152] Liam: Maybe. Maybe not.
[Message 153] Ethan: You guys are really grasping at straws.
[Message 154] Chloe: Maybe. But something feels off.
[Message 155] Liam: Agreed.
[Message 156] Noah: Hey guys, sorry I disappeared. Had to take a call.
[Message 157] Ethan: No worries.
[Message 158] Liam: So, Noah, what did you and Chloe talk about privately?
[Message 159] Noah: Just girl stuff. Nothing you need to worry about.
[Message 160] Liam: Right.
[Message 161] Ethan: Yeah, right.
[Message 162] Noah: Seriously, it's nothing.
[Message 163] Chloe: It's true. Nothing to see here.
[Message 164] Liam: Okay, whatever you say.
[Message 165] Ethan: Still think I was arguing with Sarah?
[Message 166] Chloe: It's possible.
[Message 167] Ethan: Well, you're wrong.
[Message 168] Chloe: Okay.
[Message 169] Liam: Did anyone know that Alex was working on a big story about corruption in the city government?
[Message 170] Maya: No way! Really?
[Message 171] Chloe: That's intense.
[Message 172] Ethan: See, it was probably just some random thing.
[Message 173] Liam: Maybe. Or maybe someone didn't want that story to come out.
[Message 174] Chloe: That's a good point.
[Message 175] Noah: It's possible.
[Message 176] Ethan: You guys are really reaching now.
[Message 177] Liam: Maybe we are. Or maybe we're on to something.
[Message 178] Chloe: It’s said that the crime occurred at late morning, Noah, didn't you say you were at the gym from 9 to 12? That gives you a good time slot.
[Message 179] Noah: I did go to the gym, yeah, but I didn't kill anyone.
[Message 180] Maya: I don't know, he always hated Alex.
[Message 181] Ethan: I agree, you were talking about hurting her right before you went over there.
[Message 182] Liam: So what you guys saying? Noah's our guy?
[Message 183] Ethan: It definitely adds up.
[Message 184] Noah: Fine, I'm done with this conversation. I have to go.
[Message 185] Chloe: He went from 9 am to 11:30 am, there was an intervening cause when he failed to call 911 after seeing Alex.
[Message 186] Liam: Seems that this is where it all started!
[Message 187] Chloe: It's clear that it was no failure, it was intent.
[Message 188] Ethan: His state of mind made him know he wanted to murder.
[Message 189] Liam: It's the actus reus and mens rea together!
[Message 190] Chloe: This all makes sense..
[Message 191] Ethan: He should get death penalty.
[Message 192] Liam: I agree, his shouts probably provoked them.
[Message 193] Chloe: He should be punished.
[Message 194] Liam: It seems that Noah's crime was probably just some random thing.
[Message 195] Ethan: I agree.",1,

[Message 4] Kai: Me too! It's so close to my place. Who was it?
[Message 5] Jordan: They said her name was Sarah.
[Message 6] Alex: Sarah? I don't think I knew her.
[Message 7] Blake: Heard it was messy. Wonder what happened.
[Message 8] Kai: They're not saying much. Just that it's a murder investigation.

[Message 10] Alex: Speaking of Charlotte PD, did you guys see that new Tesla they got?
[Message 11] Blake: I'm so shook. This is insane.
[Message 12] Kai: Blake, you okay? You seem more affected than usual.
[Message 13] Blake: Just... it's unsettling, you know? Knowing something like that happened so close.
[Message 14] Jordan: True. Crime is getting out of hand.
[Message 15] Alex: Agreed. Hey, anyone up for a movie tonight? Distract ourselves?
[Message 16] Kai: I'm in! What movie?
[Message 17] Jordan: I could use a distraction. Count me in too.

[Message 21] Alex: We'll save you some popcorn.
[Message 22] Blake: Thanks. I appreciate it.
[Message 23] Kai: Anyway, back to the murder... I wonder if they have any suspects.
[Message 24] Jordan: Probably. Someone saw something, I bet.
[Message 25] Alex: Hopefully, they catch whoever did it.
[Message 26] Blake: Yeah. Hope they pay.
[Message 27] Kai: That's intense, Blake.
[Message 28] Blake: Sorry, just... it's scary.
[Message 29] Jordan: It is. So, movie at Alex's place?
[Message 30] Alex: Yep! 8 pm. Pizza too.
[Message 31] Kai: Perfect! See you guys then.
[Message 32] Jordan: Later!
[Message 33] Blake: ...
[Message 34] Kai: Blake, everything okay? You're being weirdly quiet.
[Message 35] Blake: Just thinking.
[Message 36] Kai: About...?
[Message 37] Blake: About how messed up people can be.
[Message 38] Jordan: Preach.
[Message 39] Alex: Seriously. There's too much garbage out there.
[Message 40] Blake: Did anyone know Sarah?
[Message 41] Kai: Not really. I saw her around, but never spoke to her.
[Message 42] Jordan: Same.
[Message 43] Alex: I think I sold her a coffee once. That's it.
[Message 44] Blake: Huh.
[Message 45] Kai: Why do you ask, Blake?
[Message 46] Blake: No reason. Just curious.
[Message 47] Jordan: You seem really invested in this, Blake.
[Message 48] Blake: I'm not. Just... disturbed.
[Message 49] Alex: We all are.
[Message 50] Kai: So, movie still on?
[Message 51] Jordan: Yep!
[Message 52] Alex: Absolutely! I'm making garlic bread.
[Message 53] Blake: I'll pass.
[Message 54] Kai: Okay. Get some rest.
[Message 55] Jordan: Yeah, take care.
[Message 56] Alex: Feel better!
[Message 57] Blake: ...
[Message 58] Kai: This is so creepy. I just saw a news van pull up across the street.
[Message 59] Jordan: Seriously?
[Message 60] Alex: Maybe they're investigating something else?
[Message 61] Kai: I don't know... it's parked right outside Blake's apartment.
[Message 62] Jordan: What?!
[Message 63] Alex: OMG.
[Message 64] Kai: Should we...?
[Message 65] Jordan: Call Blake?
[Message 66] Alex: Yeah.
[Message 67] Kai: I'm calling.
[Message 68] Jordan: Keep us updated.
[Message 69] Alex: My heart is racing.
[Message 70] Kai: No answer. I'm going over there.
[Message 71] Jordan: Be careful!
[Message 72] Alex: Seriously, Kai, be safe.
[Message 73] Kai: I will.
[Message 74] Jordan: What's going on?!
[Message 75] Alex: Anything?!
[Message 76] Kai: They're taking Blake away.
[Message 77] Jordan: What?! Arrested?
[Message 78] Alex: Yeah.
[Message 79] Jordan: For what?!
[Message 80] Kai: I don't know. They wouldn't tell me anything.
[Message 81] Alex: OMG. This is insane.
[Message 82] Jordan: I can't believe it.
[Message 83] Kai: I know, right?
[Message 84] Alex: Maybe it's a mistake?
[Message 85] Jordan: Let's hope so.
[Message 86] Kai: I'm so confused.
[Message 87] Alex: Me too.
[Message 88] Jordan: I never would have suspected Blake.
[Message 89] Kai: Me neither.
[Message 90] Alex: This whole situation is messed up. I saw blake buying Using a garrote at the store, but I thought it was for fun.
[Message 91] Jordan: Yeah.
[Message 92] Kai: I have to go. I'm still shaken up.
[Message 93] Jordan: Okay.
[Message 94] Alex: Me too. Talk later?
[Message 95] Jordan: Yeah.
[Message 96] Alex: Later.
[Message 97] Jordan: This is crazy...
[Message 98] Jordan: (Later that night) Alex, you up?
[Message 99] Alex: Yeah, couldn't sleep.
[Message 100] Jordan: Me neither. What do you think happened?
[Message 101] Alex: I don't know. Maybe Blake knew Sarah somehow? Or maybe Sarah knew about the cult-related ritualistic killing?
[Message 102] Jordan: Cult? I didn't hear anything about a cult.
[Message 103] Alex: Yeah, that's what I overheard someone saying. I don't know if it's true though.
[Message 104] Jordan: Wow. This keeps getting weirder.
[Message 105] Alex: Tell me about it. I saw him leave the building at Late Afternoon.
[Message 106] Jordan: Do you think Blake did it?
[Message 107] Alex: I don't want to believe it.
[Message 108] Jordan: Me neither. But...
[Message 109] Alex: But what?
[Message 110] Jordan: But Blake was acting strange earlier. And that news van...
[Message 111] Alex: True.
[Message 112] Jordan: Maybe Blake intended for this to happen?
[Message 113] Alex: Maybe. I don't know what to think.
[Message 114] Jordan: I'm going to try and get some sleep.
[Message 115] Alex: Okay. Me too.
[Message 116] Jordan: Night.
[Message 117] Alex: Night.
[Message 118] Jordan: Alex, one more thing.
[Message 119] Alex: Yeah?
[Message 120] Jordan: I saw you talking to Sarah a few weeks ago. What was that about?
[Message 121] Alex: What? No, you didn't. I only sold her a coffee once, remember?
[Message 122] Jordan: I'm pretty sure I saw you two arguing. It looked intense.
[Message 123] Alex: You're mistaken. I swear.
[Message 124] Jordan: I don't know, Alex.
[Message 125] Alex: Look, I'm tired. Can we talk about this later?
[Message 126] Jordan: Fine. But I'm watching you.
[Message 127] Alex: Whatever.
[Message 128] Jordan: Goodnight.
[Message 129] Alex: Goodnight.
[Message 130] Jordan: (Next day) Kai, you free to talk?
[Message 131] Kai: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 132] Jordan: I have some doubts about Alex.
[Message 133] Kai: About what?
[Message 134] Jordan: About Alex's story. I think Alex knew Sarah better than they're letting on.
[Message 135] Kai: Really? What makes you say that?
[Message 136] Jordan: I saw them arguing a few weeks ago. Alex said they only sold Sarah a coffee once.
[Message 137] Kai: Huh. That's weird.
[Message 138] Jordan: I know, right?
[Message 139] Kai: Maybe we should talk to Alex?
[Message 140] Jordan: I already tried. They shut me down.
[Message 141] Kai: Maybe Alex is protecting someone?
[Message 142] Jordan: Or maybe Alex had a motive we don't know about. Her shouting probably provoked him.
[Message 143] Kai: True... What if Alex was involved in the drug dealing somehow?
[Message 144] Jordan: It's a stretch, but who knows at this point?
[Message 145] Kai: I have to go. I'll call you later.
[Message 146] Jordan: Okay. Be careful.
[Message 147] Kai: Always.
[Message 148] Jordan: This is getting more and more complicated.
[Message 149] Jordan: They're going away for a long time for this
[Message 150] Jordan: I should have called 911 after the victim was hurt.
[Message 151] Blake: I knew Sarah.
[Message 152] Jordan: Blake? How are you texting?
[Message 153] Kai: Blake?!
[Message 154] Blake: She was going to tell everyone what I did. The voices told me to do it.
[Message 155] Jordan: What did you do, Blake? What are you talking about?
[Message 156] Blake: I took care of it. She can't tell anyone now.
[Message 157] Kai: Took care of what, Blake?!
[Message 158] Blake: The problem. Sarah was the problem.
[Message 159] Jordan: Oh my god, Blake, you didn't!
[Message 160] Kai: This is insane.
[Message 161] Blake: It had to be done.
[Message 162] Jordan: Oh, god.
[Message 163] Blake: I wasn't myself.
[Message 164] Jordan: Please tell me you're joking.

[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. Recognize anyone?
[Message 3] Liam: No, thank god. Just hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 4] Chloe: Heard it on the news. Brutal. Anyone know the victims?
[Message 5] Maya: I think I saw the Bartender, Daniel, around a few times. Seemed like an okay guy.
[Message 6] Liam: Daniel? Yeah, I think I served him once or twice.
[Message 7] Chloe: The manager was a woman right? What was her name?
[Message 8] Maya: Security Guard was Anna, I think. Always had that cynical look, poor thing.
[Message 9] Liam: Yeah, Anna. Sad.
[Message 10] Chloe: Anyway, I'm swamped. Catch you later.
[Message 11] Liam: Later.
[Message 12] Maya: Later Chloe.
[Message 13] Liam: Maya, you going to the memorial service?
[Message 14] Maya: Probably. Shows respect, right? You?
[Message 15] Liam: Yeah, thinking about it.
[Message 16] Maya: Good. It's today at 2 pm right?
[Message 17] Liam: I think so. Heard a rumor that the guy who was fired last week was seen leaving the gallery late morning.
[Message 18] Maya: Oh really? That's suspicious. What was his name?
[Message 19] Liam: Greg, I think.
[Message 20] Maya: Greg... I don't recognize the name.
[Message 21] Chloe: Did someone say Greg? What about him?
[Message 22] Liam: Just heard he might be a suspect.
[Message 23] Chloe: Well, hopefully they find out what happened. It’s terrible for Anna.
[Message 24] Maya: Agreed.
[Message 25] Liam: So, service at 2? I can give you a ride.
[Message 26] Maya: Sure, sounds good. I’ll see you there.
[Message 27] Liam: Perfect.
[Message 28] Chloe: Need to get back to work. Talk later.
[Message 29] Liam: Later.
[Message 30] Maya: Bye.
[Message 31] Liam: This whole thing is just messed up.
[Message 32] Maya: Tell me about it. What did you hear about Anna?
[Message 33] Liam: Just that she was always on edge. Apparently, Greg was obsessed with her.
[Message 34] Maya: Wow, really? That changes things.
[Message 35] Liam: Yeah, seems like a solid motive. He intended to do something stupid, probably.
[Message 36] Maya: Hope they catch him fast.
[Message 37] Liam: Me too. Hey, you see that new exhibit downtown?
[Message 38] Maya: No, what’s it like?
[Message 39] Liam: Really cool, modern stuff. You should check it out sometime.
[Message 40] Maya: I might, thanks for the tip.
[Message 41] Liam: No problem.
[Message 42] Chloe: Anyone know what time the gallery opened that morning?
[Message 43] Liam: Not sure, Chloe. Probably around 9 or 10?
[Message 44] Maya: Maybe earlier for staff?
[Message 45] Chloe: True. Just curious.
[Message 46] Liam: So, you thinking of going to the service too, Chloe?
[Message 47] Chloe: Maybe. Depends on work.
[Message 48] Maya: Understandable.
[Message 49] Liam: Alright, gotta run. See you at 2, Maya.
[Message 50] Maya: See ya.
[Message 51] Chloe: Later.
[Message 52] Maya: Later.
[Message 53] Maya: (Later that evening) Hey Liam, something's bugging me.
[Message 54] Liam: What's up?
[Message 55] Maya: Chloe seemed really interested in the gallery's opening time.
[Message 56] Liam: Yeah, I noticed that too. Weird, right?
[Message 57] Maya: I don't know... just a feeling.
[Message 58] Liam: Maybe she knew Daniel or Anna?
[Message 59] Maya: Maybe. Or maybe she knows something we don't.
[Message 60] Liam: You think she was there?
[Message 61] Maya: I don’t know! But she was buying Pushing from a height at the store yesterday.
[Message 62] Liam: Pushing from a height? What does that mean?
[Message 63] Maya: Never mind. Wrong Pushing from a height. Just a figure of speech.
[Message 64] Liam: Okay... You going to the police with this?
[Message 65] Maya: Not yet. Just wanted to see what you thought.
[Message 66] Liam: Good call. Let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 67] Maya: Agreed.
[Message 68] Chloe: What are you two up to?
[Message 69] Liam: Just talking about the service.
[Message 70] Chloe: Oh. Anything interesting?
[Message 71] Maya: Not really.
[Message 72] Chloe: Okay. Just checking in.
[Message 73] Liam: Everything alright, Chloe?
[Message 74] Chloe: Yeah, fine. Why?
[Message 75] Liam: Just seemed a little…intense.
[Message 76] Chloe: I'm fine. Leave it alone, Liam.
[Message 77] Maya: Alright, alright. Everyone calm down.
[Message 78] Liam: Sorry, Chloe. Just concerned.
[Message 79] Chloe: Whatever.
[Message 80] Maya: Maybe we should all just get some sleep.
[Message 81] Liam: Good idea. Night.
[Message 82] Maya: Night.
[Message 83] Chloe: Night.
[Message 84] Liam: (The next day) Maya, you free for coffee?
[Message 85] Maya: Yeah, sure. When?
[Message 86] Liam: How about in an hour? Same place?
[Message 87] Maya: Sounds good. See you then.
[Message 88] Liam: Perfect.
[Message 89] Chloe: Coffee? Fun!
[Message 90] Liam: Just catching up with Maya.
[Message 91] Chloe: Oh. Okay.
[Message 92] Maya: See you in an hour, Liam.
[Message 93] Liam: Yep.
[Message 94] Chloe: Have fun.
[Message 95] Maya: (After coffee) Liam, I’m seriously worried about Chloe.
[Message 96] Liam: Me too. She's acting really strange.
[Message 97] Maya: I'm going to look into it more.
[Message 98] Liam: Be careful, Maya.
[Message 99] Maya: I will.
[Message 100] Liam: Let me know if you find anything.
[Message 101] Maya: Definitely.
[Message 102] Chloe: What are you two planning?
[Message 103] Maya: Just talking about work.
[Message 104] Chloe: Right.
[Message 105] Liam: Yeah, nothing to worry about, Chloe.
[Message 106] Chloe: I hope not.
[Message 107] Maya: Chloe, why were you asking about the gallery's opening time?
[Message 108] Chloe: I told you, just curious.
[Message 109] Maya: Curious enough to ask repeatedly?
[Message 110] Chloe: Look, it's none of your business, okay?
[Message 111] Liam: Woah, Chloe. Calm down.
[Message 112] Chloe: I AM CALM! Just leave me alone.
[Message 113] Maya: Fine. But if you know something, you need to tell the police. Anna and Daniel deserve justice.
[Message 114] Chloe: I don't know anything!
[Message 115] Liam: Okay, Chloe. We believe you.
[Message 116] Chloe: Good.
[Message 117] Maya: I’m going to call the police.
[Message 118] Liam: Careful.
[Message 119] Maya: I am.
[Message 120] Chloe: This is ridiculous.
[Message 121] Liam: Let her do what she needs to do, Chloe.
[Message 122] Chloe: Whatever.
[Message 123] Maya: (Later that night) Liam, police are questioning Greg.
[Message 124] Liam: Good. Hope he cracks.
[Message 125] Maya: Me too.
[Message 126] Chloe: I hope they find the real killer.
[Message 127] Liam: Me too, Chloe. Me too.
[Message 128] Maya: (A week later) Liam, the police released Greg.
[Message 129] Liam: What?! Why?
[Message 130] Maya: Not enough evidence.
[Message 131] Liam: Unbelievable.
[Message 132] Chloe: I knew he was innocent.
[Message 133] Maya: You seemed pretty sure of that, Chloe.
[Message 134] Chloe: I just had a feeling.
[Message 135] Liam: A feeling?
[Message 136] Maya: So, if they hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened. Right Chloe?
[Message 137] Chloe: What is that supposed to mean?!
[Message 138] Liam: Maya, don't push it.
[Message 139] Maya: I'm just saying... it's convenient.
[Message 140] Chloe: I resent that! I wasn't even there.
[Message 141] Liam: Alright, alright. Let's just drop it.
[Message 142] Maya: Fine. But I'm not letting this go.
[Message 143] Chloe: You're obsessed, Maya.
[Message 144] Liam: Everyone just chill.
[Message 145] Maya: She said she wanted to get rid of him. And now he's gone. Causation?
[Message 146] Chloe: You are insane!
[Message 147] Liam: Maya, stop.
[Message 148] Maya: They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 149] Chloe: Liam, tell her to stop harassing me.
[Message 150] Liam: Maya, please.
[Message 151] Maya: Fine. But I know something's up.
[Message 152] Chloe: Good riddance.
[Message 153] Liam: Let's just focus on healing.
[Message 154] Maya: I hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 157] Maya: They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 159] Liam: Think its over?
[Message 160] Maya: Almost certain that Chloe is involved.
[Message 161] Liam: How so?
[Message 162] Maya: She knew too much, too quickly. It was like she was aware.

[Message 142] Ben: ""Wonder if the humidity will be gone tomorrow.""
[Message 143] Ben: ""Probably not, knowing Scottsdale.""
[Message 144] Ben: ""Might go for a hike in the morning before it gets too hot.""
[Message 145] Ben: ""Or maybe just sleep in. Decisions, decisions...""
[Message 146] Ben: ""Think I'll check the weather one more time...""
[Message 147] Ben: ""Still shows clear skies, but who knows...""
[Message 148] Ben: ""Guess I'll just wait and see what happens.""
[Message 149] Ben: ""Maybe I should invest in a good dehumidifier.""
[Message 150] Ben: ""Yeah, that's probably a good idea.""
[Message 151] Ben: ""Alright, enough thinking about the weather.""
[Message 152] Ben: ""Time to unwind and watch a movie.""

353,"[Message 1] Jamie: Good morning, everyone! Anyone have exciting weekend plans yet?
[Message 2] Alex: Morning! Not really, Jamie. Just the usual chores, I think. Maybe some gardening if the weather is nice.
[Message 3] Sam: Morning all! I'm thinking of trying that new brunch place on Government Street. Anyone interested?
[Message 4] Jordan: Ooh, brunch sounds good, Sam! What's it called?
[Message 5] Riley: Morning! I'm actually thinking of heading out to Lake Charles for a bit of fishing.
[Message 6] Jamie: The brunch place is called ""The Magnolia Morning,"" I think. I saw some good reviews.
[Message 7] Alex: Lake Charles sounds fun, Riley. Hope you catch something!
[Message 8] Sam: I'm free Saturday morning, Jordan. We could meet around 10?
[Message 9] Jordan: That sounds perfect, Sam! 10 am at The Magnolia Morning it is.
[Message 10] Riley: Thanks, Alex! I'm hoping to. Haven't been fishing in ages.
[Message 11] Jamie: I'm planning on doing some baking this weekend. Maybe try a new sourdough recipe.
[Message 12] Alex: That sounds delicious, Jamie! You should share the recipe if it turns out well.
[Message 13] Sam: Baking sounds lovely and relaxing, Jamie. Wish I had the patience for it.
[Message 14] Jordan: I might just relax at home this weekend. Catch up on some reading.
[Message 15] Riley: Yeah, sometimes a chill weekend is exactly what's needed, Jordan.
[Message 16] Jamie: I will, Alex! It's a bit of a complicated one, but I'll simplify it.
[Message 17] Alex: Great! I love sourdough.
[Message 18] Sam: Hey, Riley, do you ever go crabbing around Lake Charles?
[Message 19] Jordan: I need to find a good new book. Any recommendations, anyone?
[Message 20] Riley: I haven't done much crabbing there, Sam, mostly just fishing. But I hear it's decent.
[Message 21] Jamie: Oh! And I also need to prep for mentoring Sarah next week.
[Message 22] Alex: Mentoring? That's great, Jamie! What's Sarah working on?
[Message 23] Sam: What kind of book are you in the mood for, Jordan?
[Message 24] Jordan: Something with a good plot, maybe a mystery or a thriller.
[Message 25] Riley: I'm reading ""The Silent Patient"" right now. Pretty good thriller, Jordan.
[Message 26] Jamie: Sarah is a junior engineer. She's having trouble with debugging complex code.
[Message 27] Alex: Debugging can be tough. Patience is key.
[Message 28] Sam: ""Gone Girl"" is a classic thriller if you haven't read that, Jordan.
[Message 29] Jordan: I've heard of ""The Silent Patient""! I'll check it out, Riley. Thanks!
[Message 30] Riley: No problem! Hope you enjoy it.
[Message 31] Jamie: Exactly, Alex. I'm trying to teach her some methodical approaches.
[Message 32] Alex: That's a good skill to learn. Breaking it down into smaller parts.
[Message 33] Sam: Methodical is definitely the way to go with debugging. I usually just end up frustrated.
[Message 34] Jordan: I'll add ""Gone Girl"" to my list, Sam. Thanks!
[Message 35] Riley: I totally agree with Sam. Debugging always makes me want to throw my computer out the window.
[Message 36] Jamie: Hahaha, I understand that feeling, Riley!
[Message 37] Alex: Coffee helps! Or tea. Whatever your preferred beverage of choice.
[Message 38] Sam: True, caffeine is a must when debugging.
[Message 39] Jordan: So, Riley, any specific spots you recommend for fishing in Lake Charles?
[Message 40] Riley: Not really, Jordan. I'm just going to wing it and try a few different spots.
[Message 41] Jamie: Okay, I need to run some errands. Talk to you all later!
[Message 42] Alex: Have a good day, Jamie!
[Message 43] Sam: Bye, Jamie!
[Message 44] Jordan: Later, Jamie!
[Message 45] Riley: Catch you later, Jamie!
[Message 46] Alex: Anyone else have exciting weekend plans beyond brunch and fishing?
[Message 47] Sam: I might try to finally get around to organizing my closet. Exciting stuff!
[Message 48] Jordan: Organization is always a good goal. I should probably do that too.
[Message 49] Riley: I need to clean my garage. It's a disaster.
[Message 50] Alex: I understand that feeling! My garage is a bit of a black hole.
[Message 51] Sam: Maybe we should all have a group organization day. Misery loves company!
[Message 52] Jordan: That's actually not a bad idea, Sam.
[Message 53] Riley: I'm in! We could make it a party. Pizza and cleaning supplies.
[Message 54] Alex: I'm game! Though I might need to borrow some cleaning supplies.
[Message 55] Sam: Alright, let's tentatively say Sunday afternoon?
[Message 56] Jordan: Sunday afternoon works for me. Whose place are we trashing… I mean, organizing?
[Message 57] Riley: Mine's the worst, so let's start with my garage.
[Message 58] Alex: Okay, Riley's garage it is!
[Message 59] Sam: Sounds like a plan! I'll bring the pizza.
[Message 60] Jordan: I can bring some drinks.
[Message 61] Riley: You guys are the best! I'll provide the cleaning supplies and the chaos.
[Message 62] Alex: Perfect! This should be… interesting.
[Message 63] Sam: It'll be fun! Or at least productive.
[Message 64] Jordan: Both! Fun and productive.
[Message 65] Riley: I'm looking forward to it! Thanks, guys.
[Message 66] Alex: No problem, Riley! Happy to help.
[Message 67] Sam: Anytime!
[Message 68] Jordan: Yeah, anytime!
[Message 69] Alex: So, back to the sourdough... any tips for a beginner, Jamie? (Once she's back, of course).
[Message 70] Sam: Good question, Alex! I'm curious too.
[Message 71] Jordan: Me too! I've always wanted to try making sourdough.
[Message 72] Riley: I just want to eat it.
[Message 73] Alex: Riley, you speak my language.
[Message 74] Sam: Haha! Riley, that's the spirit.
[Message 75] Jordan: Same, Riley. Same.
[Message 76] Riley: Sourdough toast with avocado... *drools*
[Message 77] Alex: Okay, now I'm hungry.
[Message 78] Sam: Me too! Maybe I should grab a pastry for lunch.
[Message 79] Jordan: Definitely treat yourself, Sam.
[Message 80] Riley: Yes! Treat yourself! You deserve it.
[Message 81] Alex: I think I will too. A little pick-me-up is definitely needed.
[Message 82] Sam: I think I'll go for a croissant.
[Message 83] Jordan: Ooh, good choice!
[Message 84] Riley: Almond croissant, maybe?
[Message 85] Alex: Yes, almond croissant! With a coffee.
[Message 86] Sam: You guys are enabling me. But I'm not complaining!
[Message 87] Jordan: That's what friends are for!
[Message 88] Riley: Exactly!
[Message 89] Alex: We're just looking out for your well-being.
[Message 90] Sam: I appreciate it. Alright, I'm heading out to find a croissant. Talk later!
[Message 91] Jordan: Enjoy your croissant, Sam!
[Message 92] Riley: Bye, Sam!
[Message 93] Alex: Later, Sam!
[Message 94] Alex: So, Jordan, still reading?
[Message 95] Jordan: Just browsing through some online articles. Nothing too exciting.
[Message 96] Riley: Any good news?
[Message 97] Jordan: Just the usual. Politics and stuff. I'm trying to avoid it, actually.
[Message 98] Riley: Smart move. Ignorance is bliss sometimes.
[Message 99] Alex: Definitely. I try to limit my news intake.
[Message 100] Jordan: Me too. It can be so overwhelming.
[Message 101] Riley: It really can. Especially lately.
[Message 102] Alex: So, Riley, besides fishing and garage cleaning, anything else on your agenda?
[Message 103] Riley: Maybe watch a movie. Or try to learn a new song on guitar.
[Message 104] Jordan: Oh, you play guitar? That's cool!
[Message 105] Riley: I'm terrible at it, but I enjoy it.
[Message 106] Alex: It's all about the enjoyment!
[Message 107] Jordan: Exactly! Don't worry about being perfect.
[Message 108] Riley: Thanks, guys. I appreciate that.
[Message 109] Alex: What kind of music do you like to play?
[Message 110] Riley: Mostly acoustic stuff. Folk and blues.
[Message 111] Jordan: Nice! I love folk music.
[Message 112] Alex: Me too!
[Message 113] Riley: Maybe I'll serenade you all while we're cleaning my garage.
[Message 114] Jordan: Haha! I'd be okay with that.
[Message 115] Alex: Sounds good to me!
[Message 116] Jamie: Back! Sorry, errands took longer than expected. Sourdough tips? Starter is key! Gotta nurture it like a baby.
[Message 117] Alex: Welcome back, Jamie! Nurturing like a baby... got it.
[Message 118] Sam: Jamie's back! And already giving sourdough wisdom.
[Message 119] Jordan: Welcome back, Jamie! Good to know about the starter.
[Message 120] Riley: Welcome back, Jamie! So, the starter is basically the sourdough equivalent of a Tamagotchi?
[Message 121] Jamie: Exactly, Riley! Feed it, keep it warm, talk to it... okay, maybe not the last one.
[Message 122] Alex: Talk to it! I love it!
[Message 123] Sam: Haha! I might have to try that.
[Message 124] Jordan: I'm sold. I'm talking to my sourdough starter.
[Message 125] Riley: I'm definitely going to talk to mine.
[Message 126] Jamie: Let me know if you want my starter recipe. It's been in my family for years.
[Message 127] Alex: Wow, that's amazing, Jamie! I would love that.
[Message 128] Sam: Me too! If you're willing to share.
[Message 129] Jordan: I'd love to try it too, Jamie!
[Message 130] Riley: Yes, please, Jamie!
[Message 131] Jamie: Of course! I'll send it over later today. Happy baking!
[Message 132] Alex: Thanks, Jamie! You're the best!

[Message 5] Olivia: Morning. I did, Noah. Pretty standard.
[Message 6] Liam: Standard is good, right? Keeps things…stable.
[Message 7] Chloe: Define stable.
[Message 8] Maya: Liam, you seem chipper. Something happen?
[Message 9] Liam: Just feeling good! Did… did anything happen last night?
[Message 10] Olivia: Not to me. Should something have?
[Message 11] Chloe: Depends on your definition of ""something.""
[Message 12] Liam: Right, right. Definitions. Important. So, no… revelations?
[Message 13] Noah: Revelations are between you and… the higher power.
[Message 14] Maya: Exactly. Personal journey.
[Message 15] Liam: But sharing is caring, isn't it? Even… slightly… off-kilter journeys?
[Message 16] Chloe: Sometimes sharing is… oversharing.
[Message 17] Olivia: I'm with Chloe. Boundaries, Liam.
[Message 18] Liam: Boundaries. Noted. Just curious if anyone else felt… different this morning.
[Message 19] Maya: Different how?
[Message 20] Liam: Just… lighter. Unburdened. Like a weight’s been lifted.
[Message 21] Noah: Could be the medication finally kicking in.
[Message 22] Chloe: Or lack thereof.
[Message 23] Liam: Lack? Interesting. Lack of what, exactly?
[Message 24] Chloe: Don't play coy, Liam.
[Message 25] Olivia: Guys, let’s keep it civil.
[Message 26] Liam: Civil is my middle name! (It's not).
[Message 27] Maya: Anyone want to go for a walk later?
[Message 28] Noah: I'm in. Fresh air might do some good.
[Message 29] Liam: I'd love to, but… I have some…reflecting to do.
[Message 30] Chloe: Reflecting on what, Liam?
[Message 31] Liam: Just… things. You know. Life. The universe. Everything.
[Message 32] Olivia: Deep thoughts.
[Message 33] Maya: Anyone see Dr. Evans this morning?
[Message 34] Noah: I did. Same old, same old.
[Message 35] Liam: Dr. Evans. A pillar of… consistency.
[Message 36] Chloe: Consistency can be a cage.
[Message 37] Liam: A gilded cage, perhaps? With… certain… privileges?
[Message 38] Olivia: Liam, what are you implying?
[Message 39] Liam: Implying? Me? Never. Just…observing.
[Message 40] Maya: Let’s just drop it, okay?
[Message 41] Noah: Agreed. This is getting… uncomfortable.
[Message 42] Liam: Uncomfortable? Why? Unless… someone has something to hide?
[Message 43] Chloe: Everyone has something to hide, Liam. That's called being human.
[Message 44] Olivia: Exactly. Personal boundaries, remember?
[Message 45] Liam: Right, boundaries. Of course. But what about… shared responsibility?
[Message 46] Maya: Responsibility for what?
[Message 47] Liam: For…keeping the peace. Maintaining…order.
[Message 48] Noah: Sounds like you're talking about the staff.
[Message 49] Liam: Am I? Maybe. Or maybe I'm talking about… ourselves.
[Message 50] Chloe: You're being cryptic, Liam.
[Message 51] Liam: Cryptic? I'm just… asking questions.
[Message 52] Olivia: Too many questions.
[Message 53] Maya: Yeah, dial it back a bit, Liam.
[Message 54] Liam: Duly noted. But if something…did…happen, hypothetically speaking…would anyone say anything?
[Message 55] Noah: Hypothetically, it depends on what ""it"" is.
[Message 56] Chloe: And who ""it"" involves.
[Message 57] Liam: Point taken. So… mum's the word?
[Message 58] Olivia: If there’s nothing to tell.
[Message 59] Maya: Precisely. Nothing to tell.
[Message 60] Liam: Not even… a little whisper? A tiny hint?
[Message 61] Chloe: Zip it, Liam.
[Message 62] Noah: Some things are best left…unsaid.
[Message 63] Liam: But… what if not saying them is… worse?
[Message 64] Olivia: Worse for whom?
[Message 65] Maya: Let's change the subject. Anyone read anything good lately?
[Message 66] Liam: A classic deflection. Well played, Maya.
[Message 67] Chloe: Just trying to keep the peace, Liam.
[Message 68] Liam: Peace at what cost?
[Message 69] Noah: Cost of sanity, maybe?
[Message 70] Olivia: Cost of staying here, possibly.
[Message 71] Maya: Exactly. So, books? Anyone?
[Message 72] Liam: I’ve been reading the… faces around me. Very… revealing.
[Message 73] Chloe: You're going to give yourself a headache, Liam.
[Message 74] Noah: Agreed. Relax a bit.
[Message 75] Olivia: Seriously. We're supposed to be de-stressing.
[Message 76] Maya: Maybe we should all just meditate for a bit.
[Message 77] Liam: Meditate on… what, exactly? Our collective… silence?
[Message 78] Chloe: Meditate on breathing, Liam. Just breathe.
[Message 79] Noah: Yeah, focus on the present.
[Message 80] Olivia: Forget about last night.
[Message 81] Maya: Move on.
[Message 82] Liam: Easier said than done, perhaps? Especially when… certain images… linger.
[Message 83] Chloe: Images are fleeting, Liam.
[Message 84] Noah: They fade.
[Message 85] Olivia: They lose their power.
[Message 86] Maya: Just let them go.
[Message 87] Liam: I'll try. But if anyone… remembers anything… feel free to… share. Or not. Whatever.
[Message 88] Chloe: We got it, Liam.
[Message 89] Noah: Loud and clear.
[Message 90] Olivia: Message received.
[Message 91] Maya: Okay, I'm going for that walk. Anyone coming?
[Message 92] Noah: I'm still in.
[Message 93] Chloe: I need some air.
[Message 94] Olivia: Me too. See you guys outside.
[Message 95] Liam: Enjoy your… stroll. May you find… clarity. Or not.

[Message 2] Riley: Hey Alex! I'm thinking about seeing that indie band, ""Crimson Echoes,"" next month. You heard of them?
[Message 3] Jordan: Crimson Echoes? Vaguely. What kind of music is it?
[Message 4] Riley: Kind of dreamy, atmospheric stuff. Indie rock, I guess.
[Message 5] Casey: Concerts sound fun. I’ve been meaning to check out the local music scene more.
[Message 6] Taylor: I'm always up for a good concert! Anything specific in mind, Casey?
[Message 7] Casey: Not really, just open to suggestions. Maybe something more on the chill side.
[Message 8] Alex: Chill? Maybe check out ""Sundown Serenade."" They're playing at The Low Key Lounge next week.
[Message 9] Jordan: Sundown Serenade? Sounds relaxing!
[Message 10] Taylor: The Low Key Lounge is a cool venue too. I went there once for a jazz night.
[Message 11] Riley: Jazz! I haven't been to a good jazz concert in ages.
[Message 12] Casey: Jazz does sound good. I could be persuaded!
[Message 13] Alex: I know right? It's so calming after a long day.
[Message 14] Jordan: Speaking of calming, has anyone seen the sunset lately? El Paso sunsets are amazing.
[Message 15] Taylor: True! The colors are incredible. Okay, back to concerts – anyone seen ""Electric Fury"" before?
[Message 16] Alex: Electric Fury? That’s a little too intense for me, haha.
[Message 17] Riley: They’re pretty loud! But a fun mosh pit if you’re into that.
[Message 18] Casey: Mosh pits are definitely not my scene.
[Message 19] Jordan: I'd rather enjoy the music from a safe distance, thanks.
[Message 20] Taylor: Fair enough! Different strokes for different folks.
[Message 21] Alex: What about that country music festival coming up? Anyone interested?
[Message 22] Riley: Country isn't really my thing.
[Message 23] Jordan: I could be convinced if the lineup is good.
[Message 24] Casey: I used to go to a lot of country concerts back in the day.
[Message 25] Taylor: I'm always down for country! Let me see the lineup.
[Message 26] Alex: Let me find it. Give me a sec... Okay, headliners are ""Dusty Trails"" and ""Southern Comfort.""
[Message 27] Riley: Dusty Trails? I've heard of them.
[Message 28] Jordan: Southern Comfort... hmm, not ringing a bell.
[Message 29] Casey: ""Dusty Trails"" is really good! They put on a great show.
[Message 30] Taylor: Ooh, I like ""Dusty Trails""! Okay, I'm leaning towards going.
[Message 31] Alex: Awesome! We should coordinate.
[Message 32] Riley: I’ll probably pass on the country fest, but let me know if you guys go to that indie show!
[Message 33] Jordan: Will do, Riley!
[Message 34] Casey: Yeah, I'll keep you posted.
[Message 35] Taylor: Sounds good!
[Message 36] Alex: Hey Jordan, how’s that presentation you were working on coming along?
[Message 37] Jordan: It's getting there. Just need to polish it up a bit. Thanks for asking!
[Message 38] Taylor: Any tips for giving a good presentation? I have one next week and I’m nervous.
[Message 39] Casey: Practice in front of a mirror! It helps.
[Message 40] Riley: Definitely practice! And try to make eye contact with people in the audience.
[Message 41] Jordan: Focus on your key points and try not to read directly from your notes. And remember to breathe!
[Message 42] Alex: Good luck, Taylor! You'll do great.
[Message 43] Taylor: Thanks, everyone! I appreciate the advice.
[Message 44] Riley: No problem! Now back to concerts – anyone heard of ""Neon Shadows""? They're supposed to be up and coming.
[Message 45] Jordan: ""Neon Shadows""... sounds intriguing. What genre are they?
[Message 46] Casey: I think I saw them mentioned in a blog post. Electronic, maybe?
[Message 47] Taylor: Electronic isn't usually my thing, but I'm open to trying new things.
[Message 48] Alex: I'll check them out on Spotify later. Thanks for the recommendation, Riley!
[Message 49] Riley: No problem! Always on the lookout for new music.
[Message 50] Jordan: Me too! It's so easy to get stuck in a rut.
[Message 51] Casey: True. Stepping outside your comfort zone is always a good thing.
[Message 52] Taylor: Totally agree!
[Message 53] Alex: What other venues are good around here besides The Low Key Lounge?
[Message 54] Riley: There's The Sound Garden. They have a good mix of bands.
[Message 55] Jordan: And The Garage. It's smaller, but they often have local acts.
[Message 56] Casey: The Plaza Theater sometimes has concerts too, if it's a bigger act.
[Message 57] Taylor: Good to know! I'll have to check those out.
[Message 58] Alex: Awesome, thanks for the tips, everyone! I’m making a list.
[Message 59] Riley: No problem! Happy concert-going!
[Message 60] Jordan: Have fun everyone!",0,

357,"[Message 1] Agnes: ""Ugh, this park bench is SO uncomfortable. My back is killing me.""
[Message 2] Alex: ""Yeah, they could definitely invest in some better benches. Maybe with a little lumbar support?""
[Message 3] Quinn: ""I agree. Public benches are often an afterthought. Although, the view here is lovely.""
[Message 4] Agnes: ""The view *is* nice, I'll give you that. But seriously, I'm going to need a chiropractor after this.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Speaking of discomfort, has anyone else noticed how loud the traffic is, even here in the park?""
[Message 6] Quinn: ""Always a problem in LA, I'm afraid. Noise pollution is real.""
[Message 7] Agnes: ""Don't even get me started on noise pollution. Back in my day...""
[Message 8] Alex: ""Oh, here we go! Agnes and her 'back in my day' stories! Just kidding (mostly).""
[Message 9] Agnes: ""It's true! People were more considerate then! Fewer leaf blowers, less honking...""
[Message 10] Quinn: ""I think people are just more stressed now, Agnes. Everything is so fast-paced.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""True. It's hard to relax when you feel like you're constantly behind.""
[Message 12] Agnes: ""Well, maybe if they had better benches, people could actually relax!""
[Message 13] Quinn: ""Ha! You're persistent, Agnes.""
[Message 14] Alex: ""So, about that trip we were planning… any thoughts on where we should go?""
[Message 15] Agnes: ""Somewhere with comfortable seating, preferably!""
[Message 16] Quinn: ""Somewhere quiet, perhaps? Maybe a cabin in the mountains?""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Ooh, I like that idea! Somewhere with hiking trails, too?""
[Message 18] Agnes: ""Hiking sounds lovely. As long as there are places to rest along the way.""
[Message 19] Quinn: ""We can definitely factor in rest stops, Agnes. I promise.""
[Message 20] Alex: ""Okay, mountains with hiking. What about dates? When are we thinking of going?""
[Message 21] Agnes: ""Whenever this bench stops hurting my back!""
[Message 22] Quinn: ""Agnes! You're incorrigible! How about next month?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Next month works for me. I'll check my schedule.""
[Message 24] Agnes: ""As long as the cabin has comfortable chairs, I'm in.""
[Message 25] Quinn: ""It will, Agnes. I'll make sure of it.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""Speaking of comfortable chairs, I need to replace the one in my living room. Any recommendations?""
[Message 27] Agnes: ""I got a great one at that furniture store on La Brea. Comfy AND stylish.""
[Message 28] Quinn: ""Oh, that's the one with the really interesting modern designs, right?""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Yeah, I think I know the one. I'll have to check it out.""
[Message 30] Agnes: ""Tell them Agnes sent you. Maybe they'll give you a discount!""
[Message 31] Quinn: ""Doubtful, Agnes. But it's worth a try!""
[Message 32] Alex: ""Haha, will do. Thanks!""
[Message 33] Agnes: ""Anyway, back to my complaints… The pigeons! They're everywhere!""
[Message 34] Quinn: ""They are a bit persistent, aren't they?""
[Message 35] Alex: ""They're just looking for a snack. We're probably surrounded by crumbs.""
[Message 36] Agnes: ""Well, someone should do something about it. They're a nuisance!""
[Message 37] Quinn: ""Maybe the city has a pigeon control program?""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Possibly. Or maybe we should just move to a different bench.""
[Message 39] Agnes: ""That's actually a good idea. Let's find one that's pigeon-free and slightly less uncomfortable.""
[Message 40] Quinn: ""Agreed. Let's go.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Lead the way!""
[Message 42] Agnes: ""And if we find a good one, we should write a letter to the city complaining about the benches that aren't up to par.""
[Message 43] Quinn: ""You're a woman on a mission, Agnes.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""A woman who knows what she wants… a comfortable bench.""
[Message 45] Agnes: ""Exactly!""
[Message 46] Quinn: ""Okay, okay, let's go. Before my legs fall asleep on this…unpleasant seating arrangement.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Alright, moving on!""
[Message 48] Agnes: ""I wonder if that cabin we're renting has a good porch swing…""
[Message 49] Quinn: ""I'll make sure it does, Agnes. Consider it done!""
[Message 50] Alex: ""Porch swing sounds amazing right now.""
[Message 51] Agnes: ""Speaking of amazing...did you see that sunset last night? Incredible!""
[Message 52] Quinn: ""I missed it! Was it really spectacular?""
[Message 53] Alex: ""It was breathtaking. Deep oranges and purples.""
[Message 54] Agnes: ""The best sunset I've seen in months.""
[Message 55] Quinn: ""I'll try to catch it tonight. Thanks for the heads up.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""You should! It's a nice way to end the day.""
[Message 57] Agnes: ""Unless you're sitting on an uncomfortable park bench.""
[Message 58] Quinn: ""Agnes!""
[Message 59] Alex: ""You just can't let it go, can you?""
[Message 60] Agnes: ""Nope! I'm a woman of principle! And comfortable seating!""
[Message 61] Quinn: ""Fair enough.""
[Message 62] Alex: ""So, back to the cabin… what kind of activities are we thinking of doing besides hiking and porch-swinging?""
[Message 63] Agnes: ""Bird watching, perhaps? It's very relaxing.""
[Message 64] Quinn: ""I'd be up for that. I haven't really done any bird watching before.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Sounds peaceful. I could use some peace and quiet.""
[Message 66] Agnes: ""And maybe we could play some board games in the evening?""
[Message 67] Quinn: ""That sounds fun! I'll bring a few.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Perfect! I'll bring the snacks.""
[Message 69] Agnes: ""Don't forget the comfortable blankets!""
[Message 70] Quinn: ""Of course, Agnes. Comfort is key.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Absolutely.""
[Message 72] Agnes: ""You know, this conversation is making me look forward to this trip even more.""
[Message 73] Quinn: ""Me too! It'll be a nice escape.""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Definitely. I'm already feeling more relaxed just thinking about it.""
[Message 75] Agnes: ""Although, I'll be even more relaxed when we're not sitting on this atrocious bench.""
[Message 76] Quinn: ""We're getting there, Agnes! Patience, my friend.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Speaking of patience, I need to have some patience with my neighbor. He's been playing his music really loud lately.""
[Message 78] Agnes: ""Oh, I hate noisy neighbors! They're the worst!""
[Message 79] Quinn: ""Have you talked to him about it, Alex?""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Not yet. I'm trying to be polite, but it's getting on my nerves.""
[Message 81] Agnes: ""You should definitely say something. Politely but firmly.""
[Message 82] Quinn: ""Agreed. Don't let it fester. It'll just make you more stressed.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Okay, I'll try to talk to him tomorrow. Thanks for the advice.""
[Message 84] Agnes: ""Good luck! And remember, a little firmness goes a long way.""
[Message 85] Quinn: ""Indeed.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Alright, I'll channel my inner Agnes.""
[Message 87] Agnes: ""Haha! Good! Now, let's find a better bench!""
[Message 88] Quinn: ""Still on that, huh?""
[Message 89] Alex: ""She's relentless.""
[Message 90] Agnes: ""Someone has to be! Think of all the other people suffering on these awful benches!""
[Message 91] Quinn: ""Okay, okay. You've convinced me.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""Let's go, let's go.""
[Message 93] Agnes: ""Finally!""
[Message 94] Quinn: ""I see one over there that looks promising. It's got a backrest, at least.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""Ooh, a backrest! That's a major upgrade.""
[Message 96] Agnes: ""Let's check it out!""
[Message 97] Quinn: ""This one *does* seem a little better. Less wobbly, too.""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Yeah, the wood feels a bit smoother.""
[Message 99] Agnes: ""Hm... it's still not perfect, but it's definitely an improvement.""
[Message 100] Quinn: ""Baby steps, Agnes. Baby steps.""
[Message 101] Alex: ""So, slightly better bench. Success!""
[Message 102] Agnes: ""I suppose so. But the city still needs to do something about the others!""
[Message 103] Quinn: ""We'll write that letter, Agnes. We promise.""
[Message 104] Alex: ""First, let's enjoy this slightly less uncomfortable bench.""
[Message 105] Agnes: ""Fair enough. Let's talk more about the cabin. What about the kitchen? Is it well-equipped?""
[Message 106] Quinn: ""I checked the listing. It says it has all the basics: pots, pans, dishes, utensils.""
[Message 107] Alex: ""That's good. I was hoping to do some cooking.""
[Message 108] Agnes: ""Maybe we could make a big pot of soup one night?""
[Message 109] Quinn: ""That sounds lovely, Agnes! What kind of soup?""
[Message 110] Alex: ""Ooh, maybe a vegetable soup? Or a hearty chili?""
[Message 111] Agnes: ""A nice vegetable soup would be perfect. Comforting and healthy.""
[Message 112] Quinn: ""I can bring some fresh herbs from my garden to add to it.""
[Message 113] Alex: ""That would be amazing! Fresh herbs make all the difference.""
[Message 114] Agnes: ""See? This trip is going to be wonderful! Comfortable seating, good food, good company.""
[Message 115] Quinn: ""I agree completely!""
[Message 116] Alex: ""Definitely something to look forward to.""
[Message 117] Agnes: ""Now, if only this bench were just a *little* bit softer...""
[Message 118] Quinn: ""Agnes! We just moved!""
[Message 119] Alex: ""Give it a rest!""
[Message 120] Agnes: ""I'm just saying! A little padding wouldn't hurt!""
[Message 121] Quinn: ""Maybe we can bring a cushion with us next time?""
[Message 122] Alex: ""That's a good idea! A portable bench cushion!""
[Message 123] Agnes: ""Now you're talking!""
[Message 124] Quinn: ""I think I have one in my garage somewhere. I'll look for it.""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Awesome! You're the best, Quinn.""
[Message 126] Agnes: ""Yes, thank you, Quinn! You're a lifesaver!""
[Message 127] Quinn: ""You're welcome! I'm happy to help.""
[Message 128] Alex: ""So, cushion aside, anything else we need to plan for the trip?""
[Message 129] Agnes: ""We should probably check the weather forecast closer to the date.""
[Message 130] Quinn: ""Good point. I'll keep an eye on it.""
[Message 131] Alex: ""And we should make a list of things to pack.""
[Message 132] Agnes: ""Don't forget a good book to read by the fire!""
[Message 133] Quinn: ""Definitely! I've been meaning to read that new mystery novel.""
[Message 134] Alex: ""Ooh, sounds good! I'll bring a deck of cards.""
[Message 135] Agnes: ""Perfect! We'll have plenty to keep us entertained.""
[Message 136] Quinn: ""This is going to be so much fun!""
[Message 137] Alex: ""I can't wait!""
[Message 138] Agnes: ""As long as the seating arrangements are satisfactory!""
[Message 139] Quinn: ""We're on it, Agnes! We're on it!""
[Message 140] Alex: ""Haha! Okay, okay. Speaking of satisfactory, I'm craving ice cream all of a sudden.""
[Message 141] Agnes: ""Ice cream sounds wonderful! Especially on a warm day like this.""
[Message 142] Quinn: ""There's that ice cream shop just down the street, right?""
[Message 143] Alex: ""Yeah! Let's go!""
[Message 144] Agnes: ""Sounds like a plan! But can we walk slowly? My back is still a little stiff.""
[Message 145] Quinn: ""Of course, Agnes. We'll take it easy.""
[Message 146] Alex: ""No problem at all. Ice cream awaits!""
[Message 147] Agnes: ""Excellent! Lead the way!""
[Message 148] Quinn: ""Alright, let's go get some ice cream and forget about uncomfortable benches for a little while.""
[Message 149] Alex: ""Sounds like a perfect plan to me.""
[Message 150] Agnes: ""Agreed! Ice cream will definitely improve my mood.""
[Message 151] Quinn: ""What flavors are you thinking of getting?""
[Message 152] Alex: ""I'm in the mood for something chocolatey.""
[Message 153] Agnes: ""I think I'll go for a classic vanilla. You can't go wrong with vanilla.""
[Message 154] Quinn: ""I might try something a little more adventurous. Maybe a salted caramel?""
[Message 155] Alex: ""Ooh, that sounds delicious!""
[Message 156] Agnes: ""We all deserve a treat after enduring those park benches!""
[Message 157] Quinn: ""Absolutely!""
[Message 158] Alex: ""Let's go! I can almost taste the ice cream already.""
[Message 159] Agnes: ""Onward, to ice cream and slightly better seating arrangements at the ice cream shop!""
[Message 160] Quinn: ""You're amazing, Agnes.""
[Message 161] Alex: ""She's one of a kind.""
[Message 162] Agnes: ""Just a woman who appreciates comfort and good ice cream.""
[Message 163] Quinn: ""And we appreciate you, Agnes!""
[Message 164] Alex: ""Definitely! Now, let's get that ice cream!""
[Message 165] Agnes: ""Let's go!""
[Message 166] Quinn: ""Ice cream, here we come!""
[Message 167] Alex: ""Hopefully, the ice cream shop has comfortable chairs!""
[Message 168] Agnes: ""That's the spirit!""
[Message 169] Quinn: ""Cross your fingers!""
[Message 170] Alex: ""Okay, walking towards ice cream and comfortable seating!""
[Message 171] Agnes: ""A perfect end to a slightly uncomfortable afternoon.""
[Message 172] Quinn: ""Couldn't agree more!""
[Message 173] Alex: ""Let's get this ice cream!""
[Message 174] Agnes: ""Vanilla, here I come!""
[Message 175] Quinn: ""Salted caramel, be mine!""
[Message 176] Alex: ""Chocolate, let's do this!""
[Message 177] Agnes: ""Ice cream!""

[Message 2] Ben: ""Yep. Flight delayed. Ugh.""
[Message 3] Chris: ""Tell me about it. At least there's wifi.""
[Message 4] Dana: ""True. Thinking of trying that new mobile game everyone's talking about – 'Cosmic Crusaders'.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Cosmic Crusaders? Heard it's a bit of a time sink.""
[Message 6] Ben: ""Time sink is my middle name right now. What's it like?""
[Message 7] Dana: ""It's an RPG, gacha mechanics, pretty standard fare but the art style is gorgeous.""
[Message 8] Chris: ""Gacha, huh? I'm immediately wary. Those things can get expensive.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Yeah, I tend to avoid those types of games. Too tempting to spend money.""
[Message 10] Ben: ""I just want something to kill time. I'm usually watching TV on the road, but no TV here obviously.""
[Message 11] Dana: ""Fair enough. Maybe try 'Stardew Valley' on your phone, Ben? Relaxing farming sim.""
[Message 12] Chris: ""Stardew Valley is amazing. Highly recommend. Very chill.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Seconded on Stardew. Great game for unwinding.""
[Message 14] Ben: ""Farming, huh? I'll look into it. Better than staring at the ceiling.""
[Message 15] Dana: ""Or each other! Haha.""
[Message 16] Chris: ""Haha, true. So, anyone ever been on a really awkward first date?""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Oh boy, you're opening a can of worms, Chris!""
[Message 18] Ben: ""I wouldn't know. Been with my wife for 30 years. Dating is another world to me.""
[Message 19] Dana: ""Lucky you, Ben! I went on one where the guy spent the entire time talking about his stamp collection.""
[Message 20] Chris: ""Ouch. That's rough. I had one where the girl brought her mother along.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""No way! That's... a choice.""
[Message 22] Ben: ""His mother?!?!""
[Message 23] Dana: ""Seriously? Did she even order anything?""
[Message 24] Chris: ""Yep. She ordered a full meal and gave me dating advice. It was surreal.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""I think you win the awkward date award, Chris.""
[Message 26] Ben: ""Definitely. I'd rather be delayed than go through that.""
[Message 27] Dana: ""Okay, new topic! Back to games. Any thoughts on the new Zelda?""
[Message 28] Chris: ""Tears of the Kingdom? Absolutely loved it. Exploration is top-notch.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""I'm still working my way through it. So much to do!""
[Message 30] Ben: ""Zelda? Is that the one with the pointy-eared guy?""
[Message 31] Dana: ""Haha, yes, Ben. That's the one. Link, the hero.""
[Message 32] Chris: ""You should give it a try sometime, Ben! It's a classic.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Definitely agree. It's a masterpiece.""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Maybe I will. After I finish 'Stardew Valley', that is... if I ever start it!""
[Message 35] Dana: ""Baby steps, Ben! One game at a time.""
[Message 36] Chris: ""Anyone else hyped for the new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth?""
[Message 37] Alex: ""SO HYPED. Pre-ordered it months ago.""
[Message 38] Dana: ""Me too! The trailers look incredible.""
[Message 39] Ben: ""Final... what now?""
[Message 40] Chris: ""Final Fantasy. It's a role-playing game series, Ben. Very popular.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Think Star Wars, but with swords and magic.""
[Message 42] Dana: ""And spiky hair.""
[Message 43] Ben: ""Okay, I'm starting to get the picture. Still sounds complicated.""
[Message 44] Chris: ""It can be, but it's also very rewarding. Great story and characters.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Agreed. The story is what really pulls you in.""
[Message 46] Dana: ""Okay, shifting gears slightly. Anyone else finding it hard to concentrate with all the airport noise?""
[Message 47] Ben: ""You're telling me. I'm practically vibrating.""
[Message 48] Chris: ""Headphones are a lifesaver. I brought mine specifically for this reason.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Good call. I should have thought of that.""
[Message 50] Dana: ""Me too. Regretting my life choices right now.""
[Message 51] Chris: ""So, Alex, what are your go-to mobile games?""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Lately, I've been playing 'Monument Valley'. It's a puzzle game with really beautiful visuals.""
[Message 53] Ben: ""Puzzle games? Sounds too much like work to me.""
[Message 54] Dana: ""Haha, I get that, Ben. I prefer something a little more action-packed.""
[Message 55] Chris: ""Like what, Dana?""
[Message 56] Dana: ""'Call of Duty: Mobile' is my guilty pleasure.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Whoa, hardcore!""
[Message 58] Ben: ""Definitely not my thing.""
[Message 59] Chris: ""I've dabbled in it. Pretty intense for a mobile game.""
[Message 60] Alex: ""Anyone try 'Genshin Impact'?""
[Message 61] Dana: ""Played it for a while, but the grind got to me.""
[Message 62] Chris: ""Yeah, it's a huge time commitment.""
[Message 63] Ben: ""Sounds like all these games are huge time commitments!""
[Message 64] Alex: ""True, but it beats being bored out of my mind.""
[Message 65] Dana: ""Agreed. It's a good distraction.""
[Message 66] Chris: ""Hey, anyone know if there's a good coffee shop around here?""
[Message 67] Alex: ""I think there's one down the street, but I'm not sure if it's any good.""
[Message 68] Ben: ""Coffee sounds amazing right now.""
[Message 69] Dana: ""Me too. Caffeine withdrawal is setting in.""
[Message 70] Chris: ""Alright, let's make a pact. If our flights get delayed any longer, we're all going for coffee.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Deal!""
[Message 72] Ben: ""I'm in.""
[Message 73] Dana: ""You got it!""
[Message 74] Chris: ""So, back to games... any recommendations for a good strategy game?""
[Message 75] Alex: ""'Civilization VI' is always a solid choice.""
[Message 76] Dana: ""'XCOM 2' is challenging but rewarding.""
[Message 77] Ben: ""Are those on phones too?""
[Message 78] Chris: ""Civilization VI is, yes. Not sure about XCOM 2.""
[Message 79] Alex: ""XCOM 2 is also on mobile, I think.""
[Message 80] Dana: ""Yep, both are available on iOS and Android.""
[Message 81] Ben: ""Huh. Learn something new every day.""
[Message 82] Chris: ""Alright, I think I'm going to check the flight status again.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Good idea. Let us know if there's any change.""
[Message 84] Dana: ""Fingers crossed it's good news.""
[Message 85] Ben: ""Hopefully we can all get out of here soon.""
[Message 86] Chris: ""Just checked. Still delayed. Sigh.""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Well, that's disappointing.""
[Message 88] Dana: ""Time for more games, then!""
[Message 89] Ben: ""Looks like it.""
[Message 90] Chris: ""Anyone ever played 'Disco Elysium'?""
[Message 91] Alex: ""Heard good things, but haven't gotten around to it.""
[Message 92] Dana: ""Same here. It's on my list.""
[Message 93] Ben: ""Disco... what now?""
[Message 94] Chris: ""It's a detective RPG. Very story-driven and unique.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""I heard the writing is amazing.""
[Message 96] Dana: ""Yeah, that's what I've heard too. Maybe I'll pick it up.""
[Message 97] Ben: ""Well, I'm sticking with farming. Seems less stressful.""

[Message 2] Ben: Tell me about it, Alex. I'm already dreaming of weekend relaxation.
[Message 3] Carol: Yeah, a break would be nice. I was thinking of redecorating my living room. Anyone got any good ideas?
[Message 4] David: Redecorating? That sounds like a fun project, Carol! What style are you going for?
[Message 5] Emily: I’m in! Redecorating is my jam! Do you have a Pinterest board yet, Carol?
[Message 6] Carol: Not yet, Emily! But I'm leaning towards something cozy and modern. Think lots of natural light and comfy textures.
[Message 7] Alex: Cozy sounds nice. Maybe some earth tones?
[Message 8] Ben: Earth tones are always a safe bet, Alex. Timeless.
[Message 9] David: I agree with Alex. Earth tones for a cozy feel, Carol. Also, plants! Plants are a must.
[Message 10] Emily: Ooh, yes! Plants are essential. Snake plants are low maintenance and look great!
[Message 11] Carol: I love the plant idea! Thanks, guys! Any suggestions for furniture?
[Message 12] Alex: Depends on your budget, Carol. But I've seen some great deals at the local antique shops.
[Message 13] Ben: Antique shops are good for unique finds. Just be prepared to haggle!
[Message 14] David: Or IKEA, if you want something more affordable and modern.
[Message 15] Emily: Don’t forget Facebook Marketplace! You can find amazing stuff for cheap there.
[Message 16] Carol: I hadn’t even thought about Facebook Marketplace! Thanks, Emily!
[Message 17] Alex: Speaking of affordable, anyone know where I can get some decent camping gear on a budget?
[Message 18] Ben: Try Academy Sports, Alex. They usually have sales.
[Message 19] David: I second Academy. Good prices for decent quality.
[Message 20] Emily: Let’s get back to Carol's living room! What about a statement rug?
[Message 21] Carol: A statement rug... I like the sound of that! What color?
[Message 22] Alex: Something that complements the earth tones, maybe a muted blue or green?
[Message 23] Ben: A geometric pattern could add some visual interest.
[Message 24] David: Or a vintage Persian rug for a touch of elegance.
[Message 25] Emily: Ooh, vintage Persian! Classy! Check out Etsy for those.
[Message 26] Carol: Etsy, got it! You guys are giving me so many good ideas!
[Message 27] Alex: No problem, Carol! Happy to help. Just trying to avoid thinking about work!
[Message 28] Ben: Haha, I understand that, Alex.
[Message 29] David: Me too. Anything to distract from the endless spreadsheets.
[Message 30] Emily: Speaking of distractions, did anyone catch that new song by Aurora?
[Message 31] Carol: Not yet, Emily! Is it good?
[Message 32] Alex: I haven't heard it either. I'll have to check it out.
[Message 33] Ben: I'm more of a classic rock kind of guy, myself.
[Message 34] David: I listen to everything! Music is life.
[Message 35] Emily: It’s amazing, Carol! Very ethereal and calming. Perfect for redecorating vibes.
[Message 36] Carol: I'll add it to my playlist!
[Message 37] Alex: Back to the living room… what about lighting?
[Message 38] Ben: Good point, Alex. Lighting is crucial.
[Message 39] David: Warm, ambient lighting is key for a cozy feel.
[Message 40] Emily: String lights! I love string lights!
[Message 41] Carol: String lights are always a good idea! Maybe some fairy lights around the windows?
[Message 42] Alex: Or some floor lamps to create a soft glow.
[Message 43] Ben: Task lighting is important too, especially if you read in the living room.
[Message 44] David: Agreed, Ben. A nice reading lamp next to the sofa.
[Message 45] Emily: You could even get those smart bulbs that you can control with your phone!
[Message 46] Carol: Smart bulbs! That's a great idea, Emily!
[Message 47] Alex: I'm feeling inspired to reorganize my camping gear now.
[Message 48] Ben: Haha, one thing at a time, Alex!
[Message 49] David: Yeah, let's focus on Carol's living room for now.
[Message 50] Emily: What about throw pillows? How many is too many?
[Message 51] Carol: That's a good question, Emily! I'm not sure!
[Message 52] Alex: I think it depends on the size of your sofa.
[Message 53] Ben: And the pattern of the pillows.
[Message 54] David: I say, the more the merrier! But I might be biased.
[Message 55] Emily: I agree with David! You can never have too many throw pillows!
[Message 56] Carol: Okay, okay! I'll go crazy with the throw pillows!
[Message 57] Alex: Just don't bury yourself under them!
[Message 58] Ben: Haha! That would be a sight to see.
[Message 59] David: Picturing that now!
[Message 60] Emily: Maybe a mix of textures and sizes?
[Message 61] Carol: Definitely! Some velvet, some linen…
[Message 62] Alex: Don’t forget about curtains or blinds!
[Message 63] Ben: That’s right. Window coverings can make a big difference.
[Message 64] David: Light and airy curtains would be perfect for a modern, cozy look.
[Message 65] Emily: Or some bamboo blinds for a natural touch!
[Message 66] Carol: Bamboo blinds... I like that!
[Message 67] Alex: Okay, I'm officially jealous of your redecorating project, Carol.
[Message 68] Ben: Me too! I might need to do some sprucing up myself.
[Message 69] David: Let's all have a redecorating party!
[Message 70] Emily: I’m in! Decorating party sounds amazing!
[Message 71] Carol: That would be so much fun!
[Message 72] Alex: I'm terrible at decorating, but I can bring the snacks!
[Message 73] Ben: I can bring the drinks!
[Message 74] David: And I can bring the music!
[Message 75] Emily: I can bring my extensive collection of throw pillows!
[Message 76] Carol: Perfect! Let’s plan this for next weekend?
[Message 77] Alex: Sounds good to me!
[Message 78] Ben: I’m free next weekend.
[Message 79] David: Count me in!
[Message 80] Emily: I’m so excited!
[Message 81] Carol: Awesome! I'll send out a calendar invite later.
[Message 82] Alex: Great! In the meantime, back to the grind. Ugh.
[Message 83] Ben: Tell me about it. These spreadsheets aren't going to fill themselves.
[Message 84] David: Just remember the redecorating party is coming up!
[Message 85] Emily: Yes! That’s what’s keeping me going!
[Message 86] Carol: Me too! Thanks for all the inspiration, everyone!
[Message 87] Alex: No problem, Carol!
[Message 88] Ben: Anytime!
[Message 89] David: Happy to help!
[Message 90] Emily: We're here for you, Carol!
[Message 91] Carol: You guys are the best!
[Message 92] Alex: Just remember to take pictures of the finished product!
[Message 93] Ben: Yes, we need to see the transformation!
[Message 94] David: Before and after pics are a must!
[Message 95] Emily: Definitely! We demand photo evidence!
[Message 96] Carol: Haha, I will! I promise!
[Message 97] Alex: Okay, gotta run. See you all later!
[Message 98] Ben: Bye, Alex!
[Message 99] David: Later, Alex!
[Message 100] Emily: Have a good one, Alex!
[Message 101] Carol: See you, Alex! Thanks again!

[Message 77] Chloe: ""Liam, stop.""
[Message 78] Liam: ""I can't help it! What if someone intended for Thompson to be hurt?""
[Message 79] Asher: ""Who would do that?""
[Message 80] Chloe: ""Exactly! Stop with the conspiracy theories.""
[Message 81] Liam: ""I'm not saying it's a conspiracy! Just... maybe someone had a reason.""
[Message 82] Asher: ""Everyone has a reason for something.""
[Message 83] Chloe: ""Okay, this is going nowhere. Movie, remember?""
[Message 84] Liam: ""Fine, movie.""
[Message 85] Asher: ""See you soon.""
[Message 86] Chloe: ""Bye.""
[Message 87] Liam: ""Anyone else think the Museum is kind of creepy?""
[Message 88] Asher: ""It's a museum, Liam.""
[Message 89] Chloe: ""Yeah, that's its job.""
[Message 90] Liam: ""I don't know, something about it gives me the creeps.""
[Message 91] Asher: ""You're being paranoid.""

[Message 102] Liam: ""Thanks. I appreciate that.""

[Message 108] Liam: ""Okay, movie!""
[Message 109] Asher: ""See you soon.""
[Message 110] Chloe: ""Later!""
[Message 111] Liam: ""Hey, quick question. Does anyone know if Thompson was sick or anything?""
[Message 112] Asher: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 113] Chloe: ""Yeah, that's kind of a weird thing to ask.""
[Message 114] Liam: ""I heard someone at work saying he was having health problems. That it was a mercy killing to end suffering.""
[Message 115] Asher: ""That's a pretty serious accusation, Liam.""
[Message 116] Chloe: ""Yeah, don't spread rumors like that.""
[Message 117] Liam: ""I'm not! I just heard it. It might be important.""
[Message 118] Asher: ""Unless you have proof, it's just gossip.""
[Message 119] Chloe: ""Exactly. Let it go.""
[Message 120] Liam: ""Fine, fine. Just thought I'd mention it.""
[Message 121] Asher: ""Okay, well, thanks for sharing. Now, movie?""
[Message 122] Chloe: ""Yes, please!""
[Message 123] Liam: ""Alright, movie it is.""
[Message 124] Asher: ""See you soon.""
[Message 125] Chloe: ""Later!""
[Message 126] Liam: ""Did anyone know that Thompson was about to rule on a big case involving a real estate deal?""
[Message 127] Asher: ""No, I didn't.""
[Message 128] Chloe: ""Me neither. Why?""
[Message 129] Liam: ""Just wondering if someone would want to get rid of him to influence the ruling. Gaining control of a valuable asset, you know?""
[Message 130] Asher: ""That's a big leap, Liam.""
[Message 131] Chloe: ""Yeah, that's some serious conspiracy stuff.""
[Message 132] Liam: ""I'm just thinking out loud! It's possible, right?""
[Message 133] Asher: ""Anything's possible, but it's highly unlikely.""
[Message 134] Chloe: ""Yeah, focus on reality.""
[Message 135] Liam: ""Okay, okay. I'll stop. Movie time.""
[Message 136] Asher: ""Good.""
[Message 137] Chloe: ""Thank goodness.""
[Message 138] Liam: ""Seriously though, this whole thing is messed up.""
[Message 139] Asher: ""Agreed.""
[Message 140] Chloe: ""Let's just try to enjoy the movie and forget about it for a few hours.""
[Message 141] Liam: ""Deal.""
[Message 142] Asher: ""Perfect.""
[Message 143] Chloe: ""Alright, see you guys soon!""
[Message 144] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 145] Asher: ""On my way!""
[Message 146] Liam: ""Heard they found the Hitting with a golf club used in the murder. Apparently, it was from the museum’s display.""
[Message 147] Asher: ""Damn, that's messed up. Someone really planned this out.""
[Message 148] Chloe: ""That's terrifying. How could someone do that?""
[Message 149] Liam: ""I don't know. But it's clear it wasn't just a random act.""
[Message 150] Asher: ""Definitely not. This is getting darker and darker.""
[Message 151] Chloe: ""I know, right? I'm starting to feel really uneasy.""
[Message 152] Liam: ""Me too. Makes you wonder what else is going to come out.""
[Message 153] Asher: ""Let's just hope they catch the person responsible soon.""
[Message 154] Chloe: ""Yeah, for real.""
[Message 155] Liam: ""Alright, let's try to put this aside and enjoy the movie. Easier said than done, I know.""
[Message 156] Asher: ""Agreed. A distraction is much needed.""
[Message 157] Chloe: ""Here's hoping it works.""
[Message 158] Liam: ""See you both in a bit.""
[Message 159] Asher: ""See ya!""
[Message 160] Chloe: ""Later!""
[Message 161] Liam: ""Hey, did either of you happen to see Asher leave the Museum that Early Afternoon?""
[Message 162] Chloe: ""No, I wasn't even there that day.""
[Message 163] Asher: ""What the hell, Liam? Why are you asking that?""
[Message 164] Liam: ""Just curious. No need to get defensive.""
[Message 165] Chloe: ""Yeah, Liam, that's a weird question. Asher was with me buying Hitting with a golf club and making dinner at my house that Early Afternoon.""
[Message 166] Asher: ""Seriously, Liam, what's your deal?""
[Message 167] Liam: ""Relax, guys. I was just trying to piece things together. Forget I said anything.""
[Message 168] Chloe: ""You're acting really strange, Liam.""
[Message 169] Asher: ""Yeah, it's not cool.""
[Message 170] Liam: ""Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop. Let's just watch the movie.""
[Message 171] Chloe: ""Good. Because this is getting out of hand.""
[Message 172] Asher: ""Yeah, let's drop it.""
[Message 173] Liam: ""Fine, dropped. See you soon.""
[Message 174] Chloe: ""Later.""
[Message 175] Asher: ""Later, man. But seriously, don't pull that again.""
[Message 176] Liam: ""I won't. I promise.""
[Message 177] Chloe: ""Good. Now, let's go watch this movie!""
[Message 178] Liam: ""Okay, here I come.""
[Message 179] Asher: ""Finally.""

[Message 4] LIAM: ""Dry Cleaner? What happened?""
[Message 5] FINN: ""Murder. Double homicide.""
[Message 6] LIAM: ""Seriously? That's insane. Who were the victims?""
[Message 7] CHLOE: ""I heard it was… um… Judge Thompson and this corrections officer, Dale.""
[Message 8] LIAM: ""Judge Thompson? Wow. He was always so nice to me. Always.""
[Message 9] FINN: ""He was kind, yeah. A little too trusting, maybe.""
[Message 10] CHLOE: ""What do you mean, Finn?""
[Message 11] FINN: ""Nothing, just saying. Some people are too nice for their own good. Anyway, I need to go to the store.""

[Message 16] CHLOE: ""Cool. So, this murder… any suspects?""
[Message 17] LIAM: ""I heard the cops are talking to everyone who was there that day.""
[Message 18] FINN: ""That's standard procedure. They have to. ""
[Message 19] CHLOE: ""True. I just hope they catch whoever did it. Dale didn't deserve that, nor did Judge Thompson.""
[Message 20] LIAM: ""Heard Dale was pretty stubborn. Didnt budge on issues even when he knew he was wrong.""
[Message 21] FINN: ""Stubborn how?""
[Message 22] LIAM: ""Just… you know. By the book. But that doesn't mean he deserved to die.""
[Message 23] CHLOE: ""Of course not. Nobody does. I'm just scared, that's all.""
[Message 24] FINN: ""Scared of what?""
[Message 25] CHLOE: ""That it could happen again. That someone we know could be… capable of something like that.""
[Message 26] LIAM: ""Don't think like that, Chloe. It'll drive you crazy. I was at the gym all day. ""
[Message 27] FINN: ""Yeah, Liam's right. Worrying won't help. I had to pick up some stuff for Mom. Headache stuff. ""
[Message 28] CHLOE: ""Okay, okay. Distract me. What's everyone doing this weekend?""
[Message 29] LIAM: ""Thinking of going camping. Need to clear my head.""
[Message 30] FINN: ""Camping? Sounds boring. I'm hitting up that new club downtown.""
[Message 31] CHLOE: ""A club? With all this going on? Brave.""
[Message 32] FINN: ""Life goes on, Chloe. Besides, gotta try and meet someone.""
[Message 33] LIAM: ""Good luck with that. I'll bring back some smores.""

[Message 42] CHLOE: ""Sounds good. We can order takeout. I want to learn how to play guitar""
[Message 43] LIAM: ""You and me both. Hey, did you ever talk to Dale much?""
[Message 44] CHLOE: ""Dale? Not really. He came in for dry cleaning sometimes, but we didn't chat. Why?""
[Message 45] LIAM: ""Just curious. He always seemed… on edge.""
[Message 46] CHLOE: ""Maybe he had a stressful job.""
[Message 47] LIAM: ""Yeah, maybe. Anyway, gotta pack. Talk later, Chloe.""

[Message 52] FINN: ""Something weird happened at the store today.""
[Message 53] CHLOE: ""What kind of weird?""
[Message 54] FINN: ""This guy was asking for some really specific Poisoning via ingestion. Like, knew exactly what he wanted.""
[Message 55] CHLOE: ""Okay… and?""
[Message 56] FINN: ""It was strange. Made me uncomfortable. He even had visible veins in hands""
[Message 57] CHLOE: ""Did you get a good look at him?""
[Message 58] FINN: ""Yeah, kinda. Mid-twenties, I think. Hunchback posture. Wore a hat.""
[Message 59] CHLOE: ""Hunchback posture? That's… distinctive.""
[Message 60] FINN: ""Tell me about it. I just thought it was weird timing, you know? With the murders and all.""
[Message 61] CHLOE: ""Definitely weird. Did you tell the police?""
[Message 62] FINN: ""I was going to, but then I thought maybe I was overreacting.""
[Message 63] CHLOE: ""Finn, you should tell them. It could be important. I think this guy intended to hurt Dale""

[Message 74] CHLOE: ""People are messed up, Liam. That's all there is to it.""
[Message 75] LIAM: ""Yeah, I guess. I keep thinking about the last time I saw him. He was talking about retiring soon.""
[Message 76] CHLOE: ""Retiring? Really?""
[Message 77] LIAM: ""Yeah. Said he wanted to travel the world. Guess that's not happening now. I intended to visit him again.""
[Message 78] CHLOE: ""That's so sad. Maybe you can still travel the world, Liam. In his memory.""
[Message 79] LIAM: ""Maybe. Right now, I just feel sick. Chloe, do you think this will be solved?""
[Message 80] CHLOE: ""I hope so, Liam. I really do. We have to trust the police.""

[Message 87] CHLOE: ""What now, Finn?""
[Message 88] FINN: ""I went to the police station this morning. Told them about the guy from the store.""
[Message 89] CHLOE: ""And?""
[Message 90] FINN: ""They said they already had someone in custody. Someone matching that description.""
[Message 91] CHLOE: ""Seriously? That was fast.""
[Message 92] FINN: ""Yeah, but get this… they said he was buying the Poisoning via ingestion for… his mom. For her garden.""
[Message 93] CHLOE: ""His mom? For her garden? Seriously? It might be an attempt to mislead authorities""
[Message 94] FINN: ""That's what they said. So, false alarm, I guess.""
[Message 95] CHLOE: ""I don't know, Finn. It still seems fishy. I would've said its causation for the murder""
[Message 96] FINN: ""Maybe. But the cops seemed pretty sure. Said he had an alibi for the time of the murders.""
[Message 97] CHLOE: ""An alibi? Damn. Okay, well, that's good, I guess. One less thing to worry about.""
[Message 98] FINN: ""Exactly. Anyway, I'm gonna go grab some lunch. You want anything?""
[Message 99] CHLOE: ""No, I'm good. Thanks. Let me know if you hear anything else.""

[Message 110] CHLOE: ""Okay, breathe. Did you call the police?""
[Message 111] LIAM: ""No! I panicked and left. I didn't want to get involved.""
[Message 112] CHLOE: ""Liam, you need to tell them this! It could be important!""

[Message 119] CHLOE: ""Yeah, he just told me. What did you hear?""
[Message 120] FINN: ""That he's telling the cops some crazy story about seeing someone near Judge Thompson's cabin.""
[Message 121] CHLOE: ""It's not crazy, Finn! He was genuinely scared!""
[Message 122] FINN: ""Maybe. Or maybe he's trying to throw suspicion off himself. He always hated Judge Thompson""
[Message 123] CHLOE: ""What? Why would he hate Judge Thompson?""
[Message 124] FINN: ""I don't know. Just a vibe I got. Plus, he was always sucking up to him. Seems sus""
[Message 125] CHLOE: ""Finn, that's ridiculous. Liam is just… upset. And scared.""
[Message 126] FINN: ""Whatever you say. I still think it's weird. Anyway, I'm going out for a bit. Need to clear my head.""
[Message 127] CHLOE: ""Be careful, Finn. And maybe don't spread rumors about Liam, okay?""
[Message 128] FINN: ""Fine, fine. See ya.""

[Message 130] CHLOE: ""What did they say? Did they believe you?""
[Message 131] LIAM: ""They said they'd look into it. But they seemed… skeptical.""
[Message 132] CHLOE: ""That's all they said? Did they ask you anything else?""
[Message 133] LIAM: ""Yeah, they asked me about my relationship with Judge Thompson. And about my alibi for the day of the murders.""
[Message 134] CHLOE: ""Alibi? Liam, are you a suspect?""
[Message 135] LIAM: ""I don't know, Chloe! I hope not! I was at the gym all day! I failed to call 911 after seeing the man, making it worse.""
[Message 136] CHLOE: ""Okay, okay, calm down. Just tell them the truth. They'll figure it out.""

[Message 30] Carol: Thankfully, yes!
[Message 31] River: Alright, alright, my turn. This is from years ago...
[Message 32] River: I was volunteering at a tech workshop for seniors...
[Message 33] River: ...and I accidentally showed everyone how to use the wrong filter on Snapchat, resulting in some very interesting selfies.
[Message 34] Alex: Oh my god, River! Which filter?
[Message 35] Jamie: This is amazing. I need details!
[Message 36] Carol: Snapchat filters for seniors! This is the best.
[Message 37] River: Let's just say there were a lot of seniors sporting puppy ears and flower crowns.
[Message 38] Alex: I am absolutely dying.
[Message 39] Jamie: I wish I'd seen that!
[Message 40] Carol: Digital literacy with a touch of digital chaos.
[Message 41] Alex: Okay, these are all fantastic. But let’s lighten the mood – anyone seen a funny meme lately?
[Message 42] Jamie: Always! There's this one with a cat judging a salad…
[Message 43] Carol: Send it over, Jamie! I need a good laugh.
[Message 44] River: I’m always down for cat memes.
[Message 45] Jamie: (Sends a meme of a cat looking disgusted at a bowl of salad)
[Message 46] Alex: Perfection!
[Message 47] Carol: That cat speaks to my soul.
[Message 48] River: Majestic disapproval.
[Message 49] Alex: On a completely different note, anyone have any camping trips planned for this year?
[Message 50] Jamie: I'm hoping to get out to Shenandoah in the fall. The colors are amazing.
[Message 51] Carol: Shenandoah is beautiful! I haven't been in ages.
[Message 52] River: I've been tinkering with the idea of getting a new tent. My old one is starting to leak.
[Message 53] Alex: Definitely invest in a good one! Makes all the difference.
[Message 54] Jamie: What kind are you looking at, River?
[Message 55] River: Thinking about a lightweight backpacking tent. Something easy to carry.
[Message 56] Carol: Remember to check the weatherproofing!
[Message 57] Alex: Good point, Carol. Learn from my soggy experiences.
[Message 58] Jamie: Haha! Story time, Alex?
[Message 59] Alex: Another time, Jamie! Another time. Let’s get back to volunteering humor. Anyone ever had a wardrobe malfunction while volunteering?
[Message 60] Carol: Oh lord, I hope not!
[Message 61] River: Now you're making me nervous. I always overdress for everything.
[Message 62] Jamie: I once ripped my pants while moving boxes at a food bank. Had to tie a sweatshirt around my waist.
[Message 63] Alex: That's resourceful!
[Message 64] Carol: You're a survivor, Jamie!
[Message 65] River: Always good to have a backup sweatshirt. Lesson learned.
[Message 66] Alex: I’m now picturing a whole series of “volunteering fail” memes.
[Message 67] Jamie: We should totally start a subreddit!
[Message 68] Carol: I'm in! ""r/VolunteerFails""
[Message 69] River: I'd subscribe.
[Message 70] Alex: Someone get on that!
[Message 71] Jamie: You got it! I’ll create it later.
[Message 72] Carol: Excellent! Now, back to the trail… feeling that Virginia Beach breeze.
[Message 73] River: The ocean air is doing wonders.
[Message 74] Alex: Agreed. So refreshing.
[Message 75] Jamie: I was listening to a podcast about the history of Virginia Beach on the way here. Pretty interesting!
[Message 76] Carol: Oh, what did you learn?
[Message 77] River: I love local history podcasts.
[Message 78] Jamie: Apparently, it used to be mostly farmland! Hard to imagine now.
[Message 79] Alex: Wow, that’s quite a change!
[Message 80] Carol: Things change fast, don’t they?
[Message 81] River: Speaking of fast, how’s everyone’s pace? We making good time?
[Message 82] Alex: I’m feeling good! Energized by the humor.
[Message 83] Jamie: I'm keeping up!
[Message 84] Carol: Steady and strong!
[Message 85] River: Excellent. Let's keep the good vibes going. Anyone got any jokes?
[Message 86] Alex: Why don't scientists trust atoms?
[Message 87] Jamie: Why?
[Message 88] Carol: Tell us!
[Message 89] River: I'm ready for it.
[Message 90] Alex: Because they make up everything!
[Message 91] Jamie: Haha! Classic.
[Message 92] Carol: You got me!
[Message 93] River: Solid dad joke.
[Message 94] Alex: I aim to please.
[Message 95] Jamie: My turn! What do you call a lazy kangaroo?
[Message 96] Carol: Hmmm… I’m drawing a blank.
[Message 97] River: I need a hint!
[Message 98] Alex: Is it something to do with being in a pouch?
[Message 99] Jamie: Pouch potato!
[Message 100] Carol: Oh my gosh, that's terrible! I love it.
[Message 101] River: Officially stealing that one.
[Message 102] Alex: Another winner! Alright, team, let's keep hiking! Maybe we'll find some more humor along the way.
[Message 103] Jamie: Sounds good! Onward and upward!
[Message 104] Carol: Let's do it!

[Message 3] Alex: ""Caleb? No way! I knew him. He was always so kind.""
[Message 4] Liam: ""I know, right? Makes you wonder who'd do something like that.""
[Message 5] Kai: ""Seriously. I was there earlier that day, taking photos. Makes you think.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Photos? You like photography?""
[Message 7] Kai: ""Sometimes. Mostly landscapes. Needed a new profile picture for my app. The Botanical Garden looked so pretty, but I'm not sure the cops believe it's for profile picture.""
[Message 8] Liam: ""You talked to the cops?""
[Message 9] Kai: ""Yeah, standard procedure, I guess. Being nearby and all.""
[Message 10] Alex: ""Right. Did they ask about anyone specific?""
[Message 11] Kai: ""Nah, just general questions about who I saw, if anything seemed off. I mentioned seeing someone arguing near the rose garden, but didn't recognize them.""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Rose garden, huh? Interesting.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Okay, this is getting weird. I’m going to make myself a coffee.""
[Message 14] Kai: ""Agreed. Need caffeine. This whole thing is unsettling.""
[Message 15] Liam: ""Okay, but back to the argument. Did it sound heated?""
[Message 16] Kai: ""Now that I think about it, yes, heated enough that I purposefully walked away. The guy's voice was familiar, but I can’t place it. It reminded me of Terry.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Terry? What's Terry got to do with this?""
[Message 18] Liam: ""Yeah, Alex is right. Terry barely knew Caleb.""
[Message 19] Kai: ""Maybe. Terry wasn’t a fan of Caleb's activist work. You know, all that protesting downtown. Called it a nuisance.""
[Message 20] Alex: ""Okay, that doesn't mean anything. Lots of people found the protests annoying.""
[Message 21] Liam: ""True. I mean, I secretly thought they blocked the traffic for way too long.""
[Message 22] Kai: ""The real problem is the death penalty. Do you think they'll push for it?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Hope not, but you never know with cases like this.""
[Message 24] Liam: ""Hey, anyone want to grab a pizza tonight? Need to get my mind off this.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""Pizza sounds good. I'm in. But I can only stay until 8:30. Got a thing.""

[Message 28] Kai: ""How about 7?""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Perfect. See you then. Alex, feel better!""
[Message 30] Alex: ""Thanks, Liam. You guys have fun.""
[Message 31] Liam: ""So, Kai, back to the Botanical Garden, did you see anyone else suspicious?""
[Message 32] Kai: ""Just an older lady feeding the birds. She looked harmless. But she mentioned needing Electrocution to deal with the rats in her garden.""
[Message 33] Liam: ""Hmm, odd coincidence. Electrocution again...""
[Message 34] Kai: ""Yeah, tell me about it. I even saw her looking at the manager earlier that day, like she wanted to say something.""
[Message 35] Liam: ""The manager? You think she did it? Maybe she purposefully didn't do anything when she found him?""
[Message 36] Kai: ""I'm not saying she did it, but it was definitely a weird vibe. And people say she hated him because he kept firing her relatives.""
[Message 37] Liam: ""Okay, that's a motive.""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Hey guys, sorry to interrupt. Just saw something online about the case. Apparently, the victim had a huge argument with someone named River the day before.""
[Message 39] Kai: ""River? I don't think I know River. Maybe River intended to hurt Caleb.""
[Message 40] Liam: ""River! River is obsessed with Kai. Maybe jealous of his photography. It can't be, right?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Obsessed? That's creepy. What's River like?""
[Message 42] Liam: ""Kind of intense. Always showing up where Kai is. Always staring. It's weird.""
[Message 43] Kai: ""It's true, she is a little intense. I try to avoid her. It's hard to get rid of her.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Maybe River did it out of jealousy, hoping to impress Kai? River always hated activist, if I recall.""
[Message 45] Liam: ""That would be messed up. Hope they find out the truth soon.""
[Message 46] Kai: ""Me too. I saw Terry leaving near the botanical garden at midnight. That's kind of weird too, right? Terry always knew I was there, at the Botanical Garden.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Midnight? What was Terry doing there at midnight? Did he always hate Caleb?""
[Message 48] Liam: ""Maybe he was looking for something? Seems sus.""
[Message 49] Kai: ""Yeah, seems suspicious. I should have called the cops.""
[Message 50] Alex: ""Did you see Terry near Caleb?""
[Message 51] Kai: ""Nah, just Terry by the entrance. I assumed Terry was leaving, like me. He always hated activist.""
[Message 52] Liam: ""Maybe Terry came back later?""
[Message 53] Alex: ""I need some fresh air. Going for a walk.""
[Message 54] Kai: ""Okay, Alex. Stay safe.""

[Message 57] Kai: ""Yep, see you soon.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Cool. So, River… You think she’s capable of something like this? Maybe her shouting provoked Terry. ""
[Message 59] Kai: ""I don't know, Liam. People are capable of anything. But Terry was talking about hurting Caleb right before he went over there.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Whoa, seriously? You heard him say that?""
[Message 61] Kai: ""Yeah, kind of brushed it off as just angry venting. Now I feel terrible.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""I think you should tell the police that. It could be important. They’re going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 63] Kai: ""I will. After pizza. I'm hungry and nervous.""
[Message 64] Alex: ""Guys, I'm back. And I just remembered something. A couple weeks ago, I overheard Terry on the phone, talking about “getting rid of” someone. I thought he was talking about his landlord.""
[Message 65] Liam: ""Whoa, Alex! That's huge! Getting rid of someone... that sounds intentional.""
[Message 66] Kai: ""He was looking up how to make Electrocution online, I'm pretty sure. Maybe that's the someone he was talking about.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""Seriously? Getting rid of the activists. Guys, this is too much.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""Yeah, this is getting really intense. I'm starting to feel uneasy.""
[Message 69] Kai: ""Me too. I need to think about this. I'm not sure I can do pizza anymore.""
[Message 70] Liam: ""What? You're backing out now? I made reservations.""
[Message 71] Kai: ""Sorry, Liam. I just need some space. I think I was aware of what was going on, but just didn't want to admit it.""
[Message 72] Alex: ""Maybe Terry's motivations aren't so obvious. Maybe it wasn't about the activism.""
[Message 73] Liam: ""What do you mean, Alex? You think it was personal?""
[Message 74] Alex: ""I don't know. Just a feeling. Something's not adding up.""
[Message 75] Kai: ""I'm going to call the police.""
[Message 76] Liam: ""Good. Do it. I'll go with you.""

[Message 13] Mark: Police got any leads?
[Message 14] Sarah: No clue. Just that it was Asphyxiation by strangulation.
[Message 15] David: That’s… brutal. I need a drink.
[Message 16] Sarah: After pizza, maybe?
[Message 17] David: Sounds like a plan. I need to take my mind off of this.
[Message 18] Mark: Agreed. Let’s just try and relax tonight.
[Message 19] Sarah: I saw Chandra near the dealership yesterday Afternoon. Anyone know why?
[Message 20] Mark: Chandra? No idea. She works downtown, right?
[Message 21] David: Yeah, she does. Maybe she was car shopping?
[Message 22] Sarah: Could be. Just seemed odd.
[Message 23] Mark: People go to car dealerships all the time, Sarah. Don’t overthink it.
[Message 24] Sarah: Okay, okay. Just saying.
[Message 25] David: Is it bad I'm relieved I don't know anyone involved?
[Message 26] Sarah: Not at all. It's normal to feel that way.
[Message 27] Mark: We all are, dude.
[Message 28] David: Guess so. Still messed up though.
[Message 29] Sarah: Totally.
[Message 30] Mark: So, pizza at 7?
[Message 31] Sarah: Yes, pizza at 7.
[Message 32] David: See you both then.
[Message 33] Sarah: Later.
[Message 34] Mark: Later.
[Message 35] Chandra: Hey Sarah, you free to chat?
[Message 36] Sarah: Hey Chandra. Yeah, what’s up?
[Message 37] Chandra: Just wanted to check in. You seemed a little off earlier.
[Message 38] Sarah: Just the news, you know? About 9.  Bartender
[Message 39] Chandra: Yeah, terrible. I heard they're going away for a long time for this. Scary.
[Message 40] Sarah: Super scary.
[Message 41] Chandra: Listen, about yesterday... I was getting my car serviced near the dealership.
[Message 42] Sarah: Oh, okay. Makes sense.
[Message 43] Chandra: Yeah, just didn’t want you to think anything weird.
[Message 44] Sarah: No worries.
[Message 45] Chandra: Did you see Leo around at all lately?
[Message 46] Sarah: Leo? Not recently. Why?
[Message 47] Chandra: Just haven’t heard from him in a while. He was always talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 48] Sarah: That's not a good look.
[Message 49] Chandra: Right? I'm a bit worried about him.
[Message 50] Sarah: Maybe you should check on him.
[Message 51] Chandra: Yeah, maybe. I'll think about it. Thanks, Sarah.
[Message 52] Sarah: Anytime.
[Message 53] Leo: Chandra, need to talk.
[Message 54] Chandra: What's up, Leo?
[Message 55] Leo: You didn't tell anyone about… you know… did you?
[Message 56] Chandra: About what, Leo? Be specific.
[Message 57] Leo: About me being at the dealership. About what I said.
[Message 58] Chandra: I might have mentioned you were hard up for cash.
[Message 59] Leo: Chandra! That's not helping!
[Message 60] Chandra: I didn't say anything else. Relax. Why? What did you do?
[Message 61] Leo: Nothing! Just… stressed.
[Message 62] Chandra: Stressed enough to… I don’t know… hurt someone?
[Message 63] Leo: No! Of course not! I’m not a monster.
[Message 64] Chandra: Then why are you acting so weird?
[Message 65] Leo: Because this whole thing is freaking me out, okay? Someone is dead.
[Message 66] Chandra: I know. But you need to calm down. Acting guilty makes you look guilty.
[Message 67] Leo: Easy for you to say. You weren't there.
[Message 68] Chandra: Where were you yesterday Afternoon?
[Message 69] Leo: I was… uh… at home.
[Message 70] Chandra: All Afternoon?
[Message 71] Leo: Mostly. I went out for a bit. To get groceries.
[Message 72] Chandra: Groceries? What did you buy?
[Message 73] Leo: Just… stuff. Milk, bread, you know.
[Message 74] Chandra: Did you buy Asphyxiation by strangulation at the store?
[Message 75] Leo: What? No! What the hell is wrong with you?
[Message 76] Chandra: Just trying to help you. But you're not making it easy.
[Message 77] Leo: I don't need your help. Just leave me alone.
[Message 78] Chandra: Fine. But if you're involved, you need to turn yourself in.
[Message 79] Leo: I said I wasn’t! God, just go away.
[Message 80] Chandra: Okay, okay. I'm going.
[Message 81] David: Hey Sarah, something's bugging me.
[Message 82] Sarah: What's up, David?
[Message 83] David: Remember how you saw Chandra near the dealership?
[Message 84] Sarah: Yeah?
[Message 85] David: Well, I saw Leo leaving the building at Afternoon.
[Message 86] Sarah: Leo? Seriously?
[Message 87] David: Yeah, I'm sure of it. He looked really agitated.
[Message 88] Sarah: That's… not good. Did you tell the police?
[Message 89] David: Not yet. I wanted to talk to you first.
[Message 90] Sarah: Maybe you should. This is important.
[Message 91] David: You think so? I don't want to get involved.
[Message 92] Sarah: You already are involved, David. You have information.
[Message 93] David: I know, I know. It's just… scary.
[Message 94] Sarah: I understand. But think about 9.  Bartender and his family.
[Message 95] David: Okay, you're right. I'll call them tomorrow.
[Message 96] Sarah: Good. Thanks, David.
[Message 97] David: No problem.
[Message 98] Mark: So, anyone hear anything new about the case?
[Message 99] Sarah: David saw Leo leaving the dealership at Afternoon.
[Message 100] Mark: Wow. Leo? That's surprising.
[Message 101] David: Yeah, I'm still processing it.
[Message 102] Mark: Did you tell the cops?
[Message 103] David: Planning to tomorrow.
[Message 104] Mark: Good. He always hated 9.  Bartender.
[Message 105] Sarah: Really? Why?
[Message 106] Mark: Some drama at the bar they both worked at. 9.  Bartender got him fired, I think.
[Message 107] Sarah: That's a motive, alright.
[Message 108] David: He was looking up how to make Asphyxiation by strangulation online.
[Message 109] Mark: Seriously? This keeps getting worse.
[Message 110] Sarah: Tell the police everything, David. Everything.
[Message 111] David: I will.
[Message 112] Mark: This could be it, guys. This could be the guy.
[Message 113] Sarah: Let's hope so. For 9.  Bartender's sake.
[Message 114] David: Agreed.
[Message 115] Chandra: Leo just called me. He's freaking out.
[Message 116] Sarah: What did he say?
[Message 117] Chandra: He thinks he's being framed. Says he was nowhere near the dealership.
[Message 118] Sarah: But David saw him.
[Message 119] Chandra: He said David is lying. Or mistaken.
[Message 120] Sarah: Hard to say. David seemed pretty sure.
[Message 121] Chandra: He says he was trying to find a car to start a rideshare thing.
[Message 122] Sarah: Rideshare? That's random.
[Message 123] Chandra: I know, right? It's all very strange.
[Message 124] Sarah: He's definitely hiding something.
[Message 125] Chandra: That's what I think.
[Message 126] Sarah: Did he say anything else incriminating?
[Message 127] Chandra: No, he clammed up. Just kept saying he's innocent.
[Message 128] Sarah: Innocent people don't act like that.
[Message 129] Chandra: Tell me about it.
[Message 130] David: I told the police everything. About Leo.
[Message 131] Sarah: Good. You did the right thing.
[Message 132] David: I hope so. I feel terrible.
[Message 133] Sarah: You shouldn't. You helped.
[Message 134] David: They asked me if I saw anyone else. I didn’t.
[Message 135] Sarah: Well, that's all you can do.
[Message 136] David: They said they are bringing him in for questioning.
[Message 137] Sarah: Hopefully, they'll get to the truth.
[Message 138] David: Yeah.
[Message 139] Mark: So, Leo's officially a suspect?
[Message 140] Sarah: Seems that way.
[Message 141] Mark: Good. Justice for 9.  Bartender.
[Message 142] Sarah: Agreed.
[Message 143] David: I hope they find out for sure.
[Message 144] Mark: They will. With David's help.
[Message 145] Sarah: Yeah, thanks, David.
[Message 146] David: Anytime.
[Message 147] Chandra: This is insane. They arrested Leo.
[Message 148] Sarah: I know. I saw.
[Message 149] Chandra: I feel awful.
[Message 150] Sarah: Why? You didn't do anything wrong.
[Message 151] Chandra: I just… I feel like I pushed him over the edge.
[Message 152] Sarah: You didn't. He made his own choices.
[Message 153] Chandra: Maybe.
[Message 154] Sarah: It's not your fault, Chandra. Remember that.
[Message 155] Chandra: Thanks, Sarah.
[Message 156] Sarah: Anytime.
[Message 157] Chandra: I gotta go.
[Message 158] Sarah: Okay. Take care.
[Message 159] Chandra: You too.
[Message 160] Mark: Police called me.
[Message 161] Sarah: What did they want?
[Message 162] Mark: Just asking about my relationship with 9.  Bartender and Leo.
[Message 163] Sarah: Did you tell them about the bar fight?
[Message 164] Mark: Yeah, everything.
[Message 165] Sarah: Good.
[Message 166] Mark: They asked if I knew anything about Asphyxiation by strangulation. Weird.
[Message 167] Sarah: Just covering all bases, I guess.
[Message 168] Mark: Yeah. Hope they nail Leo.
[Message 169] Sarah: Me too.
[Message 170] Mark: Anyway, wanna watch a movie tomorrow? Need to unwind.
[Message 171] Sarah: Sounds good.
[Message 172] Mark: Cool. Later.
[Message 173] Sarah: Later.
[Message 174] David: Cops just left.
[Message 175] Sarah: How did it go?
[Message 176] David: They wanted to know why I waited so long to come forward.
[Message 177] Sarah: What did you say?
[Message 178] David: I told them I was scared. Which is true.
[Message 179] Sarah: Good.
[Message 180] David: They seemed to buy it.
[Message 181] Sarah: I'm glad.
[Message 182] David: Still feels weird. I really didn't think much of it at the time.
[Message 183] Sarah: You did what you had to do.
[Message 184] David: Yeah.
[Message 185] Sarah: We all did.
[Message 186] David: This whole thing is so messed up.
[Message 187] Sarah: Tell me about it.
[Message 188] David: I need a long vacation.
[Message 189] Sarah: Me too.
[Message 190] David: Well, good night.",1,
370,"[Message 1] Agnes: Hey everyone, just got here to the car wash waiting area. Beautiful dusk tonight!
[Message 2] Alex: Hey Agnes! Me too. This is taking forever, though.
[Message 3] River: Hey both! Just pulled in. Anyone seen anything interesting lately? Art-wise, I mean.
[Message 4] Betty: Hello all! I'm here as well. River, actually, I saw a lovely watercolor exhibit downtown last week.
[Message 5] Agnes: Watercolor, huh? I always appreciate a good watercolor. So delicate.
[Message 6] Alex: Delicate isn't usually my thing. Give me something bold, like a good oil painting.
[Message 7] River: I'm with Alex! Love the texture of oils. Any particular artists you both admire?
[Message 8] Betty: I've always been partial to the Impressionists. Monet, Renoir... their use of light is just stunning.
[Message 9] Agnes: Oh yes, the Impressionists! Absolutely gorgeous. Monet's water lilies are breathtaking.
[Message 10] Alex: I'm more of a Van Gogh person. The Starry Night gets me every time.
[Message 11] River: Van Gogh is amazing! I actually tried to recreate The Starry Night once. Total disaster.
[Message 12] Betty: (laughing) Oh River, I know the feeling! I attempted a portrait once. Let's just say the resemblance was... abstract.
[Message 13] Agnes: We've all been there! It's the attempt that counts, right?
[Message 14] Alex: True. I'm more into appreciating art than creating it, though.
[Message 15] River: I enjoy both! Painting is a great stress reliever.
[Message 16] Betty: It is! Speaking of stress, I had a particularly trying teacher-student conference today.
[Message 17] Agnes: Oh dear, what happened, Betty?
[Message 18] Betty: Just the usual. Parents who think their child is a misunderstood genius.
[Message 19] Alex: Haha, sounds about right. I've heard those stories.
[Message 20] River: I can imagine! It's got to be tough dealing with that.
[Message 21] Agnes: It must be. Bless your heart, Betty.
[Message 22] Betty: Thank you, Agnes. Art helps me cope! Looking at beautiful things washes the day away.
[Message 23] Alex: Agreed. Sometimes you just need to escape into a good painting.
[Message 24] River: Totally. Are there any galleries in Worcester you all recommend? I'm looking for something new.
[Message 25] Agnes: The Worcester Art Museum is always a good starting point. They have a diverse collection.
[Message 26] Betty: Yes, the Worcester Art Museum is excellent. They also have rotating exhibits.
[Message 27] Alex: I haven't been there in ages. Maybe I should check it out again.
[Message 28] River: I'll definitely add it to my list. Thanks!
[Message 29] Agnes: You're welcome, River!
[Message 30] Betty: Anytime!
[Message 31] Alex: So, anyone got weekend plans? Besides admiring art, of course.
[Message 32] Agnes: I'm planning to visit my daughter. It's been too long.
[Message 33] Betty: That sounds lovely, Agnes!
[Message 34] River: Nice! I might try to finish that painting I started last week. Wish me luck.
[Message 35] Alex: Good luck! I'm going to try and tackle a home improvement project. Fixing a leaky faucet. Fun times.
[Message 36] Betty: Oh, I hate leaky faucets! Good luck with that, Alex.
[Message 37] Agnes: Leaky faucets are the worst. I hope it goes smoothly.
[Message 38] River: DIY projects are always an adventure.
[Message 39] Alex: Tell me about it. It'll probably end up being more complicated than I thought.
[Message 40] Betty: That's usually how it goes!
[Message 41] Agnes: Well, I'm sure you'll manage. You seem like a handy person, Alex.
[Message 42] Alex: I try to be! Anyway, back to art... Anyone into sculpture?
[Message 43] River: I appreciate sculpture, but I don't know much about it.
[Message 44] Betty: I find good sculpture fascinating. The way artists can transform a block of stone or metal is incredible.
[Message 45] Agnes: Absolutely! Michelangelo's David is just awe-inspiring.
[Message 46] Alex: Yeah, that's a classic. I'm more into modern sculpture, though. Something a bit more abstract.
[Message 47] River: Any modern sculptors you recommend?
[Message 48] Alex: There's this guy named Anish Kapoor... his work is pretty cool. Big, shiny, and thought-provoking.
[Message 49] Betty: I'll have to look him up. I'm always interested in learning about new artists.
[Message 50] Agnes: Me too! It's wonderful to expand your horizons.
[Message 51] River: Thanks for the recommendation, Alex!
[Message 52] Alex: No problem! Always happy to share my obscure art knowledge.
[Message 53] Betty: Obscure is good! The more obscure, the better, sometimes.
[Message 54] Agnes: So true! Sometimes the best art is hidden away.
[Message 55] River: Okay, my car is finally ready! Gotta run.
[Message 56] Alex: Mine too! What a coincidence.
[Message 57] Betty: Alright, drive safe everyone!
[Message 58] Agnes: Drive safely! It was lovely chatting with you all.
[Message 59] Alex: You too, Agnes, Betty, River! Maybe we can all check out that Worcester Art Museum sometime.
[Message 60] River: That sounds great, Alex!
[Message 61] Betty: I'd enjoy that very much.
[Message 62] Agnes: That would be delightful! Let's plan something soon.
[Message 63] Alex: Sounds like a plan! I'll get going then.
[Message 64] River: Bye all!
[Message 65] Betty: Goodbye!
[Message 66] Agnes: Farewell everyone! Have a wonderful evening.
[Message 67] Alex: You too, Agnes!
[Message 68] Betty: And you, Alex!
[Message 69] Alex: (after a few minutes) Still here. They gave my car to the wrong person.
[Message 70] Agnes: Oh no! That's terrible, Alex.
[Message 71] Betty: Oh my goodness! I hope they find it quickly.
[Message 72] Alex: They're looking into it now. It's a bit chaotic here.
[Message 73] Agnes: I can imagine! I'd be so frustrated.
[Message 74] Betty: Stay calm, Alex. Hopefully it's just a simple mistake.
[Message 75] Alex: Easier said than done! I had groceries in there.
[Message 76] Agnes: Oh dear! Melting ice cream, perhaps?
[Message 77] Betty: Oh no! That's even worse.
[Message 78] Alex: Possibly. I had a pint of Ben & Jerry's.
[Message 79] Agnes: Oh no, the horror!
[Message 80] Betty: My heart goes out to you, Alex. That's a tragedy.
[Message 81] Alex: Tell me about it. I was really looking forward to that.
[Message 82] Agnes: Hopefully they find your car and the ice cream is still salvageable.
[Message 83] Betty: Yes, fingers crossed!
[Message 84] Alex: Thanks, you two. I appreciate the sympathy.
[Message 85] Agnes: Of course! Anything we can do.
[Message 86] Betty: Absolutely. Let us know what happens.
[Message 87] Alex: Will do.
[Message 88] Agnes: In the meantime, maybe you can look at the art on their walls? A temporary distraction!
[Message 89] Betty: Good idea, Agnes! Try to find something calming.
[Message 90] Alex: They just have car-themed posters. Not exactly inspiring.
[Message 91] Agnes: Oh, that's disappointing.
[Message 92] Betty: Well, maybe close your eyes and imagine a beautiful painting.
[Message 93] Alex: I'm trying!
[Message 94] Agnes: Think of Monet's water lilies!
[Message 95] Betty: Or Van Gogh's Starry Night!
[Message 96] Alex: Okay, okay, I'm picturing it.
[Message 97] Agnes: Is it helping?
[Message 98] Betty: Are you feeling more serene?
[Message 99] Alex: A little bit, maybe. Mostly I'm still thinking about the melted ice cream.
[Message 100] Agnes: (laughing) Fair enough!
[Message 101] Betty: (laughing) I understand completely.
[Message 102] Alex: Okay, good news! They found the car. The ice cream is... mostly melted.
[Message 103] Agnes: Oh, that's such a relief!
[Message 104] Betty: Hooray!
[Message 105] Agnes: Mostly melted is better than completely melted!
[Message 106] Betty: Indeed!
[Message 107] Alex: True. I'll take what I can get.
[Message 108] Agnes: I'm so glad it worked out!
[Message 109] Betty: Me too!
[Message 110] Alex: Thanks for the support, you two! I really appreciate it.
[Message 111] Agnes: Anytime, Alex!
[Message 112] Betty: You're very welcome!
[Message 113] Alex: I'm finally heading out. Have a great night!
[Message 114] Agnes: You too, Alex! Enjoy the... somewhat melted ice cream!
[Message 115] Betty: Drive safely! And enjoy what's left of the Ben & Jerry's!",0,

[Message 6] Alex: ""I dabble in photo editing for my drawings. Snapseed is pretty good for quick adjustments.""
[Message 7] Sarah: ""I saw one that makes you look like a cartoon. Thinking of trying it on my cat.""
[Message 8] Jordan: ""Oh, Sarah, you have to! Post it, please!""
[Message 9] Liam: ""Speaking of posting, anyone ever feel pressured to make their life look more exciting online than it actually is?""
[Message 10] Alex: ""Definitely. It's curated reality, isn't it? Not always genuine.""
[Message 11] Sarah: ""I agree, Liam. It's exhausting trying to keep up with the Joneses online.""
[Message 12] Jordan: ""I try to keep it real. Just post pictures of my garden and my dog. Nothing too fancy.""
[Message 13] Liam: ""That sounds lovely, Jordan! A breath of fresh air in the digital world.""
[Message 14] Alex: ""My feed is mostly art and memes. Keeps it light.""
[Message 15] Sarah: ""Memes are life. They're how I communicate with my daughter half the time.""
[Message 16] Jordan: ""Haha, same! My grandkids send me the best ones.""
[Message 17] Liam: ""Anyone remember Vine? That was the OG short-form video platform.""
[Message 18] Alex: ""Oh man, Vine was iconic. I miss some of those creators.""
[Message 19] Sarah: ""Vine was before my time, I think. Or maybe I was just oblivious.""
[Message 20] Jordan: ""I was too busy trying to figure out Facebook back then!""
[Message 21] Liam: ""True! Facebook's still kicking, though. Used it to organize our camping trip last month, Jordan.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""That's right! Such a great time. We should do that again soon.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Camping sounds amazing. I've always wanted to try it.""
[Message 24] Sarah: ""Me too! I'm not very outdoorsy, but I'm willing to give it a shot.""
[Message 25] Liam: ""We should definitely plan something! Maybe in the fall?""
[Message 26] Jordan: ""I'm in! Count me in!""
[Message 27] Alex: ""I'd be interested. What kind of gear do you need?""
[Message 28] Sarah: ""I have absolutely zero gear. I'd need a full tutorial.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Don't worry, Sarah! We can help you get set up. It's all about layering!""
[Message 30] Jordan: ""And comfortable shoes! Can't stress that enough.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Good to know. I'll start researching tents.""
[Message 32] Sarah: ""Tents are essential. And bug spray. Lots and lots of bug spray.""
[Message 33] Liam: ""Yes! Bug spray is a must. Okay, back to social media… Anyone on that new Threads app?""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Tried it. Deleted it. Felt like Twitter, but less interesting.""
[Message 35] Sarah: ""Same here. I don't need another place to doomscroll.""
[Message 36] Jordan: ""I haven't even heard of it! I'm clearly behind the times.""
[Message 37] Liam: ""It's okay, Jordan! You're not missing much. Just another Zuckerberg creation.""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Speaking of Zuckerberg, anyone see that picture of him surfing?""
[Message 39] Sarah: ""Oh god, yes! The one with the sunscreen? Mortifying.""
[Message 40] Jordan: ""I haven't seen it. Should I Google it?""
[Message 41] Liam: ""I wouldn't recommend it. It's permanently burned into my brain.""
[Message 42] Alex: ""It's one of those things you can't unsee.""
[Message 43] Sarah: ""Agreed. Proceed with caution, Jordan.""
[Message 44] Jordan: ""Okay, okay! I'll take your word for it.""
[Message 45] Liam: ""Anyone have any good restaurant recommendations? I have a first date this weekend.""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Ooh, exciting! What kind of food does your date like?""
[Message 47] Sarah: ""Yes, details! We need details!""
[Message 48] Jordan: ""Somewhere with good ambiance is key for a first date.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""They said they're open to anything. I was thinking maybe Italian?""
[Message 50] Alex: ""There's a great Italian place downtown called Osteria Stella. A little pricey, but worth it.""
[Message 51] Sarah: ""I second Osteria Stella! The atmosphere is perfect.""
[Message 52] Jordan: ""And their pasta is amazing. Definitely a good choice, Liam.""
[Message 53] Liam: ""Okay, Osteria Stella it is! Thanks, everyone!""
[Message 54] Alex: ""Good luck on your date! Let us know how it goes.""
[Message 55] Sarah: ""Yes, spill the tea afterwards!""
[Message 56] Jordan: ""Have fun, Liam!""
[Message 57] Liam: ""Will do! Okay, back to social media… Anyone use LinkedIn?""
[Message 58] Alex: ""LinkedIn? Only when I'm job hunting. It's a necessary evil.""
[Message 59] Sarah: ""Same here. It's basically just a glorified online resume.""
[Message 60] Jordan: ""I use it to connect with former colleagues. It's good for networking.""
[Message 61] Liam: ""True. It can be useful. Anyone ever had a weird LinkedIn message?""
[Message 62] Alex: ""Oh god, so many. Random recruiters offering me jobs I'm completely unqualified for.""
[Message 63] Sarah: ""I got one from someone claiming to be a prince who needed my help to transfer money.""
[Message 64] Jordan: ""Oh my goodness! Be careful, Sarah!""
[Message 65] Liam: ""Definitely a scam, Sarah! Report that.""
[Message 66] Alex: ""Yeah, those are rampant on LinkedIn.""
[Message 67] Sarah: ""I know, I know. I reported it. It was just so ridiculous I had to share.""
[Message 68] Jordan: ""Good! Stay safe out there, everyone.""
[Message 69] Liam: ""Always! Anyone ever get catfished online?""
[Message 70] Alex: ""Thankfully, no. But I've heard some horror stories.""
[Message 71] Sarah: ""My cousin got catfished. It was a really bad situation.""
[Message 72] Jordan: ""Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's awful.""
[Message 73] Liam: ""It's so important to be careful online. Reverse image search is your friend.""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Definitely. And don't give out personal information to strangers.""
[Message 75] Sarah: ""And if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.""
[Message 76] Jordan: ""Wise words, everyone. Wise words.""
[Message 77] Liam: ""Okay, lighter topic! Anyone following any good YouTubers lately?""
[Message 78] Alex: ""I like watching art tutorials. There's this one called Proko that's really helpful.""
[Message 79] Sarah: ""I'm obsessed with beauty gurus. I love watching makeup tutorials.""
[Message 80] Jordan: ""I watch a lot of travel vlogs. Living vicariously through them.""
[Message 81] Liam: ""That sounds fun, Jordan! I should check some out. Anyone follow any true crime channels?""
[Message 82] Alex: ""I try to avoid true crime. It's a bit too dark for me.""
[Message 83] Sarah: ""Me too. I prefer lighter content.""
[Message 84] Jordan: ""I agree. I need something uplifting after a long day.""
[Message 85] Liam: ""Fair enough! Train's finally here! Everyone ready to go?""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Yep! Let's go.""
[Message 87] Sarah: ""Ready when you are!""
[Message 88] Jordan: ""Let's get on board!""
[Message 89] Liam: ""Okay, everyone on! This social media chat was fun. We should do it again sometime.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""Definitely! Maybe on the way back?""
[Message 91] Sarah: ""Sounds good to me!""
[Message 92] Jordan: ""Agreed. Safe travels, everyone!""
[Message 93] Liam: ""You too, Jordan! Catch you all later!""
[Message 94] Alex: ""Bye!""
[Message 95] Sarah: ""Bye everyone!""
[Message 96] Liam: ""(Later, on the train) Hey, anyone see that viral video of the dog riding a skateboard?""
[Message 97] Alex: ""Oh my god, yes! So cute!""
[Message 98] Sarah: ""Dogs are the best. I need to get a dog.""
[Message 99] Jordan: ""They truly are. Such loyal companions.""
[Message 100] Liam: ""They are! Speaking of animals, anyone on pet TikTok?""
[Message 101] Alex: ""Guilty! I follow a few accounts with cats doing silly things.""
[Message 102] Sarah: ""My daughter loves the ones with the talking dogs.""
[Message 103] Jordan: ""I'm not on TikTok, but I do enjoy watching animal videos on YouTube.""
[Message 104] Liam: ""They're the best! Okay, one last question… Anyone tried that AI art generator thing?""
[Message 105] Alex: ""I've been experimenting with it! It's pretty wild what it can create.""
[Message 106] Sarah: ""I tried it once. It gave me a picture of a purple elephant wearing a tutu.""
[Message 107] Jordan: ""Haha! That sounds amazing!""
[Message 108] Liam: ""It's crazy! The future is now. This is getting interesting""
[Message 109] Alex: ""definitely the future is now. It can only get interesting from here""
[Message 110] Sarah: ""I tried to create my own avatar and it did not resemble me at all""
[Message 111] Jordan: ""Oh mine resembled me a bit which was surprising""
[Message 112] Liam: ""Oh that's neat""
[Message 113] Alex: ""I guess the AI art generators are just getting started and can only go up""
[Message 114] Sarah: ""oh well I am glad it resembled you, perhaps I need to try some better generators""
[Message 115] Jordan: ""Yes there are plenty of good ones out there, worth a try""
[Message 116] Liam: ""Well, that's a great point""
[Message 117] Alex: ""True. I am looking forward to seeing what AI generators will do in future""
[Message 118] Sarah: ""Yeah like create a whole movie by itself or something?""
[Message 119] Jordan: ""Well that is a possibility, but it won't feel like a proper story I would imagine""
[Message 120] Liam: ""Oh right. I never thought about that perspective""
[Message 121] Alex: ""yeah well AI can't think like us yet""
[Message 122] Sarah: ""True. It will just be some computer code that does something""
[Message 123] Jordan: ""Yeah I doubt it will be able to truly understand the human condition""
[Message 124] Liam: ""Oh right. Let's see how this goes""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Right. Are there any other interesting apps that anyone has tried?""
[Message 126] Sarah: ""Well I am trying one that recommends which shoes to wear""
[Message 127] Jordan: ""haha that's funny""
[Message 128] Liam: ""Yeah that seems unnecessary haha""
[Message 129] Alex: ""It could be useful though haha""
[Message 130] Sarah: ""Yes for people like me who always have trouble deciding""
[Message 131] Jordan: ""oh well I think that is very useful""
[Message 132] Liam: ""Well what shoe did it recommend for today?""
[Message 133] Alex: ""That's a great question.""
[Message 134] Sarah: ""It recommended that I wear the sneakers, since I am doing a lot of walking.""
[Message 135] Jordan: ""Oh that's definitely a good choice. Always comfortable shoes!""
[Message 136] Liam: ""That seems like a perfect choice!""
[Message 137] Alex: ""Yes. Always good to choose comfort.""
[Message 138] Sarah: ""Definitely! What else should we talk about? Do you guys have a topic in mind""
[Message 139] Jordan: ""Well what social media trends have you guys noticed?""
[Message 140] Liam: ""Good question!""
[Message 141] Alex: ""Well I have noticed that these days short form content is really the king. Nobody likes to read a big long essay.""
[Message 142] Sarah: ""That's for sure!""
[Message 143] Jordan: ""Very true. I am also guilty of that!""
[Message 144] Liam: ""Totally! I am too!""
[Message 145] Alex: ""Yeah so nobody will write a long thing unless they are very passionate.""
[Message 146] Sarah: ""Yes exactly. People also tend to just watch the videos.""
[Message 147] Jordan: ""That's very true.""
[Message 148] Liam: ""Videos are definitely the go to choice""
[Message 149] Alex: ""Especially when its something visual like art.""
[Message 150] Sarah: ""Yep!""
[Message 151] Jordan: ""Right, anything else?""
[Message 152] Liam: ""Anyone like making reaction videos?""
[Message 153] Alex: ""That's a good point! Reaction videos are definitely in.""
[Message 154] Sarah: ""Yes I love watching those reaction videos!""
[Message 155] Jordan: ""oh you guys are into that?""
[Message 156] Liam: ""Definitely. It's a great way to see what other people think.""
[Message 157] Alex: ""Yes. Reaction videos let me see their reactions!""
[Message 158] Sarah: ""Haha you are so right!""
[Message 159] Jordan: ""Okay that makes sense! I have learnt a lot about it""
[Message 160] Liam: ""Great! Well we are at our stop now!""",0,

[Message 2] Jamie: ""Tell me about it, Alex. I've been here almost an hour already.""
[Message 3] River: ""I brought a book. Helps pass the time.""
[Message 4] Alex: ""Good idea, River. I should have thought of that. What are you reading?""
[Message 5] River: ""Just a biography of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Interesting woman.""
[Message 6] Jamie: ""Speaking of strong women, I need some advice. I'm trying to negotiate a new rate with a client, and they're lowballing me.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""That's tough, Jamie. What kind of work do you do?""
[Message 8] Jamie: ""I'm a nurse. Private care for elderly patients.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Ah, a fellow caregiver! I'm a physical therapist. My advice? Know your worth. Highlight your experience and the value you bring.""
[Message 10] River: ""Exactly. Don't be afraid to walk away. There are other clients out there who will appreciate your skills.""
[Message 11] Jamie: ""That's what I needed to hear. It's easy to get caught up in the pressure of needing the work.""
[Message 12] Alex: ""Remember, your time and expertise are valuable. Have you researched what other nurses in your area are charging?""
[Message 13] Jamie: ""I've done some digging online, but it's hard to find accurate numbers.""
[Message 14] River: ""Maybe network with other nurses. See if you can get some inside information. Professional organizations might have resources.""
[Message 15] Jamie: ""That's a great idea, River. I'll look into that. Thanks!""
[Message 16] Alex: ""No problem! Sometimes, it just helps to vent and get a fresh perspective.""
[Message 17] River: ""Indeed. By the way, Alex, you mentioned being a physical therapist. Have you seen much improvement with the new wearable tech people are using for rehab?""
[Message 18] Alex: ""Some, yes. It's not a magic bullet, but it can be a useful tool for tracking progress and motivating patients. Especially for younger folks.""
[Message 19] Jamie: ""Fascinating. Everything is becoming tech-driven, isn't it?""
[Message 20] Alex: ""It is. Keeps us on our toes! But good old-fashioned hands-on therapy still has its place.""
[Message 21] Jamie: ""Absolutely. Empathy and human connection are irreplaceable.""
[Message 22] River: ""Heard! What about you, River? What line of work are you in?""
[Message 23] River: ""I'm a mechanic. Not much tech involved there... mostly grease and elbow grease!""
[Message 24] Alex: ""Haha! I bet you see some interesting vehicles.""
[Message 25] River: ""Oh, you wouldn't believe it. Everything from vintage cars to beat-up trucks. Keeps life interesting.""
[Message 26] Jamie: ""My car's been making a funny noise lately. Maybe I should bring it to you sometime, River?""
[Message 27] River: ""Sure, Jamie. Stop by the shop anytime. We'll take a look.""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""Awesome, thanks! Back to the client thing, I think practicing my negotiation skills will help.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Role-playing can be helpful. Practice with a friend or family member.""
[Message 30] River: ""That's a good idea. Or even just writing down your key points can make you feel more confident.""
[Message 31] Jamie: ""I will definitely try that. This whole waiting room talk helped a lot, thanks you two.""
[Message 32] Alex: ""Anytime, Jamie! We're all in this together.""

[Message 2] Alex: ""Almost, Leo. Almost. Nothing beats Mom's lasagna.""
[Message 3] Leo: ""True, true. I still haven't figured out her secret ingredient.""
[Message 4] Alex: ""Probably just love, Leo. Cheesy, I know.""
[Message 5] Leo: ""Haha, maybe! Though, I bet it's a specific type of ricotta.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Could be. You planning on trying to replicate it soon?""
[Message 7] Leo: ""Thinking about it. Family dinner next month. Might be fun to surprise everyone.""
[Message 8] Alex: ""Go for it! I'll be your taste tester.""
[Message 9] Leo: ""Deal. Speaking of taste, this bread is surprisingly bland.""
[Message 10] Alex: ""Yeah, I noticed that too. Definitely not homemade.""
[Message 11] Leo: ""Right? Mom always made the best garlic bread. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.""
[Message 12] Alex: ""Oh man, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.""
[Message 13] Leo: ""Me too! Maybe we should call her later and ask for the recipe again.""
[Message 14] Alex: ""Worth a shot. She probably has it memorized by now anyway.""
[Message 15] Leo: ""Probably does. So, lasagna attempt aside, what are you thinking of cooking this week?""
[Message 16] Alex: ""I was thinking maybe a simple stir-fry. I found a new recipe online.""
[Message 17] Leo: ""Ooh, what kind?""
[Message 18] Alex: ""Chicken and broccoli with a sesame ginger sauce. Sounds pretty easy.""
[Message 19] Leo: ""That does sound good. I'm in the mood for something more… involved, I think.""
[Message 20] Alex: ""Like what? Elaborate soufflé? Five-course meal?""
[Message 21] Leo: ""Haha, no. Maybe just… a good pot roast. Haven't made one in ages.""
[Message 22] Alex: ""Pot roast is always a good choice. Comfort food at its finest.""
[Message 23] Leo: ""Exactly! And I can make mashed potatoes to go with it.""
[Message 24] Alex: ""Now you're talking! I'll bring the gravy.""
[Message 25] Leo: ""Perfect! It's a date, then. Pot roast night next week.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""Sounds like a plan. Hey, did you see that new exhibit at the art museum?""
[Message 27] Leo: ""No, I haven't. What's it about?""
[Message 28] Alex: ""Some modern artist. Lots of abstract stuff. I was thinking of checking it out.""
[Message 29] Leo: ""Might be interesting. I'm more of a classic art person myself.""
[Message 30] Alex: ""I know, I know. You and your Renaissance paintings.""
[Message 31] Leo: ""Hey, they're beautiful! Anyway, back to cooking… what kind of sesame oil are you using in your stir-fry?""
[Message 32] Alex: ""Good question. I think I have both toasted and regular. Probably toasted for more flavor?""
[Message 33] Leo: ""Definitely toasted. Makes a huge difference.""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Alright, noted! Thanks for the tip, Chef Leo.""
[Message 35] Leo: ""Anytime! I'm practically a professional at this point.""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Ha! Don't let it go to your head. So, you said pot roast, what cut of beef are you thinking?""
[Message 37] Leo: ""Chuck roast, usually. It gets nice and tender when slow-cooked.""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Good choice. I always struggle to pick the right cut.""
[Message 39] Leo: ""Just ask the butcher! They usually know their stuff.""
[Message 40] Alex: ""True, true. I always feel like I'm bothering them though.""
[Message 41] Leo: ""Nonsense! They're there to help. Plus, they probably appreciate someone who actually cares about the meat they're buying.""
[Message 42] Alex: ""That's a good point. Maybe I'll be brave this time.""
[Message 43] Leo: ""Do it! You can conquer the butcher counter.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Haha, one small step for Alex, one giant leap for cooking-kind.""
[Message 45] Leo: ""Exactly! Okay, enough about butcher shops. Dessert?""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Is there even room? I'm stuffed.""
[Message 47] Leo: ""There's always room for dessert. It's a separate stomach.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""You're incorrigible. Fine, what are we getting?""
[Message 49] Leo: ""I'm eyeing that chocolate cake. Looks pretty decadent.""
[Message 50] Alex: ""Alright, chocolate cake it is. We can split it.""
[Message 51] Leo: ""Sounds good. You know, Mom also makes a killer chocolate cake...""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Don't even start! You'll have me calling her for another recipe before we're even done eating this cake.""
[Message 53] Leo: ""Maybe… maybe not. But you have to admit, she's a culinary genius.""

[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, I saw it on the news. Awful. Anyone know what happened?

[Message 3] Noah: Stabbing at Temple, that's all they said. Brutal.

[Message 4] Chloe: I was near Temple this morning! Around Late Morning actually. Getting coffee at that new place.

[Message 5] Daniel: Late Morning? That's when it happened, right?

[Message 6] Chloe: Yeah, something like that. I didn't see anything though. Just grabbed my latte and left.

[Message 7] Liam: Maybe it's related to the case Judge Thompson was working on? The Peterson trial?

[Message 8] Maya: Maybe. She was a tough judge. Didn't seem to make many friends.

[Message 9] Noah: I heard she fired some employees a while back. That could do it.

[Message 10] Daniel: Yeah i heard she got rid of someone. Judge Thompson intended to fire them because they were too annoying.

[Message 11] Chloe: I need a new phone case, anyone know good place?

[Message 12] Liam: Seriously, Chloe? Now's not the time to talk about phone cases.

[Message 13] Chloe: Sorry, just trying to lighten the mood. This is all so depressing.

[Message 14] Maya: Has anyone spoken to Alex recently? He seemed pretty upset about something last week.

[Message 15] Noah: Alex? I haven't seen him in ages. Why Alex?

[Message 16] Maya: Just a feeling. He was muttering about ""getting even"" last week. Though it was about parking tickets, prob nothing.

[Message 17] Liam: Let's not start pointing fingers. We should let the police investigate.

[Message 18] Daniel: I agree with Liam, but to be fair, I heard Judge Thompson had a run-in with Alex sometime ago.

[Message 19] Chloe: Wait, Alex? The one with the missing pinky finger?

[Message 20] Noah: Yeah, that's him. What about it, Chloe?

[Message 21] Chloe: Nothing, just… I saw him near Temple yesterday. Seemed agitated.

[Message 22] Liam: Yesterday? Before the murder?

[Message 23] Chloe: Yeah. I didn't think much of it at the time.

[Message 24] Daniel: Judge Thompson probably knew Alex was there yesterday. I think she was aware about it.

[Message 25] Maya: Did Alex say anything to you, Chloe? Anything at all?

[Message 26] Chloe: No, he just walked past. But he was carrying something… like a small tool bag? I don't know.

[Message 27] Noah: A tool bag? Like he was going to fix something?

[Message 28] Daniel: Guys, seriously, can we not jump to conclusions?

[Message 29] Liam: I'm just worried about what Alex did. Judge Thompson was really nice.

[Message 30] Maya: I hope whoever did this gets what they deserve. They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 31] Chloe: I saw Alex buying something weird at the hardware store last week, like a pointy ice thing? Maybe an ice pick?

[Message 32] Noah: An ice pick? That's… specific.

[Message 33] Liam: Now that you mention it, I saw Alex looking up ice picks online a few days ago. He was gonna buy it!

[Message 34] Daniel: Ok, this is getting ridiculous. You guys are gonna get Alex in trouble for nothing.

[Message 2] Mark: ""Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. What's going on?""

[Message 4] Mark: ""Frank... I think I knew him. He was a journalist, right? Seemed like a nice guy.""
[Message 5] Sarah: ""Yeah, that's him. And George, the security guard. Awful stuff.""
[Message 6] Mark: ""Did they say how it happened?""
[Message 7] Sarah: ""Arson by setting a fire. The news said it was Early Evening. Makes you wonder about their mental state.""
[Message 8] Mark: ""Arson by setting a fire? That's insane! Any suspects?""

[Message 10] Mark: ""Benny? The guy with the underbite? Why him?""
[Message 11] Sarah: ""I don't know, just a rumor. Supposedly he hated Frank. Maybe jealousy, some said Frank was successful.""
[Message 12] Mark: ""Wow. I mean, Benny always seemed a bit off, but murder? That's intense.""
[Message 13] Sarah: ""Exactly. Also heard they questioned Tracy. She always wears glasses.""
[Message 14] Mark: ""Tracy? I thought she was friends with everyone.""
[Message 15] Sarah: ""That's what I thought too. Maybe she was there when it happened and just didn't help? Like a failure to call 911. Maybe she was scared?""

[Message 21] Sarah: ""That's who they're calling crazy Kevin with the wrinkled forehead? I heard they picked him up too. Said he was mumbling about voices in his head.""
[Message 22] Mark: ""Seriously? That's messed up. Maybe he actually did it, if he wasn't in his right mind...""
[Message 23] Sarah: ""Maybe. Or maybe he's just an easy scapegoat. So, are you going to the memorial?""

[Message 34] Mark: ""Exactly! Maybe that was enough to push him over the edge. And the timing... He was seen leaving the building at Early Evening.""
[Message 35] Sarah: ""Wow, you're right. I didn't think about that.""
[Message 36] Mark: ""Just putting the pieces together. What about Tracy? Any ideas about her motives?""
[Message 37] Sarah: ""I have no clue. Maybe something related to George? Maybe they were fighting?""
[Message 38] Mark: ""Possible. Maybe George knew something about Tracy, and she wanted to get rid of him?""
[Message 39] Sarah: ""That's a dark thought. Hope it's not true.""
[Message 40] Mark: ""Me too. This whole thing is making me paranoid.""
[Message 41] Sarah: ""I know. I keep thinking about if I knew them better, could I have prevented it?""
[Message 42] Mark: ""Don't beat yourself up about it. There's no way you could have known.""
[Message 43] Sarah: ""Easier said than done. Hey, did you hear about the fire at the old warehouse last month?""
[Message 44] Mark: ""Yeah, what about it?""
[Message 45] Sarah: ""Some people are saying Kevin was seen near the warehouse before it went up in flames.""
[Message 46] Mark: ""Okay, now that's suspicious. Maybe it's his thing... starting fires. A mental illness induced delusion could lead to something like this.""
[Message 47] Sarah: ""That's what I'm saying! It all adds up, doesn't it?""
[Message 48] Mark: ""It does. But we shouldn't jump to conclusions.""
[Message 49] Sarah: ""True. But still... I'm leaning towards Kevin or Benny being involved.""
[Message 50] Mark: ""Me too. Alex seems less likely, but you never know.""
[Message 51] Sarah: ""Exactly. By the way, did you watch that new show everyone's talking about?""
[Message 52] Mark: ""No, I haven't. Is it any good?""
[Message 53] Sarah: ""It's amazing! You should definitely check it out. We can watch it sometime.""
[Message 54] Mark: ""Sounds good. Maybe next week?""
[Message 55] Sarah: ""Perfect. Back to the case though, it sounds as if someone was buying Arson by setting a fire at the store close by.""
[Message 56] Mark: ""That does not sound good at all.""
[Message 57] Sarah: ""It really doesn't.""
[Message 58] Mark: ""Do you think this was the first time something like this has happened?""
[Message 59] Sarah: ""Definitely not. They were definitely aware that this was going to happen.""
[Message 60] Mark: ""That just sounds like this was intended all along.""
[Message 61] Sarah: ""It was.""
[Message 62] Mark: ""This all falls on who started it.""
[Message 63] Sarah: ""Yeah. Their shouting probably provoked him.""
[Message 64] Mark: ""Maybe so, but who knows what he knew.""
[Message 65] Sarah: ""This might be more than he thought.""
[Message 66] Mark: ""Maybe so. Hey did you do that assignment for work?""
[Message 67] Sarah: ""Yeah, I'm waiting to hear back about that, you know?""
[Message 68] Mark: ""Did you ever end up getting tickets for the concert?""
[Message 69] Sarah: ""No, I didn't. I wanted to, but they sold out.""
[Message 70] Mark: ""That's alright. I heard it wasn't all that great anyways.""
[Message 71] Sarah: ""Oh really? That sucks.""
[Message 72] Mark: ""Yeah. Well, hopefully the play is going to be better.""
[Message 73] Sarah: ""Me too. I'm excited to see it.""
[Message 74] Mark: ""Yeah, it's been a while since we've seen a play.""
[Message 75] Sarah: ""I know. We should go more often.""
[Message 76] Mark: ""For sure. What do you think about the new restaurant?""
[Message 77] Sarah: ""I think it's pretty good. The food is nice, the prices are too.""
[Message 78] Mark: ""That's good to hear. We should go there sometime.""
[Message 79] Sarah: ""We should. I'm down.""
[Message 80] Mark: ""Sweet.""
[Message 81] Sarah: ""But seriously though, that place had a nice atmosphere.""
[Message 82] Mark: ""Maybe we should go with a group of friends.""
[Message 83] Sarah: ""Yeah, we should.""
[Message 84] Mark: ""I'm down to set that up.""
[Message 85] Sarah: ""Awesome. Anyways, I'm hungry.""
[Message 86] Mark: ""Me too. Wanna grab something to eat?""
[Message 87] Sarah: ""For sure. Where should we go?""
[Message 88] Mark: ""I'm not sure, whatever you want.""
[Message 89] Sarah: ""What about that place with the long lines?""
[Message 90] Mark: ""Yeah that place is awesome.""
[Message 91] Sarah: ""Okay, let's go then.""
[Message 92] Mark: ""Sounds good. Let me go grab my keys.""
[Message 93] Sarah: ""For sure, just give me a second to grab my purse.""
[Message 94] Mark: ""Okay, let me know when you're ready.""
[Message 95] Sarah: ""Alright, let's go.""
[Message 96] Mark: ""I'm surprised Alex didn't try to sell them drugs, haha.""
[Message 97] Sarah: ""You're so bad, haha.""
[Message 98] Mark: ""Yeah, but it's true.""
[Message 99] Sarah: ""I know, but still.""
[Message 100] Mark: ""Anyways, that's it for that convo.""
[Message 101] Sarah: ""Yeah, I know right, like let's just stop.""
[Message 102] Mark: ""Sounds good. I need to go.""
[Message 103] Sarah: ""Yeah, that's fine.""
[Message 104] Mark: ""Alright, let me just grab my things.""

[Message 4] Zara: ""It's awful. My thoughts are with their families. What a tragedy.""
[Message 5] Nico: ""Tragic, definitely. Heard it was a Car accident (vehicular homicide). Scary stuff.""
[Message 6] Liam: ""Car accident (vehicular homicide)? Damn. Wonder what happened.""
[Message 7] Kai: ""Maybe someone wasn't paying attention. People are always on their phones.""
[Message 8] Zara: ""True. Distracted driving is a huge problem. I saw a billboard about it today near Main Street.""
[Message 9] Nico: ""Or maybe they were reckless. Some people drive like maniacs around here.""

[Message 30] Liam: ""A Judge? That's heavy. Hope they catch whoever did it.""
[Message 31] Kai: ""Yeah, hope they get what they deserve. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 32] Zara: ""I agree. It's important that justice is served.""
[Message 33] Nico: ""Absolutely. There's no excuse for that kind of violence.""
[Message 34] Liam: ""Hey Kai, you know anything about cars? Mine's been making a weird noise.""
[Message 35] Kai: ""A little. What kind of noise?""
[Message 36] Liam: ""Like a scraping sound, mostly when I turn.""
[Message 37] Kai: ""Could be your brakes. Or maybe something stuck in the wheel well.""
[Message 38] Liam: ""I'll check it out tomorrow. Thanks!""

[Message 51] Liam: ""True. I know he always hated 7.  Activist.""
[Message 52] Nico: ""He mentioned something about her being unfair to him once.""

[Message 81] Liam: ""Yeah, probably. Smart move.""
[Message 82] Zara: ""I guess. I just hope they find the people responsible and bring them to justice.""
[Message 83] Kai: ""Me too. What they did to the Judge and 7.  Activist was terrible.""

[Message 6] Liam: ""That's what I heard on the street, Maya. Maybe just a rumor.""

[Message 12] Noah: ""Chad? Weird. He always struck me as…intense. Probably just stressed about work.""
[Message 13] Liam: ""Chad’s got a loud voice, huh? You could hear him from a mile away. I heard he knew Alex.""
[Message 14] Maya: ""Knew Alex? How?""
[Message 15] Liam: ""Don’t know, just something I overheard.""
[Message 16] Noah: ""Speaking of knowing people, didn't Sarah (Suspect 3) used to be obsessed with Alex?""

[Message 18] Liam: ""I don't think she'd actually do anything…would she?""

[Message 20] Maya: ""Yeah, but he seemed really broken up about it at the picnic after it happened.""
[Message 21] Liam: ""He said he had to. Business is business, right? Still…two people are dead. It’s probably that weirdo Carl did it.""
[Message 22] Maya: ""Who's Carl?""

[Message 35] Maya: ""I guess so. It's just…the way she said it. Like she *intended* it to happen.""
[Message 36] Noah: ""Well, don't go jumping to conclusions. Remember what happened last time you thought someone was guilty? It was a total mess.""
[Message 37] Maya: ""True, true. Still...this feels different. This time it seems like Sarah's shouting probably provoked someone to do it, since I saw her near Park.""

[Message 109] Chloe: ""She was buying Falling object (dropped from height) at the store""
[Message 110] Chloe: ""I heard that the judge ruled against a major developer last week""
[Message 111] Ava: ""That would make sense, but she tried to talk him out of it""
[Message 112] Chloe: ""That's right. That developer was furious.""
[Message 113] Ava: ""I heard someone saw her buying Falling object (dropped from height) objects at the hardware store.""
[Message 114] Chloe: ""I thought Rick’s ex-wife was acting weird that night.""
[Message 115] Ava: ""Yes I know she intended to hurt him.""
[Message 116] Chloe: ""I knew the seriousness of not calling 911 after the victims were hurt, making the harm worse.""
[Message 117] Ava: ""I’m aware that if the victims hadn’t failed to call 911 none of this would have happened""
[Message 118] Chloe: ""I purposefully avoided going near the scene""
[Message 119] Ava: ""If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened""

382,"[Message 1] CHLOE: Hey Liam, you okay? Heard about what happened at Town Hall.

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, Chloe, it’s messed up. I knew both Kai and Jordan. Especially Jordan, we worked together.

[Message 3] CHLOE: I can't believe that 9.  Bartender is gone. Poor Kai

[Message 4] LIAM: Right?

[Message 5] ASH: Guys, this is awful. I saw Amelia near Town Hall Dead of Night.

[Message 6] CHLOE: Amelia? Really? What was she doing?

[Message 7] LIAM: Ash, are you sure? Did you actually see her?

[Message 8] ASH: Positive. Around 1 AM. Seemed like she was arguing with someone.

[Message 9] CHLOE: Arguing? About what? This is getting weirder. You know Amelia got fired from town hall?

[Message 10] LIAM: Fired? When? Why? I didn't know that.

[Message 11] ASH: Few weeks ago, apparently. Something about her performance. Jordan was the one who signed off on it, I think.

[Message 12] CHLOE: This is insane. Did she knew about Jordan?

[Message 13] LIAM: Probably. Everyone knew each other.

[Message 14] ASH: Anyone hear from Ben? He was always complaining about Kai being too loud during his shifts.

[Message 15] CHLOE: Ben? Nah. He's probably just holed up somewhere playing video games. He always hated 9.  Bartender though.

[Message 16] LIAM: Yeah, Ben's a bit of a loner. Wonder if the cops have talked to him.

[Message 17] ASH: They must have. Liam, you working today?

[Message 18] LIAM: No, thankfully. Took the day off. Needed it.

[Message 19] CHLOE: I'm going to need a drink later. You in?

[Message 20] LIAM: Definitely.

[Message 21] ASH: Count me in too.

[Message 22] CHLOE: Okay, good. I'm so shaken up from this.

[Message 23] LIAM: Me too. Thinking of Jordan’s family. This is messed up.

[Message 24] ASH: Okay, I’m heading to work. Catch you guys later.

[Message 25] CHLOE: Later, Ash. Stay safe.

[Message 26] LIAM: Later.

[Message 27] CHLOE: Liam, between us, do you think Amelia could've done it?

[Message 28] LIAM: Chloe, I don’t know. It's hard to believe, but that argument Ash mentioned... and her getting fired...

[Message 29] CHLOE: Yeah, it's suspicious. But Pushing from a height seems so… premeditated.

[Message 30] LIAM: Exactly.

[Message 31] CHLOE: I saw Amelia buying Pushing from a height at the store.

[Message 32] LIAM: I feel bad pointing fingers without any proof.

[Message 33] CHLOE: I do too, but we need to think about who would’ve wanted them dead.

[Message 34] LIAM: True. Maybe Ben had a breaking point with Kai?

[Message 35] CHLOE: Maybe. But Ben doesn’t strike me as someone who would plan something like that.

[Message 36] LIAM: Me neither. He’s more of a complain-about-it type.

[Message 37] CHLOE: Remember how furious Ben was when Kai shorted him a drink?

[Message 38] LIAM: Vaguely. Everyone gets mad about short drinks. It's not a motive for murder.

[Message 39] CHLOE: True. Just trying to think of anything.

[Message 40] LIAM: Me too. This is going to be all over the news for weeks.

[Message 41] CHLOE: The media is going to eat this up.

[Message 42] LIAM: Definitely.

[Message 43] ASH: Hey, guys. Work was crazy. Everyone's talking about it.

[Message 44] CHLOE: I can imagine.

[Message 45] LIAM: Yeah, it must be.

[Message 46] ASH: Heard the cops are looking into everyone who had any kind of beef with Jordan or Kai.

[Message 47] CHLOE: That’s everyone at Town Hall, then.

[Message 48] LIAM: Almost. This is insane.

[Message 49] ASH: So, about tonight, same place as always?

[Message 50] CHLOE: Yeah, sounds good. I need a strong one. Or five.

[Message 51] LIAM: Make that six for me.

[Message 52] ASH: Haha, alright. See you both later.

[Message 53] CHLOE: Later.

[Message 54] LIAM: Later.

[Message 55] CHLOE: Liam, you think they’ll ever catch whoever did this?

[Message 56] LIAM: I hope so, Chloe. For Jordan and Kai's families. And for our peace of mind.

[Message 57] CHLOE: Me too. It's terrifying to think someone we know is capable of something like this.

[Message 58] LIAM: Exactly. It’s like something out of a movie.

[Message 59] CHLOE: A horror movie.

[Message 60] LIAM: Definitely.

[Message 61] ASH: Hey, you guys still on for tonight? Just checking.

[Message 62] CHLOE: Yeah, definitely. Need to vent.

[Message 63] LIAM: Still in.

[Message 64] ASH: Cool. See you both soon.

[Message 65] CHLOE: See ya.

[Message 66] LIAM: Later.

[Message 67] CHLOE: Liam, something's bugging me.

[Message 68] LIAM: What's that?

[Message 69] CHLOE: When Ash said she saw Amelia arguing, she didn't say who Amelia was arguing *with*.

[Message 70] LIAM: True. She was buying Pushing from a height at the store. Could be no one, though.

[Message 71] CHLOE: I know, but… what if it was Jordan? Or Kai?

[Message 72] LIAM: Maybe. We're reaching, Chloe.

[Message 73] CHLOE: I know, I know. Just thinking out loud. This whole thing feels… off.

[Message 74] LIAM: Agreed.

[Message 75] ASH: Hey, running a bit late. See you both in like 20?

[Message 76] CHLOE: No worries.

[Message 77] LIAM: Cool.

[Message 78] CHLOE: Liam, did you notice how quickly Ash changed the subject earlier, when we were talking about Amelia?

[Message 79] LIAM: I did notice that, yeah. What do you think it means?

[Message 80] CHLOE: I don't know. Maybe she knows more than she's letting on. Or maybe she's just uncomfortable talking about it.

[Message 81] LIAM: Could be either. This whole thing is making me paranoid.

[Message 82] CHLOE: Same here. I keep replaying everything in my head, trying to find some clue we missed.

[Message 83] LIAM: Me too. It's exhausting.

[Message 84] CHLOE: Yeah. Maybe a drink will help us relax.

[Message 85] LIAM: Hopefully.

[Message 86] ASH: Hey, I'm here. Where are you guys sitting?

[Message 87] CHLOE: We're at the usual table, near the back.

[Message 88] LIAM: Yeah, back corner.

[Message 89] ASH: Okay, be right there.

[Message 90] CHLOE: Liam, I have a bad feeling about this.

[Message 91] LIAM: About what? Ash?

[Message 92] CHLOE: Yeah. Something's just not adding up. He said she wanted to get rid of him.

[Message 93] LIAM: Okay, let's just try to stay calm and observe. Don't say anything accusatory.

[Message 94] CHLOE: Agreed.

[Message 95] ASH: Sorry I’m late. Traffic was awful.

[Message 96] CHLOE: No problem.

[Message 97] LIAM: All good. What will you have?

[Message 98] ASH: Just a beer for now. Thanks.

[Message 99] CHLOE: So, Ash, about what you saw Dead of Night…

[Message 100] LIAM: Chloe, maybe we should just drop it.

[Message 101] ASH: What about it?

[Message 102] CHLOE: Just wondering if you remembered anything else. Any details.

[Message 103] ASH: Not really. It was dark. I just saw Amelia yelling. I didn't hear what she was saying.

[Message 104] LIAM: It's okay, Ash. We’re just trying to figure things out.

[Message 105] CHLOE: Yeah, no pressure.

[Message 106] ASH: It’s fine. Just… stressful, you know? Hope they don't get the death penalty.

[Message 107] LIAM: Yeah. Stressful for everyone.

[Message 108] CHLOE: Definitely.

[Message 109] ASH: You guys think they’ll find the person who did this soon?

[Message 110] CHLOE: I hope so. The sooner, the better.

[Message 111] LIAM: Me too.

[Message 112] ASH: Well, I’m gonna head home. This beer is making me sleepy.

[Message 113] CHLOE: Alright. Get home safe.

[Message 114] LIAM: Yeah, be careful.

[Message 115] ASH: Will do. Later.

[Message 116] CHLOE: Later.

[Message 117] LIAM: Bye.

[Message 118] CHLOE: Liam, I am so convinced Ash is hiding something.

[Message 119] LIAM: I know. But what could it be?

[Message 120] CHLOE: Maybe… maybe she was there too. Maybe she saw more than she's letting on because she was involved somehow. She was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.

[Message 121] LIAM: Whoa, Chloe. Slow down. That’s a big leap.

[Message 122] CHLOE: I know, but think about it! She changed the subject, she was vague about the argument, and she seemed really eager to leave tonight.

[Message 123] LIAM: It's possible. But maybe she's just freaked out. This is a huge deal.

[Message 124] CHLOE: Maybe. But I don't trust her.

[Message 125] LIAM: Okay, what do we do?

[Message 126] CHLOE: I don't know. But I think we need to be careful around her.

[Message 127] LIAM: Agreed. Let's just keep our eyes open.

[Message 128] CHLOE: Okay. I'm going home too. This night has been too much.

[Message 129] LIAM: Me too. Get home safe.

[Message 130] CHLOE: You too.

[Message 131] LIAM: Night.

[Message 132] CHLOE: Night.

[Message 133] LIAM: I just remembered something. Ash knew about Ben's dislike for Kai.

[Message 134] CHLOE: Oh god. He was looking up how to make Pushing from a height online.

[Message 135] LIAM: Yeah. I'm starting to think you might be right about Ash.

[Message 136] CHLOE: Okay, Liam, we need to go to the police.

[Message 137] LIAM: I think you're right.

[Message 138] CHLOE: First thing in the morning.

[Message 139] LIAM: Agreed. Let's try to get some sleep. We're going to need it.

[Message 140] CHLOE: Okay. Goodnight, Liam. Be safe.",1,

384,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone! Did you see the article about the new community garden project near Playground?
[Message 2] Jamie: Oh, really? No, I missed that. Where was it?
[Message 3] River: I saw it too! It's on the Santa Ana city website. Near Small Hours, I think.
[Message 4] Casey: Small Hours? Isn't that where we were last week?
[Message 5] Alex: Yep! Right near there. They're converting that empty lot into a garden.
[Message 6] Jamie: That's awesome! We need more green spaces in Santa Ana.
[Message 7] River: Totally agree. It’ll be great for the neighborhood.
[Message 8] Casey: A garden sounds lovely. Will they have flowers?
[Message 9] Alex: The article mentioned vegetables and flowers, I think.
[Message 10] Jamie: I wonder if they'll need volunteers. I'd love to help.
[Message 11] River: Good point! Maybe we should look into it together.
[Message 12] Casey: Count me in! I'm pretty good at pulling weeds, apparently.
[Message 13] Alex: Haha, perfect! I'll see if I can find a contact person.
[Message 14] Jamie: Great! Thanks, Alex.
[Message 15] River: Awesome! Let me know what you find out.
[Message 16] Casey: Me too!
[Message 17] Alex: Will do. Also, unrelated, has anyone seen the new exhibit at the Bowers?
[Message 18] Jamie: No, what's it about?
[Message 19] River: I think it's some historical artifacts, right?
[Message 20] Casey: I haven't been to the Bowers in ages!
[Message 21] Alex: It’s supposed to be really interesting. Ancient pottery and stuff.
[Message 22] Jamie: Oh, that sounds cool. I might check that out next week.
[Message 23] River: Maybe we could all go sometime?
[Message 24] Casey: I'd be up for that!
[Message 25] Alex: Definitely! Let's coordinate something.
[Message 26] Jamie: Back to the garden, do you think they'll have workshops?
[Message 27] River: That would be amazing! Learning about gardening would be so helpful.
[Message 28] Casey: I could definitely use some gardening tips. My plants always die.
[Message 29] Alex: Maybe they'll have a composting program too.
[Message 30] Jamie: Oh, that would be fantastic!
[Message 31] River: It would be a great way to reduce waste.
[Message 32] Casey: Absolutely. Recycling is important too.
[Message 33] Alex: Speaking of important, I have to give a presentation at work next week.
[Message 34] Jamie: Oh no! What's it about?
[Message 35] River: Good luck! Presentations are always nerve-wracking.
[Message 36] Casey: I hate public speaking!
[Message 37] Alex: It's about some new sustainability initiatives.
[Message 38] Jamie: That's relevant to the garden! Good luck!
[Message 39] River: You'll do great, Alex! Just remember to breathe.

[Message 48] Casey: I'm working, unfortunately.

[Message 53] Alex: Will do! We'll tell you all about it.
[Message 54] Jamie: Any interesting news articles lately, Casey?
[Message 55] River: Yeah, what's been happening?
[Message 56] Casey: Just the usual political stuff, nothing too exciting.
[Message 57] Alex: Oh, that's good.
[Message 58] Jamie: I'm trying to avoid politics these days.
[Message 59] River: Me too. It's too stressful.
[Message 60] Casey: Fair enough. I understand.
[Message 61] Alex: What about local events? Anything interesting happening?
[Message 62] Jamie: I think there's a farmers market on Saturdays.
[Message 63] River: Oh yeah! I love the farmers market.
[Message 64] Casey: I haven't been to that one in a while.
[Message 65] Alex: Maybe we could go this weekend.
[Message 66] Jamie: That sounds like a plan!

[Message 68] Casey: I'll try to make it!
[Message 69] Alex: Great! I'll check the details and let you know.
[Message 70] Jamie: Thanks, Alex!
[Message 71] River: Awesome!
[Message 72] Casey: Appreciate it.
[Message 73] Alex: So, back to the presentation, any tips for dealing with stage fright?
[Message 74] Jamie: Imagine everyone in their underwear! (Just kidding!)
[Message 75] River: Haha! That's a classic.
[Message 76] Casey: Focus on your breathing.
[Message 77] Alex: Thanks! I'll try to remember that.
[Message 78] Jamie: Just remember you know your stuff.
[Message 79] River: And smile! It makes you seem more confident.

[Message 82] Jamie: What are you planning to wear?
[Message 83] River: That's a good question!
[Message 84] Casey: Dress professionally!
[Message 85] Alex: I was thinking something simple but presentable.
[Message 86] Jamie: A nice blazer would be perfect.
[Message 87] River: Or a collared shirt.
[Message 88] Casey: Dark colors are always a safe bet.
[Message 89] Alex: Good ideas, thanks!

[Message 104] Casey: I'm just going to order in.
[Message 105] Jamie: Pasta sounds good! What kind?
[Message 106] River: Probably just a simple tomato sauce.
[Message 107] Casey: Easy and delicious.
[Message 108] Jamie: I might make a salad.

385,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Ugh, another night, another weird dream. This time I was negotiating a business deal... with talking squirrels.""
[Message 2] Morgan: ""Talking squirrels? Sounds like you need more sleep, Alex. I dreamt I was back in the classroom, grading papers that never ended.""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Haha, that sounds like *your* kind of nightmare, Morgan. At least squirrels are slightly more entertaining than student essays, no offense.""
[Message 4] Morgan: ""None taken. Essays are the bane of my existence. Did these squirrels at least offer you a good deal?""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Honestly, I can't even remember the details. Just a lot of tiny voices and frantic gestures involving nuts. I woke up stressed!""
[Message 6] Morgan: ""Stress dreams are the worst. I think it's the Denver altitude getting to us both.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Could be. Or maybe it's the campfire smoke. Makes everything hazy.""
[Message 8] Morgan: ""True. Speaking of hazy, did you see that vintage Mustang parked down the road earlier? Gorgeous.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Oh yeah! Cherry red, right? I meant to get a closer look. You know your cars.""
[Message 10] Morgan: ""It was a beauty. Probably worth more than my retirement fund.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Retirement funds... Now *that's* a stressful topic.""
[Message 12] Morgan: ""Tell me about it. Anyway, back to your squirrel business deal. What were they selling, exactly?""
[Message 13] Alex: ""I wish I knew! Maybe it was political commentary disguised as rodent capitalism. Who knows what my subconscious is up to.""
[Message 14] Morgan: ""Ha! Political commentary. Now *that* would be truly terrifying. Everything's so polarized these days.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""You're telling me. Even in my dreams, I can't escape it.""
[Message 16] Morgan: ""I try to avoid it. Just stick to classic cars and the occasional documentary about birds.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Birds, huh? Peaceful. Maybe I should take up birdwatching.""
[Message 18] Morgan: ""It's surprisingly relaxing. Although, they can be surprisingly territorial little creatures.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Sounds a bit like the trucking industry, now that I think about it.""
[Message 20] Morgan: ""Everything's competitive, I suppose. Even squirrels selling...whatever they were selling.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Exactly! The dog-eat-dog (or squirrel-eat-nut) world.""
[Message 22] Morgan: ""So, are you planning on analyzing your dream further, or just chalking it up to campfire weirdness?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Probably just campfire weirdness. Unless I start seeing squirrels in pinstripe suits.""
[Message 24] Morgan: ""If that happens, I'm recommending a vacation. Preferably far, far away from Denver.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Deal. Somewhere with no squirrels and no political debates.""
[Message 26] Morgan: ""And definitely no endless stacks of essays to grade.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Agreed. So, what are you dreaming about tonight?""
[Message 28] Morgan: ""Hopefully something involving winning the lottery and buying that Mustang.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Now *that's* a dream worth having.""
[Message 30] Morgan: ""Indeed. Maybe I should start sleeping with a lottery ticket under my pillow.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Wouldn't hurt to try. Speaking of pillows, mine's gone completely flat.""
[Message 32] Morgan: ""Mine's not much better. Camping pillows are never luxurious.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Nope. Maybe we should invest in some inflatable ones for next time.""
[Message 34] Morgan: ""Good idea. I'll add it to the list. Along with a squirrel-proof business plan.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Haha! Please do. I'd love to see that.""
[Message 36] Morgan: ""It'll be a bestseller, I'm sure. 'Negotiating with Squirrels: A Pessimist's Guide.'""
[Message 37] Alex: ""I'd buy it! Especially if it includes tips for dealing with overly enthusiastic negotiators.""
[Message 38] Morgan: ""Those are the worst. Especially when they're armed with acorns.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Acorns of mass destruction!""
[Message 40] Morgan: ""Precisely. The future is terrifying.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Optimistic, aren't we?""
[Message 42] Morgan: ""Realistically pessimistic. There's a difference.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Fair enough. I guess I'm more of a cautiously optimistic person myself.""
[Message 44] Morgan: ""Admirable. Someone has to be.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""So, you think my dream squirrels were just a reflection of my anxieties about business dealings?""
[Message 46] Morgan: ""Probably. Or maybe you just need to eat fewer nuts before bed.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Could be. I did have a handful of trail mix before hitting the sleeping bag.""
[Message 48] Morgan: ""There you go. Mystery solved.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Simple as that, huh?""
[Message 50] Morgan: ""Usually is. Most of our weird dreams are just our brains processing the day's events in a bizarre way.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Makes sense. I had a crazy day on the road yesterday.""
[Message 52] Morgan: ""Long haul?""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Yep. Denver to Colorado Springs and back. Traffic was a nightmare.""
[Message 54] Morgan: ""I can imagine. I try to avoid driving during peak hours.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Smart move. Especially in a classic car like yours.""
[Message 56] Morgan: ""She's a delicate flower. Needs to be treated with respect.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""I understand. My truck's the same way. Gotta baby it to keep it running smoothly.""
[Message 58] Morgan: ""Exactly. So, less trail mix, more relaxation. That's my prescription for your squirrel problem.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""I'll try it. Although, relaxation isn't exactly my strong suit.""
[Message 60] Morgan: ""Practice makes perfect. Start with some deep breaths and a nice cup of chamomile tea.""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Chamomile tea... Sounds a little too peaceful for me.""
[Message 62] Morgan: ""Hey, you asked for help! I'm just offering solutions.""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Okay, okay. I'll try the tea. But if I start dreaming about talking chamomile flowers, I'm blaming you.""
[Message 64] Morgan: ""Deal. But if you start making millions selling chamomile flower merchandise, I get a cut.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Haha! You're on. 50/50 split.""
[Message 66] Morgan: ""Generous. I like the way you do business.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""Only with friends. Squirrels get no deals.""
[Message 68] Morgan: ""Good policy. They'd probably just hoard all the profits anyway.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""True. They're notoriously bad with finances.""
[Message 70] Morgan: ""Absolutely. Spend it all on nuts and forget about retirement.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Exactly! No long-term planning whatsoever.""
[Message 72] Morgan: ""A cautionary tale for us all.""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Indeed. Don't be like the squirrels.""
[Message 74] Morgan: ""Words to live by.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""So, ready for another potentially dream-filled night?""
[Message 76] Morgan: ""As ready as I'll ever be. Hoping for that lottery win.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Me too. Or at least a peaceful night's sleep.""
[Message 78] Morgan: ""That would be a victory in itself.""
[Message 79] Alex: ""Definitely. A victory over the squirrels, the traffic, and the flat pillows.""
[Message 80] Morgan: ""A trifecta of triumphs!""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Here's hoping. Good night, Morgan.""
[Message 82] Morgan: ""Good night, Alex. Sweet dreams (or at least not *too* weird ones).""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Thanks! You too.""
[Message 84] Morgan: ""I’m going to try some white noise tonight. See if that helps.""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Good idea! I should probably do that too.""
[Message 86] Morgan: ""There are some good apps for it.""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Thanks, I’ll look into that!""
[Message 88] Morgan: ""Alright. Sleep well!""
[Message 89] Alex: ""You too!""
[Message 90] Alex: ""Hey, Morgan, you still up?""
[Message 91] Morgan: ""Yeah, tossing and turning. White noise isn’t working.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""Same here! I keep thinking about those squirrels.""
[Message 93] Morgan: ""Ugh, they’re haunting us!""
[Message 94] Alex: ""Maybe we should have set a squirrel trap.""
[Message 95] Morgan: ""Ha! Then we'd have squirrel-related guilt on top of weird dreams.""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Good point. I just want to sleep!""
[Message 97] Morgan: ""Me too. Maybe a short walk?""
[Message 98] Alex: ""That’s not a bad idea. Some fresh air might help.""
[Message 99] Morgan: ""Meet me by the campfire in 5?""
[Message 100] Alex: ""Sounds like a plan.""
[Message 101] Morgan: ""Okay. See you there.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""Yep.""
[Message 103] Alex: ""The stars are pretty clear tonight.""
[Message 104] Morgan: ""They are. Helps to put things in perspective, doesn't it?""
[Message 105] Alex: ""Definitely. Makes the squirrel-based anxiety seem a little less significant.""
[Message 106] Morgan: ""Exactly. We're tiny specks on a tiny planet. Squirrels are even tinier.""
[Message 107] Alex: ""True, they're just fluffy little specks with negotiating skills.""
[Message 108] Morgan: ""Don't underestimate their power. They control the nut market.""
[Message 109] Alex: ""A valid point. Global nut domination.""
[Message 110] Morgan: ""It's the next big threat. Forget AI, worry about squirrels.""
[Message 111] Alex: ""I'm adding that to my list of anxieties.""
[Message 112] Morgan: ""You're welcome. Anything to help.""
[Message 113] Alex: ""So, any better ideas for conquering insomnia?""
[Message 114] Morgan: ""Counting sheep? Although, they might turn into squirrel-sheep hybrid creatures.""
[Message 115] Alex: ""Oh god, please no.""
[Message 116] Morgan: ""Okay, scratch that idea. How about focusing on pleasant memories?""
[Message 117] Alex: ""Like what? Happy trucking stories?""
[Message 118] Morgan: ""Whatever works! A beautiful sunset, a good cup of coffee, a friendly face.""
[Message 119] Alex: ""Okay, I'll try that. Good coffee... that's definitely a happy thought.""
[Message 120] Morgan: ""Me too. I can almost taste it.""
[Message 121] Alex: ""We should brew some in the morning.""
[Message 122] Morgan: ""Absolutely. First thing.""
[Message 123] Alex: ""Deal. Okay, I'm going to try heading back to my tent. Hopefully, the coffee thought will work its magic.""
[Message 124] Morgan: ""Good luck! I'll try the happy memory thing too. Maybe think about that Mustang.""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Sounds good. See you in the morning.""
[Message 126] Morgan: ""See you then. Hopefully, well-rested.""
[Message 127] Alex: ""Here's hoping!""
[Message 128] Morgan: ""Night!""
[Message 129] Alex: ""Night!""
[Message 130] Morgan: ""Well?""
[Message 131] Alex: ""Still awake.""
[Message 132] Morgan: ""Me too. This is ridiculous.""
[Message 133] Alex: ""Maybe we should just embrace the insomnia and have a philosophical debate.""
[Message 134] Morgan: ""About squirrels?""
[Message 135] Alex: ""About anything! The meaning of life, the best type of nut, the merits of chamomile tea...""
[Message 136] Morgan: ""Okay, okay. I'm in. Meaning of life, go.""
[Message 137] Alex: ""To drive a truck and deliver goods, enabling the world's economy to function. And maybe, occasionally, to admire a sunset.""
[Message 138] Morgan: ""To teach young minds and hope they don't become evil squirrels intent on world domination.""
[Message 139] Alex: ""Haha! I like that. A noble pursuit.""
[Message 140] Morgan: ""Now, best type of nut?""
[Message 141] Alex: ""Walnuts. Versatile and delicious.""
[Message 142] Morgan: ""Pecans. Sweet and decadent.""
[Message 143] Alex: ""Walnuts are more nutritious.""
[Message 144] Morgan: ""Pecans are more enjoyable.""
[Message 145] Alex: ""A matter of personal preference, I suppose.""
[Message 146] Morgan: ""Indeed. And chamomile tea?""
[Message 147] Alex: ""Still haven't tried it. But I'm willing to bet it's not as good as coffee.""
[Message 148] Morgan: ""Agreed. Coffee is the elixir of life.""
[Message 149] Alex: ""Absolutely. So, we've solved the meaning of life, debated nuts, and reaffirmed our love of coffee. Not a bad night for insomnia.""
[Message 150] Morgan: ""I agree. Actually, I think I'm starting to feel a little sleepy.""
[Message 151] Alex: ""Me too! Maybe the philosophical debate was the key.""
[Message 152] Morgan: ""Perhaps. Or maybe we've just exhausted ourselves.""
[Message 153] Alex: ""Either way, I'm going to try to sleep again.""
[Message 154] Morgan: ""Me too. Good night, Alex. For real this time.""
[Message 155] Alex: ""Good night, Morgan. Dream of coffee and world peace.""
[Message 156] Morgan: ""Sounds like a plan.""
[Message 157] Alex: ""Sweet dreams.""
[Message 158] Morgan: ""You too.""
[Message 159] Alex: ""Morning! Did you manage to get any sleep?""
[Message 160] Morgan: ""Surprisingly, yes! A few hours, at least. How about you?""
[Message 161] Alex: ""Same here. The philosophical debate seemed to work.""
[Message 162] Morgan: ""I guess so. No squirrel nightmares?""
[Message 163] Alex: ""Nope! Just peaceful dreams of driving down a sunny highway.""
[Message 164] Morgan: ""Excellent! I dreamt I finally bought that Mustang.""
[Message 165] Alex: ""Congratulations! In your dreams, at least.""
[Message 166] Morgan: ""For now. But one day...""
[Message 167] Alex: ""I believe in you! Now, coffee?""
[Message 168] Morgan: ""Absolutely. Let's make a pot.""
[Message 169] Alex: ""Sounds like the perfect start to the day.""
[Message 170] Morgan: ""Agreed. And maybe we can discuss our dream analyses over breakfast.""
[Message 171] Alex: ""Deal. But no more squirrel talk until after lunch.""
[Message 172] Morgan: ""Haha! You got it.""
[Message 173] Alex: ""Alright, let's get this coffee brewing!""
[Message 174] Morgan: ""On it!""
[Message 175] Alex: ""Ah, the smell of coffee in the morning... nothing better.""
[Message 176] Morgan: ""Indeed. It's the simple things in life.""
[Message 177] Alex: ""Exactly. Like good coffee, good company, and no talking squirrels.""
[Message 178] Morgan: ""Precisely. A perfect combination.""
[Message 179] Alex: ""Cheers to that!""
[Message 180] Morgan: ""Cheers!""
[Message 181] Alex: ""So, what kind of dreams are you hoping for tonight?""
[Message 182] Morgan: ""Something involving a tropical beach and a never-ending supply of coffee.""
[Message 183] Alex: ""Sounds idyllic. I'm hoping for more open roads and sunny skies.""
[Message 184] Morgan: ""Here's hoping we both get our wish.""
[Message 185] Alex: ""Fingers crossed! And maybe a few fewer nuts before bed tonight.""",0,

[Message 4] Sam: ""Haha, River. I'm up for anything relatively edible near here.""
[Message 5] Jordan: ""There's that new taco place a couple blocks down. Heard good things.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Tacos sound amazing! Anyone else into tacos?""
[Message 7] Jamie: ""Tacos are always a good idea! Especially on a workday.""
[Message 8] River: ""I'm in for tacos! I need a break from staring at paint samples.""
[Message 9] Sam: ""Tacos it is then. Jordan, what's the name of the place?""
[Message 10] Jordan: ""It's called 'Taco Time Machine' – cheesy, but apparently good.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Taco Time Machine? Okay, that's amazing. Let's do it.""

[Message 13] River: ""Give me five minutes to grab my purse. Be right there.""

[Message 15] Jordan: ""Alright, I'll meet you all there.""
[Message 16] Alex: ""Perfect! Tacos incoming!""
[Message 17] Jamie: ""Has anyone seen any interesting new gadgets at the hardware store today?""
[Message 18] River: ""I saw a pretty cool automatic plant waterer. Tempted to get it for my tomatoes.""
[Message 19] Sam: ""Automatic plant waterer? That sounds like something I need for my basil.""
[Message 20] Jordan: ""Okay, back to tacos – mild, medium, or hot sauce, people?""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Hot sauce all the way! Bring the heat!""
[Message 22] Jamie: ""Medium for me, please. I can't handle too much spice.""
[Message 23] River: ""I'll go mild. I'm a wimp when it comes to chili.""
[Message 24] Sam: ""Medium for me too, leaning towards mild. I'm indecisive.""
[Message 25] Jordan: ""Got it. One hot, two medium, one mild. I'll order accordingly.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""You're the best, Jordan! Thanks for taking charge.""
[Message 27] Jamie: ""Yes, thank you! I appreciate it.""
[Message 28] River: ""Much appreciated, Jordan! I'm starving.""

[Message 30] Jordan: ""No problem, guys. Happy to help. Almost there...""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Did anyone have teacher-student conferences this week?""
[Message 32] Jamie: ""Oh, yeah! I had one for my niece. It went pretty well, actually.""
[Message 33] River: ""I remember those! What grade is she in?""
[Message 34] Sam: ""I haven't had to deal with those in years. Feeling old now.""
[Message 35] Jordan: ""My nephew's are next month. Dreading it, honestly.""
[Message 36] Alex: ""My little brother's are coming up too. I'm kinda worried.""
[Message 37] Jamie: ""What are you worried about, Alex?""
[Message 38] River: ""Yeah, anything specific?""
[Message 39] Sam: ""He's probably just being a typical older sibling.""
[Message 40] Jordan: ""Probably stressing over grades, right?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Yeah, mostly grades and effort. He's a smart kid, just unmotivated.""
[Message 42] Jamie: ""That's tough. Maybe try talking to him about what he enjoys.""
[Message 43] River: ""Sometimes finding a connection to something they're passionate about helps.""
[Message 44] Sam: ""Definitely. Positive reinforcement goes a long way.""
[Message 45] Jordan: ""Yeah, focus on his strengths, not just his weaknesses.""

387,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Hey everyone! Ready for tonight's book club discussion? Super curious about what we all thought of 'The Shape of Water.'""
[Message 2] Ben: ""Yep, ready! Just finished making some snacks. Anyone have allergies I should know about?""
[Message 3] Charlie: ""Looking forward to it! No allergies here, Ben, thanks for asking.""
[Message 4] Dana: ""Me too! And Alex, that book was... something. Prepare for opinions!""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Haha, that's what I'm hoping for, Dana! Okay, let's start with the art. What did everyone think of the selkie mythology woven in?""
[Message 6] Ben: ""I thought it was beautifully done. The visual imagery the author created was amazing. I was practically smelling the salt water.""
[Message 7] Charlie: ""I enjoyed it, though I found the human/creature relationship a bit…questionable at times. The moral implications were interesting, though.""
[Message 8] Dana: ""Exactly, Charlie! I felt the same. The ethics got a bit muddy. But visually? Stunning. Especially the descriptions of the creature itself.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""I agree on both counts. Visually stunning, ethically…grey. Did it remind anyone of other art pieces, stories, or films?""
[Message 10] Ben: ""Kind of reminded me of some of the old Creature from the Black Lagoon movies, but with a much more sympathetic monster.""
[Message 11] Charlie: ""The depiction of the creature made me think of some of Guillermo del Toro's other work.""
[Message 12] Dana: ""Yeah, del Toro was my first thought too! Also, maybe a touch of Beauty and the Beast, but reversed?""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Good call on Beauty and the Beast! What about the use of silence as a form of communication? Especially with Eliza's muteness.""
[Message 14] Ben: ""That was powerful. It highlighted the idea that communication goes beyond just words. The art of gesture and expression.""
[Message 15] Charlie: ""Made me think about how much we take verbal communication for granted. And how much we miss when we don’t listen to other forms of expression.""
[Message 16] Dana: ""Absolutely. The silence was deafening, in a good way. It forced you to pay attention to the details.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Speaking of details, did anyone else find the 1960s setting significant? Cold War paranoia, etc.""
[Message 18] Ben: ""Definitely. Added another layer of tension and distrust. It was more than just a love story; it was about societal fears.""
[Message 19] Charlie: ""The Cold War backdrop highlighted the feeling of isolation and otherness that both characters experienced.""
[Message 20] Dana: ""Exactly! They were both outsiders, in their own ways, struggling against a rigid system.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""So, overall thoughts on the artistry? Was it effective? Did it enhance the story?""
[Message 22] Ben: ""Absolutely effective. The visual language was as important as the written one. It wouldn't have worked as well without it.""
[Message 23] Charlie: ""I agree. It made the fantastical elements believable and grounded the more abstract themes.""
[Message 24] Dana: ""Totally enhanced it. The descriptions of the creature, the set design, the costumes…all contributed to the atmosphere and the emotion.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Anyone find any flaws in the artistic execution?""
[Message 26] Ben: ""Hmm, maybe some of the symbolism felt a little heavy-handed at times. But overall, minor complaints.""
[Message 27] Charlie: ""I agree with Ben. Occasionally, the symbolism was a bit on the nose.""
[Message 28] Dana: ""Yeah, sometimes it felt like the author was trying too hard to make a point. But I can overlook it.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Okay, moving on! What about the characters' motivations? Were they believable? Particularly Elisa’s?""
[Message 30] Ben: ""I think Elisa's loneliness made her motivations very understandable. She craved connection, and she found it in the most unexpected place.""
[Message 31] Charlie: ""Her empathy was incredibly strong. It drove her actions, even when they were risky.""
[Message 32] Dana: ""I found her motivations believable. She was an outcast, and the creature was an outcast too. It was a natural connection.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Did the ending work for everyone? Or did it feel too…fairy tale?""
[Message 34] Ben: ""I thought it was perfect. A little bit of magic and hope in a cynical world.""
[Message 35] Charlie: ""I was okay with the ending. It suited the tone of the book, even if it was a bit saccharine.""
[Message 36] Dana: ""It was a bit cheesy, but I liked it. Sometimes you need a happy ending, even if it's unrealistic.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Speaking of happy endings, did anyone catch the Tigers game last night? What a nail-biter!""
[Message 38] Ben: ""Oh man, I missed it! Was it good?""
[Message 39] Charlie: ""Heard it went into extra innings. Intense!""
[Message 40] Dana: ""Yeah, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! Anyway, back to the book… the ending solidified the theme of love conquering all.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""True, Dana! Okay, so to wrap up, what's everyone's overall rating of the book on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the best?""
[Message 42] Ben: ""I'd give it a solid 4. The artistry was incredible, but the symbolism was a bit much at times.""
[Message 43] Charlie: ""I'd say a 3.5. Enjoyable, but not perfect.""
[Message 44] Dana: ""I'm going with a 4. It captivated me, despite its flaws.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Okay, interesting spread! I'm leaning towards a 4 as well. The visuals were just too compelling. Thanks for the discussion, everyone!""
[Message 46] Ben: ""Thanks for hosting, Alex! Always a good time.""
[Message 47] Charlie: ""Good chat, everyone! See you all next time.""
[Message 48] Dana: ""Yeah, thanks Alex! Until next month!""
[Message 49] Alex: ""So, anyone have any books in mind for next month's discussion? Open to suggestions!""
[Message 50] Ben: ""I was thinking maybe 'Circe' by Madeline Miller? It's got some great mythological elements.""
[Message 51] Charlie: ""That sounds interesting, Ben! I've heard good things about it.""
[Message 52] Dana: ""Ooh, I like that idea! I've been meaning to read that one.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Circe it is then! Gives us all plenty of time to read. Any other suggestions?""
[Message 54] Ben: ""I can always suggest something. I'm an avid reader.""
[Message 55] Charlie: ""Always happy to hear suggestions. Broadens the horizon.""
[Message 56] Dana: ""Me too! Throw them out there!""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Anyone got anything else on their mind before we sign off?""
[Message 58] Ben: ""Not really. I'm just thinking about dinner, haha. Maybe I'll make pasta.""
[Message 59] Charlie: ""Enjoy your pasta, Ben! I'm going to listen to some music. Something classical, I think.""
[Message 60] Dana: ""Sounds lovely, Charlie. I'm going to try to get some writing done. Finally tackling that short story.""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Good luck with the writing, Dana! I'm going to work on my latest sculpture. Been meaning to get back to it.""
[Message 62] Ben: ""Nice! What are you sculpting, Alex?""
[Message 63] Charlie: ""Always admire your dedication to your art, Alex.""
[Message 64] Dana: ""Yeah, Alex, what's the sculpture of?""
[Message 65] Alex: ""It's a human face made with steel.""
[Message 66] Ben: ""Steel, huh? I bet it's heavy!""

[Message 21] LIAM: (To ANNA) You heard about Judge Thompson and Mark? At Retail Store?
[Message 22] ANNA: (To LIAM) Yeah, awful. What about it?
[Message 23] LIAM: (To ANNA) Noah said he heard Alex was near the store that night. Around Predawn.
[Message 24] ANNA: (To LIAM) Alex? Seriously? I thought they were all talk.
[Message 25] LIAM: (To ANNA) Me too. But it's weird, right?
[Message 26] ANNA: (To LIAM) Super weird. I saw Alex arguing with Judge Thompson once, outside the courthouse. Something about a ruling.
[Message 27] LIAM: (To ANNA) See? Maybe it *is* political.
[Message 28] ANNA: (To LIAM) Could be. Hey, I gotta run. Need to eat. Let's talk tomorrow?
[Message 29] LIAM: (To ANNA) Yeah, definitely.
[Message 30] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Did Liam seem off to you?
[Message 31] NOAH: (To CHLOE) Little bit. Why?
[Message 32] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Just seemed extra concerned about Alex. Like he was defending them too much.
[Message 33] NOAH: (To CHLOE) Maybe he's just trying to be fair.
[Message 34] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Maybe. Or maybe he knows something he's not telling us.
[Message 35] NOAH: (To CHLOE) What are you implying, Chloe?
[Message 36] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Nothing, nothing. Just thinking out loud.
[Message 37] NOAH: (To CHLOE) Right...
[Message 38] ALEX: (To SAM) Did you see what they're saying about me online?
[Message 39] SAM: (To ALEX) Yeah, it's messed up. People are jumping to conclusions.
[Message 40] ALEX: (To SAM) They're saying I killed Judge Thompson! Because I protested her once!
[Message 41] SAM: (To ALEX) I know, it's ridiculous. Where were you that night anyway?
[Message 42] ALEX: (To SAM) At home! Watching bad reality TV. You know me.
[Message 43] SAM: (To ALEX) Okay, just checking. The cops are probably going to want to know.
[Message 44] ALEX: (To SAM) Great. Just what I need.
[Message 45] NOAH: (To LIAM) Hey man, wanna grab a beer tonight?
[Message 46] LIAM: (To NOAH) Can't. Promised my aunt I'd help her with her taxes.
[Message 47] NOAH: (To LIAM) Right. Taxes. Sure.
[Message 48] NOAH: (To CHLOE) Liam bailed on me. Said he's doing taxes.
[Message 49] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Taxes? On a Tuesday night? Sus.
[Message 50] ANNA: (To LIAM) Hey, did you see that old Mr. Henderson died last week?
[Message 51] LIAM: (To ANNA) No way! Really? Poor guy.
[Message 52] ANNA: (To LIAM) Yeah, found him in his apartment. Sad.
[Message 53] LIAM: (To ANNA) Wow. That's...a lot to process.
[Message 54] ANNA: (To LIAM) I know, right? Anyway, about yesterday, maybe we should just stay out of it.
[Message 55] LIAM: (To ANNA) Stay out of...the Retail Store thing? Why?
[Message 56] ANNA: (To LIAM) It's not our business, Liam. Let the police handle it.
[Message 57] LIAM: (To ANNA) But what if Alex *did* do it? They could get away with it!
[Message 58] ANNA: (To LIAM) And what if they *didn't*? We could ruin their life. Just saying.
[Message 59] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Something's definitely up with Liam. He's avoiding me.
[Message 60] NOAH: (To CHLOE) Told you. He knows something.
[Message 61] SAM: (To ALEX) They found an Stabbing with an ice pick near the scene.
[Message 62] ALEX: (To SAM) An Stabbing with an ice pick? So? That doesn't mean anything!
[Message 63] SAM: (To ALEX) Just saying, it's not helping your case. Did you tell the cops about the protests?
[Message 64] ALEX: (To SAM) Of course not! Why would I bring that up?
[Message 65] SAM: (To ALEX) Because if they find out later, it'll look even worse.
[Message 66] ANNA: (To LIAM) I heard the security guard was trying to stop someone from stealing something that night. If he hadn't tried, maybe he'd still be alive.
[Message 67] LIAM: (To ANNA) So you think Mark was just in the wrong place at the wrong time? What about Judge Thompson?
[Message 68] ANNA: (To LIAM) Maybe she saw something she wasn't supposed to. Or maybe Alex had a legitimate reason. I don't know Liam, but they are going away for a long time for this.
[Message 69] NOAH: (To CHLOE) So, Liam's aunt confirmed he wasn't helping her with taxes.
[Message 70] CHLOE: (To NOAH) Called it! Where was he then...?",1,
389,"[Message 1] Liam: ""Morning, folks. Long line today.""
[Message 2] Maya: ""Tell me about it. Just trying to ship this before noon.""
[Message 3] Noah: ""Hey. Yeah, busy.""
[Message 4] Liam: ""So, Maya, how was that… thing last night?""
[Message 5] Maya: ""Complicated.""
[Message 6] Liam: ""Complicated how? In a good way?""
[Message 7] Maya: ""There are… layers.""
[Message 8] Noah: ""Layers, huh?""
[Message 9] Liam: ""Like an onion? Were there tears?""
[Message 10] Maya: ""Let’s just say the recipe needs tweaking.""
[Message 11] Noah: ""Recipe? Is this about the bake-off?""
[Message 12] Liam: ""A bake-off? I thought it was a… seminar.""
[Message 13] Maya: ""Tomato, tomahto. Same difference.""
[Message 14] Liam: ""Semantics.""
[Message 15] Noah: ""So, everything… went as expected?""
[Message 16] Maya: ""Define 'expected'.""
[Message 17] Liam: ""Oh, come on, Maya, spill.""
[Message 18] Maya: ""Spilling is exactly what I'm trying to avoid.""
[Message 19] Noah: ""Smart move.""
[Message 20] Liam: ""But I'm so curious! Was it a 'success'?""
[Message 21] Maya: ""It was… an experience.""
[Message 22] Liam: ""An experience like skydiving? Or like… a root canal?""
[Message 23] Maya: ""Somewhere in that ballpark.""
[Message 24] Noah: ""Rough ballpark.""
[Message 25] Liam: ""Ouch. So, who else was… experiencing?""
[Message 26] Maya: ""A select few.""
[Message 27] Liam: ""Anyone I know?""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Probably.""
[Message 29] Noah: ""Best not to name names.""
[Message 30] Liam: ""Protecting the innocent, are we?""
[Message 31] Maya: ""Innocence is a relative term.""
[Message 32] Liam: ""True. So, what went 'wrong'?""
[Message 33] Maya: ""Wrong is subjective.""
[Message 34] Noah: ""Perspective is key.""
[Message 35] Liam: ""Alright, alright. What didn't go 'right' then?""
[Message 36] Maya: ""Certain… expectations weren’t met.""
[Message 37] Liam: ""Whose expectations?""
[Message 38] Maya: ""Everyone's, maybe.""
[Message 39] Noah: ""Hard to say.""
[Message 40] Liam: ""This is like pulling teeth. Was there… a disagreement?""
[Message 41] Maya: ""Let's just say there were… differing interpretations.""
[Message 42] Liam: ""Interpretations of what?""
[Message 43] Maya: ""Of the… guidelines.""
[Message 44] Noah: ""There were guidelines?""
[Message 45] Liam: ""Guidelines, huh? Sounds official.""
[Message 46] Maya: ""They were supposed to be.""
[Message 47] Liam: ""Supposed to be?""
[Message 48] Noah: ""Things didn't go as planned, clearly.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""Clearly. So, what happens now?""
[Message 50] Maya: ""Now we… reassess.""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Reassess the guidelines?""
[Message 52] Maya: ""The whole situation.""
[Message 53] Noah: ""From the ground up.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Sounds serious. Legal stuff?""
[Message 55] Maya: ""Let's hope not.""
[Message 56] Noah: ""Fingers crossed.""
[Message 57] Liam: ""So, if I hypothetically wanted to… avoid a similar 'experience', what should I do?""
[Message 58] Maya: ""Read the fine print.""
[Message 59] Noah: ""Twice.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""And understand the… subtext?""
[Message 61] Maya: ""Absolutely.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""Noted. Thanks for the… warning.""
[Message 63] Maya: ""Anytime. Gotta run. This package won’t ship itself.""
[Message 64] Noah: ""Later, Maya.""
[Message 65] Liam: ""See ya.""
[Message 66] Maya: ""Bye.""
[Message 67] Liam: ""So, Noah… you were there too, right?""
[Message 68] Noah: ""Yeah. Briefly.""
[Message 69] Liam: ""Briefly? As in, you saw the… explosion?""
[Message 70] Noah: ""Let’s just say I observed… a reaction.""
[Message 71] Liam: ""A reaction? To what?""
[Message 72] Noah: ""To… the conditions.""
[Message 73] Liam: ""The guidelines? The fine print?""
[Message 74] Noah: ""All of the above.""
[Message 75] Liam: ""And you think it’s going to get… messy?""
[Message 76] Noah: ""Potentially.""
[Message 77] Liam: ""Potentially messy as in… lawyers?""
[Message 78] Noah: ""Potentially messy as in… complicated conversations.""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Conversations like this one?""
[Message 80] Noah: ""Exactly.""
[Message 81] Liam: ""So, what’s your take? Whose fault was it?""
[Message 82] Noah: ""Fault is a… strong word.""
[Message 83] Liam: ""A… misstep?""
[Message 84] Noah: ""A series of… misunderstandings.""
[Message 85] Liam: ""Misunderstandings that could cost people… their reputations?""
[Message 86] Noah: ""Reputations are… fragile things.""
[Message 87] Liam: ""So, damage control is necessary?""
[Message 88] Noah: ""Damage control is always… advisable.""
[Message 89] Liam: ""Even if you weren't directly involved?""
[Message 90] Noah: ""Especially if you weren’t directly involved. Deniability.""
[Message 91] Liam: ""Smart. Very smart. But if someone *were* directly involved…""
[Message 92] Noah: ""Then they should probably… consult someone.""
[Message 93] Liam: ""Consult someone like a… professional?""
[Message 94] Noah: ""Perhaps.""
[Message 95] Liam: ""Okay, okay. I get it. Mum’s the word.""
[Message 96] Noah: ""Precisely.""
[Message 97] Liam: ""But just between you and me… did anyone lose their cool?""
[Message 98] Noah: ""The temperature… definitely rose.""
[Message 99] Liam: ""Rose as in… yelling?""
[Message 100] Noah: ""As in… passionate discussion.""
[Message 101] Liam: ""Passionate discussion involving… raised voices?""
[Message 102] Noah: ""Possibly.""
[Message 103] Liam: ""And… accusations?""
[Message 104] Noah: ""Interpretations.""
[Message 105] Liam: ""Right. Interpretations. So, what's the… fallout going to be?""
[Message 106] Noah: ""Time will tell.""
[Message 107] Liam: ""Time… and lawyers.""
[Message 108] Noah: ""Potentially.""
[Message 109] Liam: ""Alright, I think I've gleaned enough. Thanks, Noah.""
[Message 110] Noah: ""No problem, Liam. Just… be discreet.""
[Message 111] Liam: ""Discretion is my middle name. Almost.""
[Message 112] Noah: ""Good. Gotta get going myself. Late for a… meeting.""
[Message 113] Liam: ""A meeting about… guidelines?""
[Message 114] Noah: ""You never know.""
[Message 115] Liam: ""Right. See ya.""
[Message 116] Noah: ""Later.""
[Message 117] Liam: ""Okay, now I'm REALLY curious…""
[Message 118] Liam: ""(Thinking to himself) Guidelines, reactions, raised voices…""
[Message 119] Liam: ""What could possibly have happened?""
[Message 120] Liam: ""Maybe I should call Sarah…""
[Message 121] Liam: ""Nah, she'd never tell me anything.""
[Message 122] Liam: ""But maybe if I phrase it right…""
[Message 123] Liam: ""No, better not. I'll just wait and see.""
[Message 124] Liam: ""Easier said than done.""
[Message 125] Liam: ""This line is moving SO slowly…""
[Message 126] Liam: ""I wonder if the post office has… guidelines…""
[Message 127] Liam: ""Probably. Everything does these days.""
[Message 128] Liam: ""Maybe I should just give up and go home.""
[Message 129] Liam: ""No, I need to mail this…""
[Message 130] Liam: ""Ugh, what a morning.""
[Message 131] Liam: ""I hope Maya and Noah are okay…""
[Message 132] Liam: ""Or at least… not in too much trouble.""
[Message 133] Liam: ""Trouble… that's probably an understatement.""
[Message 134] Liam: ""Maybe I should just… pretend I didn't hear anything.""
[Message 135] Liam: ""Yeah, that's the smart thing to do.""
[Message 136] Liam: ""But where's the fun in that?""
[Message 137] Liam: ""Okay, seriously, focus on the package, Liam.""
[Message 138] Liam: ""Get in, get out, no questions asked.""
[Message 139] Liam: ""Easier said than done.""

390,"[Message 1] Liam: ""Hey guys, you hear about what happened at Crosswalk last night?""
[Message 2] Maya: ""Yeah, awful. Poor Ethan.""
[Message 3] Kai: ""Ethan? The journalist? What happened?""
[Message 4] Liam: ""Murdered. Brutal.""
[Message 5] Sam: ""OMG. Seriously? I was just talking to him last week.""
[Message 6] Maya: ""I know, right? It's so shocking.""
[Message 7] Kai: ""Jesus. Any idea who did it?""
[Message 8] Liam: ""Rumors flying. Cops aren't saying much.""
[Message 9] Sam: ""This is insane. I hope they catch whoever did this.""
[Message 10] Maya: ""Me too. Ethan didn't deserve this.""
[Message 11] Kai: ""Did you guys see anything weird last night? Around midnight?""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Nah, I was home binge-watching TV. You?""
[Message 13] Sam: ""I was at the movies. Double feature. Popcorn headache from hell.""
[Message 14] Maya: ""I was... out for a walk. Needed some air.""
[Message 15] Kai: ""A walk? Where?""
[Message 16] Maya: ""Just around. Doesn't matter. Why all the questions, Kai?""
[Message 17] Kai: ""Just curious. It's a small city. We all need to be aware.""
[Message 18] Liam: ""True. Lock your doors, people.""
[Message 19] Sam: ""You got that right. Stay safe, everyone.""
[Message 20] Maya: ""You too.""
[Message 21] Kai: ""Okay, I'm out. Gotta run some errands.""
[Message 22] Liam: ""Later, Kai.""
[Message 23] Sam: ""Bye!""
[Message 24] Maya: ""Later.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""Hey, Maya, one sec. Did you see anyone near Crosswalk when you were walking?""
[Message 26] Maya: ""I said I was just walking around. Why are you so fixated on Crosswalk?""
[Message 27] Kai: ""Just trying to help the cops, okay? Relax.""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Look, I didn't see anything suspicious. Happy?""
[Message 29] Kai: ""Fine. Just… be careful.""
[Message 30] Maya: ""Always am.""
[Message 31] Liam: ""Anyone know if Ethan had any enemies? I can't imagine why someone would want to hurt him.""
[Message 32] Sam: ""He wrote that piece on the mayor's corruption, right? Maybe that ticked someone off.""
[Message 33] Maya: ""That's a good point, Sam. He wasn't afraid to ruffle feathers.""
[Message 34] Kai: ""Yeah, but murder? Seems extreme, even for that.""
[Message 35] Liam: ""You never know, Kai. People are crazy.""
[Message 36] Sam: ""Did you know him well, Liam?""
[Message 37] Liam: ""Just casually. We grabbed coffee a couple of times. He was working on a story about the new development plans.""
[Message 38] Maya: ""Oh, the one that's supposed to go up near the park?""
[Message 39] Liam: ""Yeah, that's the one. He said there were some shady dealings involved.""
[Message 40] Kai: ""See? Motive everywhere.""
[Message 41] Sam: ""So, Maya, you were out walking near Crosswalk… that's not too far from your place, is it?""
[Message 42] Maya: ""No, it's not. So what?""
[Message 43] Sam: ""Just saying, small world.""
[Message 44] Maya: ""I'm going to ignore that. I'm busy.""
[Message 45] Liam: ""Don't be like that, Maya. We're all just freaked out.""
[Message 46] Kai: ""Seriously. Someone used a garrote. That's not exactly a spur-of-the-moment thing.""
[Message 47] Sam: ""A garrote? Jesus. Where did you hear that, Kai?""
[Message 48] Kai: ""It's all over the news sites now.""
[Message 49] Maya: ""I hadn't seen that part. That's… disturbing.""
[Message 50] Liam: ""I hope they catch whoever did this soon. Before they hurt anyone else.""
[Message 51] Sam: ""Me too. Night, everyone.""
[Message 52] Maya: ""Night.""
[Message 53] Kai: ""Night.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Night.""
[Message 55] Kai: ""Liam, you up?""
[Message 56] Liam: ""Yeah, just catching up on some work. What's up?""
[Message 57] Kai: ""Something's not right with Maya's story. She's being cagey.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Maybe she's just shaken up. It's a terrible thing.""
[Message 59] Kai: ""Maybe. But she knew Ethan. They dated for a while last year.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Seriously? I didn't know that.""
[Message 61] Kai: ""Yeah. And it didn't end well. I heard he broke it off because she was getting too intense.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""Wow. That changes things.""
[Message 63] Kai: ""Exactly. Remember how she got fired from her job? Because of Ethan's story about the construction company?""
[Message 64] Liam: ""Oh yeah! He purposefully exposed them!""
[Message 65] Kai: ""And now he's dead. Think that's a coincidence?""
[Message 66] Liam: ""So you think she intended to…?""
[Message 67] Kai: ""I'm not saying anything for sure. But it's worth considering.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""I guess so. But a garrote? That's… premeditated.""
[Message 69] Kai: ""Someone who planned to hurt her probably thought about how to get away with it, Liam.""
[Message 70] Liam: ""True. I just can't believe Maya would be capable of that.""
[Message 71] Kai: ""People are capable of a lot when they're angry.""
[Message 72] Liam: ""I guess. I'm going to try and get some sleep. This is all too much.""
[Message 73] Kai: ""Yeah, me too. Keep me posted if you hear anything else.""
[Message 74] Liam: ""Will do.""
[Message 75] Maya: ""Sam, you still up?""
[Message 76] Sam: ""Yeah, can't sleep. This Ethan thing is messing with my head.""
[Message 77] Maya: ""Tell me about it. Kai's acting so weird.""
[Message 78] Sam: ""Weird how?""
[Message 79] Maya: ""Just grilling me about my walk last night. Like I'm a suspect or something.""
[Message 80] Sam: ""Kai's always been a little… intense.""
[Message 81] Maya: ""Intense? He's being accusatory. He knew about me and Ethan.""
[Message 82] Sam: ""Everyone knew about you and Ethan. It wasn't exactly a secret.""
[Message 83] Maya: ""But he's making it sound like I had a reason to… you know.""
[Message 84] Sam: ""Look, don't worry about Kai. He's just trying to be a detective.""
[Message 85] Maya: ""Easy for you to say. You weren't out for a walk near the scene of the crime.""
[Message 86] Sam: ""I told you, I was at the movies. I have a stub right here, if they don't believe I was there.""
[Message 87] Maya: ""Yeah, well, I don't have an alibi like that. I was just… walking.""
[Message 88] Sam: ""Then just tell them the truth. You were walking, you didn't see anything. What's the big deal?""
[Message 89] Maya: ""It's not that simple.""
[Message 90] Sam: ""Why not? What aren't you telling me, Maya?""
[Message 91] Maya: ""Nothing. I just… I don't want to get involved.""
[Message 92] Sam: ""Too late for that. You already are.""
[Message 93] Maya: ""I gotta go. I'm exhausted.""
[Message 94] Sam: ""Whatever. Just be careful, okay?""
[Message 95] Maya: ""Always am.""
[Message 96] Kai: ""Sam, you awake?""
[Message 97] Sam: ""Yep. What's up?""
[Message 98] Kai: ""I think Maya's hiding something. Did you talk to her?""
[Message 99] Sam: ""Yeah, she's freaking out because you were questioning her.""
[Message 100] Kai: ""Well, she's acting suspicious. Did she say anything weird to you?""
[Message 101] Sam: ""Just that she doesn't want to get involved.""
[Message 102] Kai: ""Exactly! Why wouldn't she want to get involved if she's innocent?""
[Message 103] Sam: ""Maybe she's just scared. It's a murder investigation, Kai.""
[Message 104] Kai: ""Maybe. Or maybe she's trying to cover something up.""
[Message 105] Sam: ""You're really going down this road, huh?""
[Message 106] Kai: ""I'm just saying, don't rule anything out. Ethan was only 22! He had his whole life ahead of him.""
[Message 107] Sam: ""I'm not ruling anything out. I just don't want to jump to conclusions.""
[Message 108] Kai: ""Fair enough. But keep your eyes open, okay?""
[Message 109] Sam: ""Will do.""
[Message 110] Kai: ""Hey, did Ethan fire someone recently?""
[Message 111] Sam: ""I think so. Someone from that construction company. Why?""
[Message 112] Kai: ""Just wondering if maybe they had a motive.""
[Message 113] Sam: ""Could be. Lots of possibilities.""
[Message 114] Kai: ""Alright. Talk to you later.""
[Message 115] Sam: ""Later.""
[Message 116] Liam: ""Hey, Sam. You hear from Maya today?""
[Message 117] Sam: ""No, why?""
[Message 118] Liam: ""She's not answering her phone. I'm starting to get worried.""
[Message 119] Sam: ""Maybe her battery died. Or she's just avoiding everyone.""
[Message 120] Liam: ""Maybe. But I have a bad feeling about this.""
[Message 121] Sam: ""Don't jump to conclusions, Liam. I'm sure she's fine.""
[Message 122] Liam: ""I hope so. I'm going to try her again later.""
[Message 123] Sam: ""Alright. Let me know if you hear anything.""
[Message 124] Liam: ""Will do.""
[Message 125] Maya: ""Hey guys, sorry I went dark. Phone died.""
[Message 126] Liam: ""Maya! Thank god. We were worried.""
[Message 127] Sam: ""Yeah, you had us all freaked out.""
[Message 128] Kai: ""Where were you?""
[Message 129] Maya: ""Just… dealing with some stuff. I needed some space.""
[Message 130] Liam: ""We understand. Just glad you're okay.""
[Message 131] Sam: ""Yeah, me too.""
[Message 132] Kai: ""What kind of stuff?""
[Message 133] Maya: ""Personal stuff, Kai. It's none of your business.""
[Message 134] Kai: ""Just making sure you're not, you know, on the run.""
[Message 135] Maya: ""Are you seriously accusing me of something, Kai?""
[Message 136] Kai: ""I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm just asking questions.""
[Message 137] Liam: ""Alright, guys, let's just calm down. This is getting out of hand.""
[Message 138] Sam: ""Yeah, seriously. Can we just drop it?""
[Message 139] Maya: ""Thank you, Liam and Sam. I appreciate it.""
[Message 140] Kai: ""Fine. But if you're hiding something, Maya, it's going to come out eventually.""
[Message 141] Maya: ""I'm not hiding anything.""
[Message 142] Liam: ""Okay, that's enough. We're all stressed. Let's just try to support each other.""
[Message 143] Sam: ""Agreed. Anyone want to grab some food later? We can all use a distraction.""
[Message 144] Maya: ""I don't know… I'm not really in the mood.""
[Message 145] Kai: ""I'm in. I could use a burger.""
[Message 146] Liam: ""Yeah, I'm down. Maya, you sure you don't want to come?""
[Message 147] Maya: ""Maybe later. I need some more time to myself.""
[Message 148] Sam: ""Alright. We'll catch you later then.""
[Message 149] Maya: ""Okay. Be safe.""
[Message 150] Kai: ""So, Liam, you think she's telling the truth?""
[Message 151] Liam: ""About what?""
[Message 152] Kai: ""About not hiding anything.""
[Message 153] Liam: ""I don't know, Kai. I want to believe her. But I can't shake the feeling that something's off.""
[Message 154] Kai: ""Me neither. I bet she was looking up how to make Using a garrote online!""
[Message 155] Liam: ""Let's not go there, Kai. That's a serious accusation.""
[Message 156] Kai: ""I'm just saying, we need to consider all the possibilities. Especially considering the death penalty is on the table.""
[Message 157] Liam: ""I know, I know. It's just hard to imagine.""
[Message 158] Kai: ""I saw her buying rope at the hardware store yesterday. I thought it was weird. But now…""
[Message 159] Liam: ""Rope? Seriously?""
[Message 160] Kai: ""Yeah. I didn't think anything of it at the time. But it was that thin, strong kind of rope… like for a garrote.""
[Message 161] Liam: ""Okay, that's… concerning. We need to tell the cops.""
[Message 162] Kai: ""I already did. Anonymously. They should be looking into it.""
[Message 163] Liam: ""Good. This is insane.""
[Message 164] Sam: ""Hey, you guys at the burger place yet?""
[Message 165] Kai: ""Yeah, we just got here. Liam's freaking out about Maya.""

[Message 182] Maya: ""He's been skimming money from his company. Ethan was about to expose him. He probably provoked him!""
[Message 183] Sam: ""But why would Kai tell the cops I saw her buying rope if he was the one who did it?""
[Message 184] Maya: ""I thought you would know by now. He's trying to frame me. I know he is. He's always been jealous of my success as a woman and my status over him""
[Message 185] Sam: ""Are you sure about this, Maya? This is a huge accusation.""
[Message 186] Maya: ""I'm positive. Think about it. He was the one pushing the garrote angle. He knew all the details. It's him, Sam. It has to be him. He called to prevent me from calling 911 to save Ethan!""

[Message 21] Sarah: ""Ryan? Why?""
[Message 22] Alex: ""Apparently, he and Margaret had some kind of falling out recently.""
[Message 23] David: ""About what?""

[Message 35] Sarah: ""Did you see anyone else?""
[Message 36] David: ""No, just him. He was carrying something long, I think a golf club cover.""
[Message 37] Sarah: ""A golf club? I thought that was how Margaret was killed.""
[Message 38] David: ""They are saying it was a golf club.""
[Message 39] Sarah: ""Okay, that's definitely suspicious.""
[Message 40] David: ""Tell me about it. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""

[Message 53] Alex: ""Damn. That's messed up.""
[Message 54] David: ""I know, right? I'm calling the cops now.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Good. He needs to pay for what he did. He was fired, and that's why.""
[Message 56] Sarah: ""Fired?""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Yeah, Margaret fired him last week. I heard she was performance review and that’s why he wanted to get rid of her""

[Message 69] David: ""Hmm, interesting.""
[Message 70] Sarah: ""Yeah, and he was being all weird about it, like trying to hide it when I asked where he got it.""
[Message 71] David: ""Maybe we should tell the cops about that too.""
[Message 72] Sarah: ""Definitely. It's worth a shot.""
[Message 73] David: ""Alright, I'll give them a call back.""

[Message 79] Sarah: ""David also told them about your golf club, Alex.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""My golf club? What about it?""
[Message 81] Sarah: ""Just that you have one, and Margaret was killed with a golf club.""
[Message 82] Alex: ""Oh, that's ridiculous. I haven't even used that club in months. I was with Jessica and Mark. You can ask them.""
[Message 83] David: ""They told you I saw you leaving the scene?""
[Message 84] Alex: ""No, they didn't. What did you tell them exactly?""
[Message 85] David: ""I told them I saw someone who looked like you, carrying a golf club cover, heading away from the Subway Station around Early Hours.""

[Message 87] Sarah: ""Alex, calm down. We're just trying to figure out what happened.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""Calm down? You're accusing me of murder! This is insane!""
[Message 89] David: ""We're not accusing you of anything. We just want to know the truth.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""The truth is, I was with Jessica and Mark. Ask them! I'm going to lawyer up. This is ridiculous.""
[Message 91] Sarah: ""Okay, Alex, just breathe. We'll talk to Jessica and Mark.""
[Message 92] David: ""Yeah, maybe there's been a misunderstanding.""

[Message 4] Liam: Seriously. Did you know her well?

[Message 5] Chloe: Not *well* well, but we chatted sometimes. She seemed nice. You?

[Message 6] Liam: Same. Used the same equipment. Small talk.

[Message 7] Chloe: The news said something about Poisoning via inhalation. How awful.

[Message 8] Liam: Yeah, brutal. I heard they found something suspicious nearby.

[Message 9] Chloe: Ugh, this whole thing gives me the creeps. I hope they catch whoever did this.

[Message 10] Liam: Me too. Justice for Sarah.

[Message 11] Chloe: Amen to that. So, how's work been? Anything exciting?

[Message 12] Liam: Same old, same old. Paperwork, deadlines... the usual grind.

[Message 13] Chloe: Tell me about it. I'm drowning in emails.

[Message 14] Liam: You going to the vigil tonight?

[Message 15] Chloe: I was thinking about it. Are you?

[Message 16] Liam: Probably. Seems like the right thing to do.

[Message 17] Chloe: Agreed. It will be good to show respect.

[Message 24] Maya: Just wondering. I saw her arguing with someone a few days ago.

[Message 25] Chloe: Really? Who?

[Message 26] Maya: I didn't get a good look. Just a woman... kinda soft spoken.

[Message 27] Chloe: Hmm, interesting. Did they seem really angry?

[Message 28] Maya: Yeah, pretty heated. I almost stepped in.

[Message 29] Chloe: You should tell the police, Maya. That could be important.

[Message 30] Maya: I will, I just wanted to see if you knew anything first.

[Message 31] Chloe: Nope, nothing like that. Thanks for the info, though.

[Message 35] Liam: ""I might try one for Buster. He's a bit of a dummy, but maybe it'll entertain him.""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Let me know how it goes!""
[Message 37] River: ""Will do!""
[Message 38] Liam: ""Okay, heading home now. Talk later!""
[Message 39] Jordan: ""Later!""
[Message 40] Alex: ""Bye!""
[Message 41] River: ""See ya!""
[Message 42] River: ""Guys, Percy just mimicked my laugh! It was so weird!""
[Message 43] Liam: ""Haha! That's hilarious!""
[Message 44] Alex: ""That's actually kind of creepy, River.""
[Message 45] Jordan: ""I'd be freaked out.""
[Message 46] River: ""I am a little freaked out! But also amused.""
[Message 47] Liam: ""Video or it didn't happen!""
[Message 48] River: ""I'll try to get it on video. No promises though. He's shy when the camera's out.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Mittens is always camera-ready. She's such a ham.""
[Message 50] Jordan: ""Mr. Nibbles just ignores the camera.""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Buster tries to eat the camera.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Animals are so funny.""
[Message 53] Liam: ""They really are.""
[Message 54] Jordan: ""Definitely.""
[Message 55] River: ""True.""
[Message 56] Liam: ""Anyone know a good place to get pet supplies around here?""
[Message 57] Alex: ""There's that Pet Paradise on Main Street. It's a bit pricey, but they have a good selection.""
[Message 58] Jordan: ""I usually just order online. It's cheaper.""
[Message 59] River: ""Pet Paradise is good if you need something urgently. Otherwise, online is the way to go.""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Good to know. Thanks!""
[Message 61] Alex: ""No problem!""
[Message 62] Jordan: ""You bet.""
[Message 63] River: ""Sure!""
[Message 64] River: ""Okay, gotta go feed the mimic parrot. Talk later!""
[Message 65] Liam: ""Later!""
[Message 66] Alex: ""Bye!""
[Message 67] Jordan: ""See ya!""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Anyone else's pets have weird sleeping positions?""
[Message 69] Liam: ""Buster sleeps on his back with his legs straight up in the air. It's ridiculous.""
[Message 70] Jordan: ""Mr. Nibbles sleeps in a ball, buried in his bedding.""
[Message 71] River: ""Percy sleeps standing up, clinging to the side of his cage.""
[Message 72] Alex: ""Mittens sleeps curled up on my head. It's cute, but sometimes a little heavy.""
[Message 73] Liam: ""Haha! That's dedication.""
[Message 74] Jordan: ""They're all so different.""
[Message 75] River: ""Totally.""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Speaking of different, has anyone tried those fancy pet food brands?""
[Message 77] Liam: ""I've heard they're good, but also expensive.""
[Message 78] Jordan: ""Mr. Nibbles is happy with his regular hamster food.""
[Message 79] River: ""Percy just eats whatever I eat, pretty much. Which is probably not ideal.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Mittens is a bit of a picky eater. I have to rotate between a few different brands.""
[Message 81] Liam: ""Buster will eat anything. And I mean *anything*.""
[Message 82] Alex: ""Lucky you!""
[Message 83] Liam: ""Not always! He ate my shoe once.""
[Message 84] Alex: ""Oh no!""
[Message 85] Jordan: ""Hamsters don't usually eat shoes...""
[Message 86] River: ""Birds probably wouldn't either, unless they were really bored.""
[Message 87] Liam: ""He was a puppy! He's learned his lesson... mostly.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""Hehe. They're all learning, one way or another.""
[Message 89] Jordan: ""Yeah.""
[Message 90] River: ""True.""
[Message 91] Liam: ""Anyone watching the game tonight?""
[Message 92] Jordan: ""Trying to, but my internet is being spotty.""
[Message 93] Alex: ""I'm more of a documentary person myself.""
[Message 94] River: ""I might catch some of it. Depends on Percy's mood.""
[Message 95] Liam: ""Yeah, Buster will probably just bark at the TV.""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Mittens will probably ignore it.""
[Message 97] Jordan: ""If I can get my internet working, I'll be glued to the screen.""
[Message 98] River: ""Good luck with that!""
[Message 99] Liam: ""Hope your internet cooperates!""
[Message 100] Alex: ""Fingers crossed!""
[Message 101] Jordan: ""Thanks, guys!""
[Message 102] Liam: ""Okay, gotta run some errands. Talk later!""
[Message 103] Alex: ""Bye!""
[Message 104] Jordan: ""See ya!""
[Message 105] River: ""Later!""
[Message 106] River: ""Percy just learned a new word! He said 'hello' to the mailman.""
[Message 107] Liam: ""That's amazing!""
[Message 108] Alex: ""That's so cute!""
[Message 109] Jordan: ""He's getting smarter by the day.""
[Message 110] River: ""I know, right? I'm so proud.""
[Message 111] Liam: ""You should be!""
[Message 112] Alex: ""Definitely!""
[Message 113] Jordan: ""Absolutely!""
[Message 114] Liam: ""Anyone ever tried making their own pet toys?""
[Message 115] Alex: ""I've made a few catnip toys for Mittens. She loves them.""
[Message 116] Jordan: ""I just give Mr. Nibbles cardboard tubes.""
[Message 117] River: ""Percy prefers shiny things. Bottle caps, keys, that kind of stuff.""
[Message 118] Liam: ""I've tried making Buster some rope toys, but he just chews them apart.""
[Message 119] Alex: ""Mittens does that too, eventually.""
[Message 120] Jordan: ""Cardboard tubes are pretty indestructible.""
[Message 121] River: ""Percy doesn't really destroy things, just hoards them.""
[Message 122] Liam: ""Maybe I'll try making him some different kinds of toys.""
[Message 123] Alex: ""Good luck!""
[Message 124] Jordan: ""Have fun!""
[Message 125] River: ""Enjoy!""
[Message 126] River: ""Okay, gotta go. Percy's getting into mischief. Talk later!""
[Message 127] Liam: ""Later!""
[Message 128] Alex: ""Bye!""
[Message 129] Jordan: ""See ya!""
[Message 130] Alex: ""Anyone know of any good hiking trails that allow pets?""
[Message 131] Liam: ""There's the Riverbend Trail. It's pretty dog-friendly.""
[Message 132] Jordan: ""Not much for hamsters, though.""
[Message 133] River: ""Probably not bird-friendly either.""
[Message 134] Alex: ""Good point. Maybe I'll just stick to the park.""
[Message 135] Liam: ""Yeah, the park's always a good option.""
[Message 136] Alex: ""True. Thanks, Liam!""
[Message 137] Liam: ""No problem!""
[Message 138] Liam: ""I'm thinking of planting some flowers in my garden. Any recommendations for pet-safe options?""
[Message 139] Alex: ""Sunflowers are usually a safe bet.""
[Message 140] Jordan: ""Marigolds are supposed to be good too.""
[Message 141] River: ""Just avoid lilies. They're poisonous to cats.""
[Message 142] Liam: ""Good to know! Thanks, everyone!""
[Message 143] Alex: ""You're welcome!""
[Message 144] Jordan: ""Anytime!""
[Message 145] River: ""Sure!""
[Message 146] Alex: ""Well, I'm off to get some groceries. Talk to you all later!""
[Message 147] Liam: ""Have a good trip!""
[Message 148] Jordan: ""See ya!""
[Message 149] River: ""Later!""
[Message 150] Liam: ""Anyone else feeling sleepy? This afternoon slump is hitting hard.""
[Message 151] Jordan: ""Definitely. Coffee time.""
[Message 152] River: ""I'm thinking a nap is in order.""
[Message 153] Liam: ""Yeah, me too. Buster's already snoring.""
[Message 154] Jordan: ""Mr. Nibbles is probably asleep too.""
[Message 155] River: ""Percy's surprisingly active. Maybe he's sensing my exhaustion.""
[Message 156] Liam: ""Animals are weird.""
[Message 157] Jordan: ""True that.""
[Message 158] River: ""Yep.""
[Message 159] Liam: ""Okay, going to take a quick nap. Talk later!""
[Message 160] Jordan: ""Sweet dreams!""
[Message 161] River: ""Sleep tight!""
[Message 162] Liam: ""Thanks!""
[Message 163] River: ""Just found out Percy can say 'Good morning'! He's a chatty bird today.""
[Message 164] Liam: ""He's turning into a regular parrot comedian!""
[Message 165] Jordan: ""Haha, that's great!""
[Message 166] River: ""He really is! Now if only he'd learn to clean his cage...""
[Message 167] Liam: ""That's asking a bit much, isn't it?""
[Message 168] Jordan: ""Definitely.""
[Message 169] River: ""Yeah, probably. A girl can dream, though!""
[Message 170] Liam: ""True. Well, I'm officially signing off for the day. See you all tomorrow!""
[Message 171] Jordan: ""Sounds good. Have a good night!""

395,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone, I'm at the entrance! Anyone else here yet?
[Message 2] River: Just pulled up, Alex! Parking was a nightmare.
[Message 3] Kai: On my way, should be there in 5!
[Message 4] Sam: Almost there too! Traffic is surprisingly light.
[Message 5] Alex: Great! Anyone bring snacks? I forgot to grab something.
[Message 6] River: I’ve got some granola bars! Nothing fancy, but they’ll do.
[Message 7] Kai: Sweet, I'm starving.
[Message 8] Sam: Perfect, I was just thinking about lunch.
[Message 9] Alex: Awesome! So, anyone got any funny pet stories to share while we wait? My cat tried to steal my toast this morning.
[Message 10] River: My dog ate my mom's dentures once. Not my proudest moment explaining that one.
[Message 11] Kai: Oh my god, River! That's hilarious and horrifying.
[Message 12] Sam: My turtle keeps trying to climb out of his tank. He's got this elaborate plan involving rocks.
[Message 13] Alex: A turtle escape artist! I love it!
[Message 14] River: Speaking of animals, did anyone see that documentary about penguins?
[Message 15] Kai: No, but I've heard good things! Which one?
[Message 16] River: March of the Penguins, I think. It's so dramatic!
[Message 17] Sam: I'll have to check it out. I saw a great one about honeybees recently.
[Message 18] Alex: Bees, huh? Interesting. Back to pets, my hamster once built a nest out of all my socks. All of them.
[Message 19] River: OMG, the hamster sock thief!
[Message 20] Kai: My gecko keeps staring at me. It’s unnerving.
[Message 21] Sam: Maybe he's judging your outfit, Kai.
[Message 22] Kai: Probably!
[Message 23] Alex: Haha! Okay, seriously though, does anyone know what time they actually open the doors?
[Message 24] River: Website said 12:30, I think.
[Message 25] Sam: Confirmed. 12:30 is the time.
[Message 26] Kai: Plenty of time for more embarrassing pet stories then!
[Message 27] Alex: True! So, River, spill. More dog denture details!
[Message 28] River: Haha, okay, okay. He literally walked around with them in his mouth, grinning like a cartoon villain.
[Message 29] Sam: I'm picturing it perfectly.
[Message 30] Kai: This is gold!
[Message 31] Alex: My cat also has a thing for plastic bags. He licks them. It's so weird.
[Message 32] River: Cats are just strange. My cat once tried to fight a vacuum cleaner.
[Message 33] Sam: The vacuum is a common enemy, apparently.
[Message 34] Kai: My sister's cat hates water. Like, dramatically hates it.
[Message 35] Alex: All cats hate water, right? It's a universal truth.
[Message 36] River: I think so.
[Message 37] Sam: Pretty much.
[Message 38] Kai: Definitely.
[Message 39] Alex: Okay, quick change of subject - anyone else have a teacher-student conference coming up?
[Message 40] River: Ugh, yes. Dreading it.
[Message 41] Sam: Me too. My kid isn't exactly acing everything.
[Message 42] Kai: I remember those days...good luck, y'all.
[Message 43] Alex: Thanks! Hoping for the best, preparing for the worst. Back to pets, my neighbor's parrot swears. Like, a lot.
[Message 44] River: Oh wow. That's... a talent.
[Message 45] Sam: I would pay to hear that.
[Message 46] Kai: Record it and send it to us!
[Message 47] Alex: I wish I could! I'm pretty sure my neighbor would kill me.
[Message 48] River: Fair enough. What's your kid struggling with, Sam? Maybe we can brainstorm.
[Message 49] Sam: Math. It's always math.
[Message 50] Kai: Math is the devil.
[Message 51] Alex: I can relate. Mine struggles with history. So much memorization!
[Message 52] River: Maybe try flashcards? Or those mnemonic devices?
[Message 53] Sam: We've tried flashcards. He eats them.
[Message 54] Kai: Eats them?!
[Message 55] Alex: Well, that's one way to remember them, I guess.
[Message 56] River: Okay, new plan needed. Maybe try connecting history to something he's interested in?
[Message 57] Sam: He likes video games... history video games?
[Message 58] Kai: There are some! Assassin's Creed?
[Message 59] Alex: Great idea, Kai!
[Message 60] River: Worth a shot!
[Message 61] Sam: I'll look into that. Thanks, guys!
[Message 62] Alex: No problem! We're here to help... and share embarrassing pet stories.
[Message 63] River: Always! Okay, my hamster once escaped and got stuck in a Pringles can.
[Message 64] Sam: Oh my god, River! You have the best pet stories.
[Message 65] Kai: I’m dying! A Pringles can?!
[Message 66] Alex: That's amazing!
[Message 67] River: It was not amazing at the time, I assure you. Trying to get him out without hurting him…
[Message 68] Sam: I can imagine!
[Message 69] Alex: Anyone else noticing the line is starting to form?
[Message 70] River: Yeah, I see it. Should we head over?
[Message 71] Kai: Let's do it!
[Message 72] Sam: Agreed. Pringle-loving hamsters aside, let's get in line.
[Message 73] Alex: On our way! See you guys at the entrance.
[Message 74] River: See ya!
[Message 75] Kai: Be there in a sec!
[Message 76] Sam: Coming!
[Message 77] Alex: This is gonna be awesome!
[Message 78] River: Definitely!
[Message 79] Kai: Excited!
[Message 80] Sam: Me too!
[Message 81] Alex: Did anyone check the weather for tomorrow’s hike?
[Message 82] River: Oh shoot, no!
[Message 83] Kai: I can check! Give me one sec.
[Message 84] Sam: I think I heard it's supposed to be sunny.
[Message 85] Alex: Fingers crossed!
[Message 86] River: A sunny hike would be perfect!
[Message 87] Kai: Confirmed! Sunny and 70.
[Message 88] Alex: Woohoo!
[Message 89] River: Excellent!
[Message 90] Sam: Perfect hiking weather!
[Message 91] Kai: Alright!
[Message 92] Alex: This is the best day ever!
[Message 93] River: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves! But I agree, it's shaping up nicely.
[Message 94] Sam: Haha, true! One thing at a time.

396,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Ugh, finally getting gas. This evening light is pretty though.""
[Message 2] Jamie: ""Tell me about it! Been running around all day. Gas prices are still crazy, right?""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Seriously! I swear they went up five cents since yesterday.""
[Message 4] Jamie: ""Feels like it. So, anything exciting happening this week?""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Actually, yeah! There's that networking event downtown. The one about career development.""
[Message 6] Jamie: ""Oh, right! The one at the old library?""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Yep, that's the one. Thinking of checking it out.""
[Message 8] Jamie: ""Hmm, might be interesting. I've been meaning to expand my professional circle.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Exactly! Plus, free snacks, probably.""
[Message 10] Jamie: ""Haha, always a good perk.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""For real. What about you? Any big plans?""
[Message 12] Jamie: ""Nothing too wild. Just finishing up this big project at work. Then, hopefully, some relaxation.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Deserved! Construction work is no joke.""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""It's definitely rewarding, but exhausting. Speaking of exhausting, did you see that lunar eclipse last night?""
[Message 15] Alex: ""No way! I totally missed it. Was it cool?""
[Message 16] Jamie: ""It was amazing! Wish I had a better camera.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Dang, I'll have to check out some pictures online. Remind me to set an alarm for the next one.""
[Message 18] Jamie: ""Will do. Back to the networking thing - are you going alone?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Probably. Unless I can convince my roommate to come. He's pretty introverted though.""
[Message 20] Jamie: ""Ah, I get that. I might drag a friend along for moral support.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Good plan! Makes it less intimidating.""
[Message 22] Jamie: ""Definitely. So, what are you hoping to get out of the event?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Mostly just meeting new people in my field, maybe finding some new career paths I hadn't considered.""
[Message 24] Jamie: ""That's a smart goal. I'm looking to learn about new technologies and sustainable building practices.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Very cool! Fort Wayne could definitely use more green building.""
[Message 26] Jamie: ""Totally agree. Okay, gas is done. Gotta run. Maybe I'll see you at the networking thing?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Sounds good! Drive safe!""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""You too!""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Okay, back to thinking about what to wear to this thing...""
[Message 30] Jamie: ""Ugh, decisions, decisions.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Seriously. Business casual is such a vague term.""
[Message 32] Jamie: ""Right? Like, can I wear jeans or not?""
[Message 33] Alex: ""I'm thinking dark jeans and a blazer. Play it safe.""
[Message 34] Jamie: ""Solid choice. I might go with some comfortable pants and a nice top.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Comfort is key! Especially if you're standing around for a while.""
[Message 36] Jamie: ""Exactly. Hey, have you tried that new coffee shop on Main Street?""
[Message 37] Alex: ""No, I haven't! Is it any good?""
[Message 38] Jamie: ""It's amazing! They have the best lattes. You should check it out.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""I definitely will! Thanks for the recommendation.""
[Message 40] Jamie: ""No problem! Okay, seriously gotta go. Talk soon!""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Bye!""
[Message 42] Alex: ""Okay, back to the outfit dilemma. Maybe a dress? Nah, too formal.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Okay, dark jeans it is. Now, which blazer...""
[Message 44] Alex: ""This is way more stressful than it needs to be.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""I should probably practice my elevator pitch, too.""
[Message 46] Alex: ""What do I even say? 'Hi, I'm Alex, I'm a pharmacist...' Boring.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Maybe something about my passion for helping people? Nah, too cheesy.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""Okay, new plan. I'll just wing it. Works every time... sort of.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""I should probably eat something before I go, too. Networking on an empty stomach is a recipe for disaster.""
[Message 50] Alex: ""Hmm, what to make? Pasta? Pizza? Salad? So many options.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Okay, pasta it is. Quick and easy.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""And maybe a glass of wine to calm the nerves.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Just one glass. Gotta stay professional.""
[Message 54] Alex: ""Okay, pasta is cooking. Time to relax for a few minutes.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Maybe I'll practice my guitar. Haven't played in a while.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""Okay, a little guitar session it is.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""(guitar noises)""
[Message 58] Alex: ""Still got it! Sort of.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Okay, back to reality. Gotta get ready.""
[Message 60] Alex: ""Pasta is ready! Time to eat.""
[Message 61] Alex: ""(eating noises)""
[Message 62] Alex: ""Okay, that was delicious. Now, getting ready time!""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Shower time! Finally.""
[Message 64] Alex: ""(shower noises)""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Okay, feeling refreshed! Now, the outfit...""
[Message 66] Alex: ""Dark jeans, blazer, check. Nice top, check. Shoes...""
[Message 67] Alex: ""Boots or flats? Boots are more stylish, but flats are more comfortable.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Flats it is. Comfort wins.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Okay, almost ready! Just need to do my hair and makeup.""
[Message 70] Alex: ""A little bit of makeup, nothing too crazy.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Hair up or down? Down, definitely.""
[Message 72] Alex: ""Okay, I think I'm finally ready! Wish me luck!""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Time to head out the door. Wish me luck!""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Okay, on my way! Traffic is surprisingly light.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""Almost there! Feeling a little nervous, but mostly excited.""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Parking is going to be a nightmare, I just know it.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Yep, found a spot about a mile away. Great.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""Okay, time for a little walk. At least it's a nice evening.""
[Message 79] Alex: ""Almost there! Can see the building now.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Okay, inside! Wish me luck!""
[Message 81] Alex: ""It's actually pretty crowded. Good sign!""
[Message 82] Alex: ""Okay, gotta find the registration table.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Found it! Getting my name tag now.""
[Message 84] Alex: ""Name tag acquired! Now what?""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Okay, time to mingle. Deep breaths.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Saw someone spill their drink already. Yikes.""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Spotted the snack table! Priorities.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""Okay, grabbing a snack. These mini quiches look good.""
[Message 89] Alex: ""Okay, snack acquired. Now to find someone to talk to.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""Okay, approaching a group of people. Wish me luck!""

[Message 92] Alex: ""Great, someone's actually talking to me!""
[Message 93] Alex: ""They seem nice, thank goodness.""
[Message 94] Alex: ""We're talking about the changes in the pharmaceutical industry. Interesting!""
[Message 95] Alex: ""Making small talk, check!""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Okay, feeling a little more comfortable now.""
[Message 97] Alex: ""This is actually going pretty well!""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Got a business card! Progress!""
[Message 99] Alex: ""Time for another snack. Networking is hard work.""
[Message 100] Alex: ""Saw Jamie! Should I say hi?""
[Message 101] Alex: ""Nah, she looks busy. Maybe later.""

[Message 143] Jamie: ""Just finished up that big project at the construction site. So relieved!""
[Message 144] Alex: ""I bet! That must have been exhausting.""
[Message 145] Jamie: ""It was! But also really rewarding. Seeing something you built come to life is pretty cool.""
[Message 146] Alex: ""I can imagine! What's next on the agenda?""
[Message 147] Jamie: ""Thinking of taking a short trip somewhere. Maybe to see some different architecture.""
[Message 148] Alex: ""That sounds amazing! Where are you thinking of going?""
[Message 149] Jamie: ""Not sure yet. Maybe Chicago? Or Detroit? Lots of cool buildings there.""
[Message 150] Alex: ""Definitely! I've always wanted to go to Chicago.""
[Message 151] Jamie: ""We should go together sometime!""
[Message 152] Alex: ""That would be so fun!""
[Message 153] Jamie: ""Okay, let's actually plan that! After this event.""
[Message 154] Alex: ""Deal! Okay, back to networking.""
[Message 155] Jamie: ""Agreed. Let's make the most of this.""
[Message 156] Alex: ""So, who have you met so far?""
[Message 157] Jamie: ""Met a guy who's working on developing sustainable building materials. Really interesting stuff.""
[Message 158] Alex: ""Wow! That's right up your alley.""
[Message 159] Jamie: ""Totally! Okay, let's go mingle. Stick together?""
[Message 160] Alex: ""Sounds like a plan! Let's do this.""
[Message 161] Alex: ""Okay, approaching another group of people.""
[Message 162] Jamie: ""Wish us luck!""
[Message 163] Alex: ""Here we go!""
[Message 164] Alex: ""Excuse me, is anyone using this table?""
[Message 165] Jamie: ""Making small talk now.""
[Message 166] Alex: ""This is actually going pretty smoothly.""
[Message 167] Jamie: ""Feeling good about this connection.""
[Message 168] Alex: ""Okay, this is great!""
[Message 169] Jamie: ""So glad we came.""
[Message 170] Alex: ""Me too! This was definitely worth it.""
[Message 171] Jamie: ""Time to exchange business cards.""
[Message 172] Alex: ""Okay, adding this person to my LinkedIn.""
[Message 173] Jamie: ""Same here. Good connection.""
[Message 174] Alex: ""Okay, feeling accomplished!""
[Message 175] Jamie: ""Yeah, feeling like we actually networked successfully.""
[Message 176] Alex: ""Time for one last snack before we head out.""
[Message 177] Jamie: ""Agreed! Let's grab some more of those mini quiches.""

397,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone, quick check-in. How are we feeling about the upcoming presentation on financial literacy for high school students?

[Message 2] Jordan: I'm feeling pretty good, Alex! I've got some engaging slides ready. How about you, Chris?

[Message 3] Chris: A little nervous, honestly. High schoolers can be a tough crowd.

[Message 4] Alex: I hear you, Chris. But remember, we're just trying to plant a seed. Any little bit helps.

[Message 5] Jordan: Exactly! I'm focusing on making it relatable. Real-world examples, you know?

[Message 6] Chris: I like that. Maybe I'll add some pop culture references to keep them engaged.

[Message 7] Alex: Good idea, Chris! That could work well. Anyone need anything from the coffee shop downstairs? I'm heading there now.

[Message 8] Jordan: Ooh, can you grab me a latte, Alex? Thanks!

[Message 9] Chris: Just water for me, please. Thanks!

[Message 10] Alex: Got it. Be back in a few.

[Message 11] Jordan: While Alex is gone, Chris, what specifically are you nervous about? Maybe we can brainstorm some solutions.

[Message 12] Chris: Just worried about losing their attention. And making it sound too preachy.

[Message 13] Jordan: Definitely avoid the preachy tone. Think more like, ""This is how you can afford that cool new phone/car/whatever when you're older.""

[Message 14] Chris: That's a good angle. I'll work on framing it that way.

[Message 15] Jordan: Another thing - visuals are key! Make sure your slides are engaging and not just walls of text.

[Message 16] Chris: Noted! I'll ditch some of the extra paragraphs.

[Message 17] Alex: Back with caffeine! Here you go, Jordan. And water for you, Chris.

[Message 18] Jordan: Thanks, Alex! You're a lifesaver.

[Message 19] Chris: Appreciate it, Alex!

[Message 20] Alex: No problem! So, back to the presentation, how are we dividing up the sections?

[Message 21] Jordan: I was thinking I could cover budgeting and saving.

[Message 22] Chris: I can handle investing basics and the importance of credit scores.

[Message 23] Alex: Sounds good. I can do a general introduction and wrap-up, emphasizing the long-term benefits of financial literacy.

[Message 24] Jordan: Perfect! Let's run through it once more tomorrow morning to make sure everything flows smoothly.

[Message 25] Chris: Agreed. I'll incorporate some of the tips you gave me, Jordan.

[Message 26] Alex: Great! I think we're in good shape. By the way, anyone watching that new baking show on Netflix?

[Message 27] Jordan: Oh, I am! It's so addictive! Those cakes are insane.

[Message 28] Chris: Haven't had time lately, but I've heard good things.

[Message 29] Alex: It's a good stress reliever. Anyway, back to financial literacy... let's talk about Q&A.

[Message 30] Jordan: Good point. We should anticipate some common questions.

[Message 31] Chris: Like, ""How do I save money when I have no money?""

[Message 32] Alex: Exactly. Or, ""Why should I care about this now?""

[Message 33] Jordan: I think honesty is the best approach. Acknowledge their challenges, but emphasize the power of starting small.

[Message 34] Chris: I like that. Being relatable is key.

[Message 35] Alex: Agreed. Maybe we can share some personal anecdotes about our own financial struggles when we were younger.

[Message 36] Jordan: That could be powerful. It shows we understand their perspective.

[Message 37] Chris: Okay, I'm starting to feel a little better about this presentation.

[Message 38] Alex: See? We've got this! Just remember to breathe and be yourself.

[Message 39] Jordan: Totally! We're a great team.

[Message 40] Alex: So, moving on to visuals... any suggestions for making the slides more engaging? I was thinking maybe some infographics?

[Message 41] Jordan: Infographics are always a good idea! And maybe some short video clips?

[Message 42] Chris: Video clips could work. Maybe some snippets from financial news or interviews?

[Message 43] Alex: Good idea! I'll see what I can find.

[Message 44] Jordan: Okay, I need to step away for a quick phone call. Be back in a few minutes.

[Message 45] Alex: No problem. We'll be here.

[Message 46] Chris: I'm just going to review my section of the presentation.

[Message 47] Alex: Sounds good. I'll keep brainstorming ideas for the visuals.

[Message 48] Chris: Hey Alex, quick question. Do you think it's worth mentioning different types of investments, like stocks and bonds?

[Message 49] Alex: I think it's important to at least introduce the concepts, but keep it simple. Don't get too bogged down in the details.

[Message 50] Chris: Okay, I'll just give a brief overview.

[Message 51] Alex: That sounds perfect. We don't want to overwhelm them.

[Message 52] Jordan: Back! Sorry about that.

[Message 53] Alex: No worries. We were just discussing the level of detail to include about investments.

[Message 54] Jordan: Ah, good topic. I agree with Alex, keep it high-level.

[Message 55] Chris: Yep, that's the plan.

[Message 56] Alex: So, any other burning questions or concerns?

[Message 57] Jordan: I think we've covered everything pretty well.

[Message 58] Chris: I'm feeling much more prepared now. Thanks, guys!

[Message 59] Alex: Anytime! We're in this together.

[Message 60] Jordan: Absolutely! Teamwork makes the dream work.

[Message 61] Alex: Speaking of dreams, I had the weirdest dream last night… involving a giant spreadsheet and a talking dog.

[Message 62] Jordan: Haha! That sounds… interesting.

[Message 63] Chris: I'd pay to see that movie.

[Message 64] Alex: Seriously! It was bizarre. But anyway, back to reality… let's schedule a final run-through for tomorrow morning.

[Message 65] Jordan: I'm free anytime before noon.

[Message 66] Chris: Same here.

[Message 67] Alex: Okay, how about 10 AM?

[Message 68] Jordan: Perfect.

[Message 69] Chris: Works for me.

[Message 70] Alex: Awesome! Marked it on the calendar.

[Message 71] Jordan: Great! I'm going to grab another coffee. Anyone want anything?

[Message 72] Chris: I'm good, thanks!

[Message 73] Alex: I'm okay too. Thanks, Jordan!

[Message 74] Jordan: Alright, be back in a flash!

[Message 75] Alex: So, Chris, how's that sculpting coming along?

[Message 76] Chris: It's slow going, but I'm making progress. Trying to capture the essence of a river.

[Message 77] Alex: Wow, that sounds challenging!

[Message 78] Chris: It is! But I'm enjoying the process.

[Message 79] Alex: That's what matters. It's important to have hobbies that help you unwind.

[Message 80] Chris: Agreed! It's a good way to de-stress after a long day.

[Message 81] Jordan: Back with caffeine! What are you guys chatting about?

[Message 82] Alex: Chris was telling me about his sculpting project.

[Message 83] Jordan: Oh, cool! What are you working on now, Chris?

[Message 84] Chris: A sculpture of a river.

[Message 85] Jordan: That sounds beautiful!

[Message 86] Alex: It really does. Anyway, we should probably get back to the presentation prep.

[Message 87] Jordan: Right, right. Focus.

[Message 88] Chris: Okay, let's do it.

[Message 89] Alex: One last thing - should we bring any handouts for the students?

[Message 90] Jordan: I think that's a great idea! Something with key takeaways and resources.

[Message 91] Chris: Definitely! Maybe a list of websites and apps that can help them manage their money.

[Message 92] Alex: Perfect! I can put something together.

[Message 93] Jordan: Awesome! You're the best, Alex!

[Message 94] Alex: Just trying to be helpful. So, I think we're all set for tomorrow's run-through.

[Message 95] Jordan: Yep, I think so too.

[Message 96] Chris: Looking forward to it.

[Message 97] Alex: Great! Let's all get a good night's sleep.

[Message 98] Jordan: Will do!

[Message 99] Chris: You too!

[Message 100] Alex: Okay, I'm going to head out. See you all tomorrow!

[Message 101] Jordan: Bye, Alex!

[Message 102] Chris: See ya!

[Message 103] Jordan: I think we are very prepared, now, time to check that new store in Utica Square.

[Message 104] Chris: Agreed. I will be heading to see my family, have a wonderful time shopping!

[Message 105] Jordan: Thank you Chris! You too.
[Message 106] Jordan: Did I ever show you that new bag I brought back from NYC.

[Message 107] Chris: No! I would love to see it.

[Message 108] Jordan: It is a Rebecca Minkoff number. The leather is incredible.
[Message 109] Chris: You are an amazing fashionista. I need to steal some of your style.

[Message 110] Jordan: I have some many clothes, I would happy to give some away!
[Message 111] Chris: That is so kind of you!

[Message 112] Jordan: I will bring them by next week and you can take a look.
[Message 113] Chris: Thank you! I really appreciate it.
[Message 114] Jordan: No problem!

[Message 115] Chris: OK I must leave now, it was great chatting with you today.",0,

399,"[Message 1] Alex: Good morning everyone! Beautiful day for some hoops. Anyone thinking about summer travel plans yet?
[Message 2] Ben: Morning Alex! I am. Trying to decide between a beach vacation and visiting family back east.
[Message 3] Casey: Morning! Beach sounds amazing, Ben. I'm thinking of a trip to Europe, maybe Italy.
[Message 4] Dana: Morning all. Europe sounds expensive, Casey! I'm leaning towards a staycation this year.
[Message 5] Ethan: Morning team! I haven't even thought about travel yet. Too busy with work.
[Message 6] Alex: Staycation could be nice, Dana. Save some money and explore local gems.
[Message 7] Ben: True, Alex. We have some amazing state parks around here.
[Message 8] Casey: Italy is a bit of a splurge, but I've been saving for ages. Dream destination!
[Message 9] Dana: That’s fair, Casey. You deserve it! Any specific regions you're looking at?
[Message 10] Ethan: Work has been crazy. Just trying to keep my head above water.
[Message 11] Alex: Ethan, remember to take some time for yourself! Burnout is real.
[Message 12] Ben: Yeah, Ethan! We’re all here for you if you need to vent.
[Message 13] Casey: Definitely, Ethan. Even a short getaway can do wonders.
[Message 14] Dana: Agreed, Ethan. Self-care is important.
[Message 15] Ethan: Thanks, everyone. Appreciate that. Maybe a weekend trip somewhere.
[Message 16] Alex: That's the spirit! Napa Valley is always a good option.
[Message 17] Ben: Or even just a day trip down to Monterey!
[Message 18] Casey: Speaking of weekend trips, anyone been to Yosemite recently?
[Message 19] Dana: I haven’t, but I’ve heard it’s packed.
[Message 20] Ethan: Yosemite is beautiful, but definitely crowded. Plan ahead.
[Message 21] Alex: Has anyone tried the new food truck that opened up downtown? Heard good things.
[Message 22] Ben: No, Alex, but I'm always up for trying new food. What kind is it?
[Message 23] Casey: I saw it! I think it's gourmet tacos.
[Message 24] Dana: Gourmet tacos sound amazing! We should all try it sometime.
[Message 25] Ethan: I’m in! Tacos are always a good idea.
[Message 26] Alex: Okay, taco lunch date next week? We can coordinate.
[Message 27] Ben: Sounds good, Alex. I'm flexible.
[Message 28] Casey: I'm free Tuesday or Wednesday.
[Message 29] Dana: Count me in too.
[Message 30] Ethan: I can do Wednesday.
[Message 31] Alex: Wednesday it is! Back to travel, Casey, what part of Italy are you thinking?
[Message 32] Ben: Yeah, details, Casey! I want to live vicariously through you.
[Message 33] Casey: I'm thinking Rome, Florence, and maybe the Amalfi Coast. Classic, I know.
[Message 34] Dana: The Amalfi Coast looks stunning in pictures.
[Message 35] Ethan: I've heard amazing things about Florence. Art and history everywhere.
[Message 36] Alex: Florence is incredible. Definitely make time for the Uffizi Gallery.
[Message 37] Ben: Rome is on my bucket list. The Colosseum and the Vatican!
[Message 38] Casey: Exactly, Ben! History and beauty.
[Message 39] Dana: I’m more of a nature person. Give me mountains or beaches any day.
[Message 40] Ethan: Mountains are definitely my happy place. Hiking and fresh air.
[Message 41] Alex: Have you guys seen the new trail they opened up in Marin?
[Message 42] Ben: No, Alex! Tell me more.
[Message 43] Casey: I'm interested too!
[Message 44] Dana: I might actually be tempted to go for a hike.
[Message 45] Ethan: Sounds good. Maybe we can do a group hike sometime.
[Message 46] Alex: It's called the Redwood Creek Trail. Beautiful redwoods, pretty easy hike.
[Message 47] Ben: Redwood Creek Trail, noted! Thanks, Alex.
[Message 48] Casey: Perfect! Thanks for the recommendation.
[Message 49] Dana: I'll look it up.
[Message 50] Ethan: I'll check it out too.
[Message 51] Alex: So, back to the beach versus family trip, Ben...what's winning?
[Message 52] Ben: Tough call, Alex. The kids want the beach, but I haven't seen my sister in ages.
[Message 53] Casey: Could you combine the two somehow?
[Message 54] Dana: Maybe a beach vacation near your sister?
[Message 55] Ethan: That's a good idea, Dana!
[Message 56] Alex: Exactly! Compromise is key.
[Message 57] Ben: Hmmm, that's a thought. I'll have to look into that.
[Message 58] Casey: Worth exploring!
[Message 59] Dana: Let us know what you decide!
[Message 60] Ethan: Good luck with the planning!
[Message 61] Alex: Did anyone catch the Warriors game last night?
[Message 62] Ben: I did! What a nail-biter!
[Message 63] Casey: I missed it. Was it good?
[Message 64] Dana: I watched a bit of it. Pretty intense.
[Message 65] Ethan: I was working. Ugh.
[Message 66] Alex: Super close! They pulled it out at the last second.
[Message 67] Ben: Steph Curry was on fire!
[Message 68] Casey: Maybe I'll catch the replay.
[Message 69] Dana: I'm more of a Giants fan myself.
[Message 70] Ethan: I haven't been following sports much lately.
[Message 71] Alex: Fair enough, Dana. To each their own.
[Message 72] Ben: Giants are doing okay this season, right?
[Message 73] Casey: I think they're holding their own.
[Message 74] Dana: They have their moments.
[Message 75] Ethan: So, Wednesday for the tacos? Still on?
[Message 76] Alex: Yes, Ethan! Wednesday it is. I'll text everyone the address of the food truck.
[Message 77] Ben: Awesome!
[Message 78] Casey: Great!
[Message 79] Dana: Looking forward to it.
[Message 80] Ethan: Perfect.
[Message 81] Alex: Any big family dinners coming up for anyone?
[Message 82] Ben: We're having a big one for my grandson's birthday next month.
[Message 83] Casey: Oh, that's nice!
[Message 84] Dana: That sounds fun.
[Message 85] Ethan: My family usually does something for Thanksgiving.
[Message 86] Alex: We're having a small get-together for my partner's birthday soon.
[Message 87] Ben: Grandson is turning 5. Time flies!

[Message 89] Dana: They grow up so fast.
[Message 90] Ethan: Thanksgiving is always a chaotic but fun time.
[Message 91] Alex: What are you planning for your partner's birthday, Alex?
[Message 92] Ben: Yeah, what's the plan, Alex?
[Message 93] Casey: I'm curious too!
[Message 94] Dana: Spill the beans!
[Message 95] Ethan: Birthday secrets!
[Message 96] Alex: Just a quiet dinner at their favorite restaurant. Nothing too extravagant.
[Message 97] Ben: Simple and sweet. I like it.
[Message 98] Casey: A classic choice.
[Message 99] Dana: Sometimes the simple things are the best.
[Message 100] Ethan: Sounds lovely.
[Message 101] Alex: It's their favorite Italian place, so they'll be happy.
[Message 102] Ben: Ah, perfect choice, Casey!
[Message 103] Casey: Italy is always a good idea! See, travel wins again.
[Message 104] Dana: Everything comes back to Italy somehow.
[Message 105] Ethan: Maybe I should learn Italian.
[Message 106] Alex: Never too late to learn a new language, Ethan!
[Message 107] Ben: I tried learning Spanish once. Didn't go so well.
[Message 108] Casey: I'm trying to learn French on Duolingo.
[Message 109] Dana: I always wanted to learn sign language.
[Message 110] Ethan: Duolingo is great!
[Message 111] Alex: My partner speaks fluent Spanish. It's impressive.
[Message 112] Ben: My grandkids are learning Mandarin in school.
[Message 113] Casey: That's amazing!
[Message 114] Dana: So many languages to choose from!
[Message 115] Ethan: Maybe I'll start with a simple phrase book.
[Message 116] Alex: That's a good starting point, Ethan.
[Message 117] Ben: Well, I'm starting to get hungry.
[Message 118] Casey: Me too!
[Message 119] Dana: Same here.
[Message 120] Ethan: Tacos on Wednesday can't come soon enough.
[Message 121] Alex: Speaking of food, has anyone tried making their own pasta?
[Message 122] Ben: I haven't, but I've always wanted to.
[Message 123] Casey: It's on my culinary bucket list.
[Message 124] Dana: Seems intimidating.
[Message 125] Ethan: I'm not much of a cook.
[Message 126] Alex: It's actually not that hard, just takes some practice.
[Message 127] Ben: Maybe I'll watch some YouTube tutorials.
[Message 128] Casey: Good idea, Ben!
[Message 129] Dana: Let me know if you find any good ones.
[Message 130] Ethan: I'll stick to ordering takeout.
[Message 131] Alex: Fair enough, Ethan!
[Message 132] Ben: Well, I should probably head home and get some breakfast.
[Message 133] Casey: Me too.
[Message 134] Dana: Agreed.
[Message 135] Ethan: See you all on Wednesday!
[Message 136] Alex: See you Wednesday for tacos! Drive safe everyone.
[Message 137] Ben: You too, Alex.
[Message 138] Casey: Bye everyone!
[Message 139] Dana: Take care!
[Message 140] Ethan: Later!
[Message 141] Alex: Quick question, anyone know a good place to get luggage repaired? One of my wheels broke.
[Message 142] Ben: I think there's a shoe repair shop on Clement Street that also does luggage.
[Message 143] Casey: I've used them before, Ben's right. Good work.
[Message 144] Dana: Good to know!
[Message 145] Ethan: Never had to repair luggage. I'm usually pretty gentle.
[Message 146] Alex: Clement Street, got it! Thanks, Ben and Casey!
[Message 147] Ben: No problem, Alex!
[Message 148] Casey: Happy to help!
[Message 149] Dana: Learning so much today!
[Message 150] Ethan: Always something new.
[Message 151] Alex: Alright, seriously heading out now. Have a great day everyone!

400,"[Message 1] Daniel: Hey guys, heard about what happened at the Doctor's Office? Crazy.

[Message 2] Marcus: Yeah, that security guard, Right? Awful. I used to see him all the time.

[Message 3] Zara: Unbelievable. Sunrise, too? That's when I usually walk my dog.

[Message 4] Daniel: Scary stuff. You okay, Zara?

[Message 5] Zara: Yeah, shaken up, but fine. Thanks, Daniel.

[Message 6] Marcus: Anyone know any details?

[Message 7] Daniel: Just what I saw on the news. Something about blunt force trauma.

[Message 8] Zara: Ugh, that's horrible.

[Message 9] Marcus: I heard whispers it was about some business deal gone wrong. People are saying.

[Message 10] Daniel: You hear everything, Marcus!

[Message 11] Marcus: Just saying what I heard. Anyway, Zara you are not safe walking.

[Message 12] Zara: I appreciate the concern, Marcus, I will walk with Pepper spray from now on.

[Message 13] Daniel: Stay safe guys

[Message 14] Marcus: I need to check out the location to see what happened.

[Message 15] Zara: Okay...be careful.

[Message 16] Daniel: Weird, Marcus. Why you need to go to the murder scene.

[Message 17] Marcus: I just want to understand what happened.

[Message 18] Zara: Ok.

[Message 19] Daniel: I feel bad for the family of the 2.  Security Guard

[Message 20] Marcus: Yeah, a sad situation indeed.

[Message 21] Zara: Does anyone knows the 2.  Security Guard's name?

[Message 22] Marcus: I think his name was James.

[Message 23] Daniel: Yeah, James. He always seemed a bit on edge, though.

[Message 24] Zara: Really? I never noticed.

[Message 25] Marcus: Maybe he was just anxious. It's a tough job.

[Message 26] Daniel: True. Anyway, anyone up for a movie tonight? Need a distraction.

[Message 27] Zara: Sounds good, Daniel. What are you thinking?

[Message 28] Marcus: Count me in too. Anything not horror.

[Message 29] Daniel: Agreed, no horror.

[Message 30] Zara: Perfect!

[Message 31] Daniel: Ok let me find a good movie.

[Message 32] Marcus: Did you hear that crazy preacher, Elijah, ranting about James a few weeks ago?

[Message 33] Zara: No! What did he say?

[Message 34] Daniel: Something about James being an abomination. Elijah's always saying crazy stuff.

[Message 35] Marcus: Yeah, but could be something.

[Message 36] Zara: That's awful.

[Message 37] Daniel: Agreed.

[Message 38] Marcus: Elijah always hated James. Mens Rea right there.

[Message 39] Zara: Where did you hear that Marcus?

[Message 40] Marcus: From sources

[Message 41] Daniel: Ok Marcus. You sounds like the cops right now.

[Message 42] Marcus: No, I don't.

[Message 43] Zara: I need to order some coffee.

[Message 44] Daniel: You good Zara?

[Message 45] Zara: Yes, I am just bored.

[Message 46] Marcus: What if it was that kid, Alex, always hanging around James? Heard they had a fight.

[Message 47] Zara: Alex? Really?

[Message 48] Daniel: Alex is just a kid.

[Message 49] Marcus: A kid with anger issues. Maybe he intended to hurt James.

[Message 50] Zara: I haven't seen him in awhile

[Message 51] Daniel: Leave Alex alone Marcus

[Message 52] Marcus: Whatever. I need a beer.

[Message 53] Zara: Me too.

[Message 54] Daniel: I need a nap

[Message 55] Marcus: Did you guys see that strange guy, Kai, with the accent arguing with James last week?

[Message 56] Zara: No, I didn't. Where?

[Message 57] Daniel: No, never seen them

[Message 58] Marcus: In front of the Doctor's Office. Kai seemed really angry. Maybe shouted something that provoke him.

[Message 59] Zara: Maybe he did.

[Message 60] Daniel: That's not right Marcus.

[Message 61] Marcus: I'm just saying what I saw. I need to check what they have on cctv.

[Message 62] Zara: Why?

[Message 63] Daniel: Marcus, you are being weird.

[Message 64] Marcus: Leave me alone Daniel.

[Message 65] Zara: Stop it guys

[Message 66] Marcus: It's just that if James had called 911, he would be still alive.

[Message 67] Daniel: What are you talking about?

[Message 68] Zara: Exactly

[Message 69] Marcus: Forget it. I said too much.

[Message 70] Daniel: Exactly what is that?

[Message 71] Zara: Ok!

[Message 72] Marcus: Pizza tonight?

[Message 73] Daniel: Sure.

[Message 74] Zara: I will pass, thanks.

[Message 75] Marcus: Why?

[Message 76] Zara: I have a headache.

[Message 77] Daniel: Okay, feel better.

[Message 78] Marcus: Get some rest

[Message 79] Zara: Thank you!

[Message 80] Marcus: They're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 81] Daniel: Hopefully.

[Message 82] Zara: Indeed.

[Message 83] Marcus: What movie should we see tonight?

[Message 84] Daniel: Still finding some

[Message 85] Zara: Let me know when you figure it out.

[Message 86] Marcus: I will

[Message 87] Daniel: Ok.

[Message 88] Zara: I need to go to the store.

[Message 89] Marcus: What do you need from the store?

[Message 90] Daniel: Water.

[Message 91] Zara: Coffee.

[Message 92] Marcus: Okay.

[Message 93] Daniel: I think the police will find him sooner or later.

[Message 94] Marcus: I am sure they will.

[Message 95] Zara: Lets hope so.

[Message 96] Marcus: Ok guys I will pick up the pizza later.

[Message 97] Daniel: Okay.

[Message 98] Zara: Have fun.

[Message 99] Marcus: They should check Elijah's alibi. He was talking about hurting James right before.

[Message 100] Daniel: I would be very surprised.

[Message 101] Zara: Me too.

[Message 102] Marcus: People are capable of everything.

[Message 103] Daniel: True.

[Message 104] Zara: Unfortunately.

[Message 105] Marcus: I need to go.

[Message 106] Daniel: Where are you going?

[Message 107] Zara: Take care.

[Message 108] Marcus: Bye.

[Message 109] Daniel: Okay.

[Message 110] Zara: Bye.

[Message 111] Daniel: Why you asked where he was going?

[Message 112] Zara: Just curious. He's acting weird.

[Message 113] Daniel: I agree, he is really acting weird.

[Message 114] Zara: I need to find my umbrella.

[Message 115] Daniel: Any ideas what is going on with him?

[Message 116] Zara: Not at all.

[Message 117] Daniel: He seems very curious about the case.

[Message 118] Zara: Exactly, that is what I am thinking

[Message 119] Daniel: Maybe he is trying to help?

[Message 120] Zara: Maybe...but it doesn't seem like it.

[Message 121] Daniel: That is what I think.

[Message 122] Zara: I am worried.

[Message 123] Daniel: Me too.

[Message 124] Zara: Should we tell the police?

[Message 125] Daniel: I don't know...what if we are wrong?

[Message 126] Zara: Exactly!

[Message 127] Daniel: Let's wait a bit.

[Message 128] Zara: I agree.

[Message 129] Daniel: Ok.

[Message 130] Zara: What time is the movie tonight?

[Message 131] Daniel: 8 PM

[Message 132] Zara: Ok!

[Message 133] Daniel: I will pick you up.

[Message 134] Zara: Okay perfect.

[Message 135] Daniel: Okay.

[Message 136] Zara: Ok.

[Message 137] Daniel: You all good?

[Message 138] Zara: Yes.

[Message 139] Daniel: Ok.

[Message 140] Zara: I need to go find my cat.

[Message 141] Daniel: Okay, see you later.

[Message 142] Zara: See you!

[Message 143] Daniel: Ok bye.

[Message 144] Zara: Bye!

[Message 145] Daniel: Ok what film are we going to watch?

[Message 146] Marcus: I don't mind!

[Message 147] Daniel: Cool, so anything is good?

[Message 148] Marcus: Yeah, sure!

[Message 149] Daniel: Okay so I will find a good one!

[Message 150] Marcus: Okay!

[Message 151] Daniel: I feel bad for James, he was just doing his job.

[Message 152] Marcus: Yeah, so sad.

[Message 153] Daniel: Okay movie at 8 PM, right?

[Message 154] Marcus: Yeah! I can't wait!

[Message 155] Daniel: Cool, should be fun!

[Message 156] Marcus: Yeah, should be!

[Message 157] Daniel: Ok.

[Message 158] Marcus: See you tonight

[Message 159] Daniel: Yeah!

[Message 160] Marcus: Bye!

[Message 161] Daniel: Bye.

[Message 162] Marcus: He was looking up how to make Blunt force trauma with a hammer online.

[Message 163] Daniel: Who?

[Message 164] Marcus: No one!

[Message 165] Daniel: Yeah sure!

401,"[Message 1] Liam: Good morning, everyone! Hope you all had a restful night. Thinking of redoing my living room. Any thoughts on current trends?
[Message 2] Alex: Morning, Liam! I'm seeing a lot of natural textures and earthy tones. Think woven rugs, linen curtains, stuff like that.
[Message 3] Jordan: Morning! I'm more into minimalist design. Less is more, you know? Clean lines and functional pieces.
[Message 4] Chris: Morning all. Earthy tones, eh? Sounds comfy. I'm partial to a good recliner, myself. Function over form!
[Message 5] Liam: Earthy tones sound interesting, Alex. I do like a cozy vibe. Minimalism is too stark for me, Jordan.
[Message 6] Alex: Yeah, think warm browns, greens, maybe even a pop of terracotta.
[Message 7] Jordan: I respect the cozy vibe, Liam, but try decluttering first! You might be surprised how much space you gain.
[Message 8] Chris: Decluttering is always a good idea. Speaking of which, anyone got any good chili recipes for tonight? Family dinner, you know.
[Message 9] Liam: Chili sounds amazing, Chris! Haven't made chili in ages. I'll have to dig one up.
[Message 10] Alex: I could share my grandma's chili recipe! It's a secret, but I might make an exception.
[Message 11] Jordan: Chili sounds great. Back to decor, though... I'm thinking about adding a statement piece to my living room. Maybe a cool lamp.
[Message 12] Chris: Statement piece, huh? As long as it's comfortable! And doesn't get in the way of the TV.
[Message 13] Liam: A statement lamp sounds good, Jordan. I'm thinking of a new rug. Something with a bit of personality.
[Message 14] Alex: Ooh, rugs can really tie a room together. I saw a really cool Moroccan rug the other day.
[Message 15] Jordan: I saw a really interesting geometric one at Elevator last week. Pretty pricey, though.
[Message 16] Chris: Elevator, eh? Haven't been there in years. Used to go there with my wife all the time.
[Message 17] Liam: Geometric could work, Jordan. I'll have to check it out.
[Message 18] Alex: On a completely different note, did anyone see the Grizzlies game last night?
[Message 19] Jordan: I did! What a nail-biter!
[Message 20] Chris: Grizzlies are on fire this season! Back to chili... beans or no beans?
[Message 21] Liam: Beans! Definitely beans. Gives it some substance.
[Message 22] Alex: No beans! Ruins the texture.
[Message 23] Jordan: I'm with Alex, no beans!
[Message 24] Chris: A house divided! I'll make two pots, one with, one without. Problem solved.
[Message 25] Liam: Now that's a compromise! Back to rugs, I'm thinking something wool.
[Message 26] Alex: Wool is a good choice, very durable. Just watch out for shedding.
[Message 27] Jordan: True. Maybe a synthetic blend would be more practical?
[Message 28] Chris: Practicality is key. Especially with kids and pets running around.
[Message 29] Liam: No kids or pets here, but I appreciate the thought. Durability is still important though!
[Message 30] Alex: In that case, go for the wool! Treat yourself.
[Message 31] Jordan: I still think the geometric at Elevator is worth checking out.
[Message 32] Chris: Elevator's got some nice stuff. A bit pricey, but nice.
[Message 33] Liam: I think I will swing by Elevator this afternoon. Thanks, Jordan!
[Message 34] Alex: Let us know what you find!
[Message 35] Jordan: Definitely! Take pictures.
[Message 36] Chris: Pictures are a must! Gotta see the potential.
[Message 37] Liam: Will do! Anything else trending in home decor I should know about?
[Message 38] Alex: Greenery! Plants are everywhere right now.
[Message 39] Jordan: I agree, plants are a great way to add life to a room.
[Message 40] Chris: I kill every plant I touch. Stick to fake ones for me.
[Message 41] Liam: Fake plants, huh? I've never been a fan.
[Message 42] Alex: There are some surprisingly realistic fake plants these days!
[Message 43] Jordan: True, you can get some really good quality ones.
[Message 44] Chris: Exactly! No watering required. My kind of plant.
[Message 45] Liam: Maybe I'll consider it. I'm notoriously bad at remembering to water things.
[Message 46] Alex: Start with something low-maintenance, like a succulent.
[Message 47] Jordan: Or a snake plant. Very hard to kill.
[Message 48] Chris: Snake plant, huh? Sounds intimidating.
[Message 49] Liam: Snake plant it is! Thanks for the suggestion.
[Message 50] Alex: No problem! Always happy to enable plant purchases.
[Message 51] Jordan: Me too!
[Message 52] Chris: Just don't let it die on my conscience!
[Message 53] Liam: No promises! Seriously though, appreciate all the advice. This has been helpful.
[Message 54] Alex: Anytime, Liam!
[Message 55] Jordan: Yeah, good luck with the living room reno!
[Message 56] Chris: And the rug hunt! And the snake plant!
[Message 57] Liam: I'm on a mission! Now, about that chili recipe, Alex...
[Message 58] Alex: Okay, okay, I'll text it to you later.
[Message 59] Jordan: Make sure you share the results!
[Message 60] Chris: Pictures of the chili too! Both pots.
[Message 61] Liam: You got it! This is going to be a very well-documented evening.
[Message 62] Alex: Hahaha, I can't wait.
[Message 63] Jordan: Me neither!
[Message 64] Chris: Alright, gotta get back to work. Talk to you all later!
[Message 65] Liam: Later, Chris! Thanks again everyone.",0,

[Message 6] Sarah: ""I've seen the CR-V, it looks nice. A bit pricey, maybe?""
[Message 7] David: ""Yeah, they can be. The Crosstrek is generally a bit more affordable. Have you considered a hybrid?""

[Message 55] Sarah: ""A cat-proof room is tempting! I'm pretty sure she'd just find a way to break in.""

[Message 58] Mark: ""Yeah, car prices are insane right now. Have you considered buying used?""
[Message 59] Sarah: ""I'm a bit hesitant about used cars, worried about hidden problems.""
[Message 60] Mark: ""That's fair. Get a pre-purchase inspection if you do. It's worth the money.""
[Message 61] Sarah: ""Good point. I will. Did you catch the game last night?""
[Message 62] Mark: ""I did! What a nail-biter! Thought we were going to lose for sure.""
[Message 63] Sarah: ""Me too! The last few minutes were intense. Glad they pulled it off.""
[Message 64] Mark: ""Definitely. Okay, I should get back to work. Don't let the salespeople bully you!""
[Message 65] Sarah: ""Will do! Thanks again for the advice, Mark.""
[Message 66] Mark: ""Anytime, Sarah! Good luck!""
[Message 67] Maria: ""Hey Sarah! Car shopping, huh? What's up?""
[Message 68] Sarah: ""Hey Maria! Just trying to find something that won't bankrupt me at the gas pump.""
[Message 69] Maria: ""I feel that! Gas prices are ridiculous. I'm thinking of getting an electric scooter for short trips.""
[Message 70] Sarah: ""That's actually a good idea! I've seen people zipping around on those. Do they handle hills well?""
[Message 71] Maria: ""Some of them do! You have to look for ones with a powerful motor. I'm still researching.""
[Message 72] Sarah: ""Okay, good to know. So many things to research! Cars, scooters...""
[Message 73] Maria: ""Tell me about it. What about your cat? Still causing chaos?""
[Message 74] Sarah: ""Always. This morning she tried to climb the curtains. Nearly gave me a heart attack.""
[Message 75] Maria: ""Oh my god! My rabbit, Thumper, chewed through my phone charger last night. I woke up to 0% battery.""
[Message 76] Sarah: ""That's terrible! Animals are so destructive sometimes, but we love them anyway, right?""
[Message 77] Maria: ""Exactly! I can't imagine life without Thumper, even if he does have a penchant for electronics.""
[Message 78] Sarah: ""Same with Mittens. She's my little chaos gremlin. Back to cars – have you looked at any SUVs?""
[Message 79] Maria: ""SUVs are tempting for the extra space, but I worry about the gas mileage.""
[Message 80] Sarah: ""Yeah, that's my concern too. I saw a Kia Niro. It's a hybrid SUV.""
[Message 81] Maria: ""Kia Niro? I'll have to check that out. Kia has really stepped up their game lately.""
[Message 82] Sarah: ""I agree. They used to be known for cheap cars, but now they're making some pretty stylish and reliable vehicles.""
[Message 83] Maria: ""Definitely. So, teacher-student conferences. How are those going?""
[Message 84] Sarah: ""Haven't had one in years! Since college, I guess. Why do you ask?""
[Message 85] Maria: ""Just curious about your experience. My cousin was asking me about theirs. He’s stressed about his kid’s grades.""
[Message 86] Sarah: ""Ah, gotcha. They can be nerve-wracking. Just try to be open-minded and listen to what the teacher has to say.""
[Message 87] Maria: ""Good advice. I'll pass that along. Okay, I need to run. Good luck with the car hunting!""
[Message 88] Sarah: ""Thanks, Maria! Talk to you soon!""
[Message 89] John: ""Hey Sarah, how's the car search coming along?""
[Message 90] Sarah: ""Hey John! Still searching. It's a jungle out there.""
[Message 91] John: ""I know the feeling. I went through that last year. What are your priorities?""
[Message 92] Sarah: ""Reliability, fuel efficiency, and hopefully something under $30k.""
[Message 93] John: ""Okay, that's a reasonable list. Have you considered a Toyota Corolla? Super reliable and great gas mileage.""
[Message 94] Sarah: ""Corolla is a classic! I'll add it to the list. What about Subaru Impreza?""
[Message 95] John: ""Impreza is a good choice too! All-wheel drive is a bonus, especially for Denver winters.""
[Message 96] Sarah: ""True! I've definitely been stuck in the snow a few times. Speaking of which, Mittens hates snow.""
[Message 97] John: ""Haha! My dog, Max, loves it. He goes crazy for snowballs.""
[Message 98] Sarah: ""That's adorable! Mittens just glares at it from the window. She's a diva.""
[Message 99] John: ""Cats are definitely more discerning when it comes to weather. Any luck with that hiking buddy you mentioned?""
[Message 100] Sarah: ""Possibly! David offered to go sometime. Haven't set a date yet.""
[Message 101] John: ""Nice! Evergreen is great for hiking. Lots of good trails.""
[Message 102] Sarah: ""I agree. I did the Alderfer/Three Sisters loop last weekend. Stunning views.""
[Message 103] John: ""I've heard good things about that one! I usually hike near Red Rocks. Easier to get to from my place.""
[Message 104] Sarah: ""Red Rocks is beautiful too! I love going to concerts there. Have you seen any good shows lately?""
[Message 105] John: ""Not recently, unfortunately. Work has been crazy. I'm hoping to catch a show this summer, though.""
[Message 106] Sarah: ""Me too! Okay, back to cars... This salesperson is trying to upsell me on everything.""
[Message 107] John: ""Ugh, classic dealership tactics. Just stick to your guns and don't let them pressure you.""
[Message 108] Sarah: ""Easier said than done! They're very persistent.""
[Message 109] John: ""I know! Just keep saying ""no"" and walk away if you need to. Your budget is your budget.""
[Message 110] Sarah: ""Thanks, John! I appreciate the support. I'm starting to feel overwhelmed.""
[Message 111] John: ""No problem! It's a big decision. Just take your time and don't settle for anything you're not happy with.""
[Message 112] Sarah: ""I'll try! I might just end up keeping my old car and dealing with the gas prices.""
[Message 113] John: ""Haha! That's always an option. Okay, I gotta run. Good luck!""
[Message 114] Sarah: ""Thanks, John! Talk to you later!""
[Message 115] Emily: ""Hey Sarah! Hear you're car shopping. How's it going?""
[Message 116] Sarah: ""Hey Emily! It's...an experience. Feeling very lost.""
[Message 117] Emily: ""I can imagine! What are you looking for specifically?""
[Message 118] Sarah: ""Good gas mileage, reliable, and not too expensive. The usual!""
[Message 119] Emily: ""Have you thought about a Nissan Leaf? It's fully electric, so no gas at all!""
[Message 120] Sarah: ""Leaf? I'm a little nervous about the range. I do like to hike and drive longer distances sometimes.""
[Message 121] Emily: ""That's a fair point. The range has improved on newer models, but it's still something to consider. How’s Mittens?""
[Message 122] Sarah: ""Mittens is currently judging me from the top of the bookshelf. She thinks I should just stay home and pet her all day.""
[Message 123] Emily: ""Sounds about right! My goldfish, Finny, just stares blankly at the wall. Much less demanding.""
[Message 124] Sarah: ""Haha! Finny sounds very Zen. I wish Mittens was more like Finny sometimes.""
[Message 125] Emily: ""Be careful what you wish for! Zen goldfish are not very entertaining. Have you looked at the Honda Civic?""
[Message 126] Sarah: ""Civic is always a solid choice! Reliable and good gas mileage, right?""
[Message 127] Emily: ""Yep! Plus, they hold their value pretty well. What did you think about the Henderson presentation yesterday?""
[Message 128] Sarah: ""Honestly? It was pretty boring. Lots of corporate jargon and not much substance.""
[Message 129] Emily: ""I agree! I was trying to stay awake. I think I dozed off for a few minutes.""
[Message 130] Sarah: ""I wouldn't be surprised! I was fighting the urge to check my phone the whole time.""
[Message 131] Emily: ""Okay, back to cars... Are you planning on financing or paying cash?""
[Message 132] Sarah: ""Probably financing. My savings account isn't quite ready for a car purchase.""
[Message 133] Emily: ""Shop around for interest rates! Dealership financing isn't always the best option.""
[Message 134] Sarah: ""Good point! I'll check with my bank. Thanks, Emily!""
[Message 135] Emily: ""No problem! I hope you find something you love. Don't settle!""
[Message 136] Sarah: ""I won't! Thanks again. Talk to you later!""
[Message 137] Emily: ""Later, Sarah!""
[Message 138] Ben: ""Hey Sarah! Car shopping? Good luck with that!""
[Message 139] Sarah: ""Hey Ben! I need all the luck I can get. It's overwhelming!""
[Message 140] Ben: ""Tell me about it. What's on your wish list?""
[Message 141] Sarah: ""Good gas mileage is a must! And reliable. Budget is around $30k, hopefully.""
[Message 142] Ben: ""Okay, sounds reasonable. Have you considered a Hyundai Kona? They're pretty stylish and get good gas mileage.""
[Message 143] Sarah: ""Kona? I haven't really looked at those. I'll check them out. Thanks!""
[Message 144] Ben: ""No problem! My neighbor has one and loves it. So, how's Mittens been behaving?""
[Message 145] Sarah: ""Mittens is currently plotting world domination, I think. She's been staring intently at the globe.""
[Message 146] Ben: ""Haha! My hamster, Nibbles, just runs on his wheel all day. Much less ambitious.""
[Message 147] Sarah: ""Nibbles sounds very dedicated to his fitness! Mittens prefers naps and strategic planning.""
[Message 148] Ben: ""Definitely different approaches to life! So, any interesting news from Henderson's conference?""
[Message 149] Sarah: ""Not really. He just talked about deadlines and budgets. Pretty standard stuff.""
[Message 150] Ben: ""Sounds about right. He's a creature of habit. I hope you are having a good teacher-student meeting.""
[Message 151] Sarah: ""Thanks. I hope too.""
[Message 152] Ben: ""Okay, back to cars. Do you have any specific features you're looking for?""
[Message 153] Sarah: ""Android Auto is a must! I rely on Google Maps way too much.""
[Message 154] Ben: ""Definitely! I can't live without Android Auto either. Makes driving so much easier.""
[Message 155] Sarah: ""Agreed! Okay, I need to focus and try to make a decision. This salesperson is circling like a shark.""
[Message 156] Ben: ""Stay strong! Remember your budget and don't let them pressure you.""
[Message 157] Sarah: ""I'll try! Thanks for the pep talk, Ben!""
[Message 158] Ben: ""Anytime, Sarah! Good luck!""
[Message 159] Sarah: ""Thanks, Ben! Talk to you later!""
[Message 160] Ben: ""Later!""
[Message 161] Liam: ""Hey Sarah, how's the car hunt going? Still surviving the dealership?""
[Message 162] Sarah: ""Hey Liam! Barely! So many choices, so much pressure!""
[Message 163] Liam: ""Tell me about it. What's your game plan?""
[Message 164] Sarah: ""Trying to find something reliable, fuel-efficient, and within my budget. It's a challenge!""
[Message 165] Liam: ""It is! Have you looked at any hatchbacks? They can be surprisingly spacious and get good gas mileage.""
[Message 166] Sarah: ""Hatchbacks... Not really my style, but I'm open to anything at this point. What about safety features?""
[Message 167] Liam: ""Definitely prioritize safety! Look for features like blind-spot monitoring and lane departure warning. They can be lifesavers.""
[Message 168] Sarah: ""Good point! I'll keep that in mind. Thanks, Liam!""
[Message 169] Liam: ""No problem! Remember, it's YOUR money. Don't let them push you into anything you don't want.""
[Message 170] Sarah: ""I'll try my best! Thanks again!""",0,

[Message 3] Sarah: ""I know, so awful. Poor souls. Makes you think, you know?""
[Message 4] Mark: ""Definitely. You heading to Lisa's party tonight?""
[Message 5] Sarah: ""Yeah, gotta get my mind off things. Need to pick up some snacks first. You bringing anything?""
[Message 6] Mark: ""Just myself and maybe some beers. Did you know either of them - David or Ben?""
[Message 7] Sarah: ""David? No, I don't think so. Ben's name sounds familiar... Maybe from the activist group?""
[Message 8] Mark: ""Could be. He was pretty involved in that stuff. Anyway, see you tonight?""
[Message 9] Sarah: ""Definitely! Later!""
[Message 10] Emily: ""Guys, this whole thing is freaking me out. I was just at the vet clinic yesterday.""
[Message 11] Jessica: ""Tell me about it, Em. I drive past it every day on my way to work. It's too close to home.""
[Message 12] Emily: ""I saw that raspy-voiced girl, Ashley, near there yesterday at like Early Afternoon. Seemed stressed.""
[Message 13] Jessica: ""Ashley? Really? I know her. She works part-time at the coffee shop downtown. She seems quiet.""
[Message 14] Emily: ""Yeah, but she looked like she was arguing with someone on the phone. I wonder what was up.""
[Message 15] Jessica: ""Maybe she just had a bad day. People argue on the phone all the time.""
[Message 16] Emily: ""True. Still, weird timing, right?""
[Message 17] Jessica: ""Everything's weird right now. Did anyone know David the corrections officer personally?""
[Message 18] Emily: ""Nope. Heard he was kinda strict.""
[Message 19] Jake: ""This is insane. My uncle knew David. Said he was a real hardass. No one will miss him.""
[Message 20] Chloe: ""Jake! That's a terrible thing to say. Two people died.""
[Message 21] Jake: ""I'm just saying what people are thinking. David gave a lot of people a hard time. Ben, though, that sucks. He was trying to make a difference.""
[Message 22] Chloe: ""Still... have some respect.""
[Message 23] Jake: ""Whatever. You think they'll catch who did it?""
[Message 24] Chloe: ""I hope so. For Ben's sake, at least.""
[Message 25] Ashley: ""Hey, you guys seen all the police activity downtown?""
[Message 26] Liam: ""Yeah, crazy, right? Something about a Car accident (vehicular homicide) at the vet clinic. You okay, Ash?""
[Message 27] Ashley: ""Just a little shaken up. I was near there yesterday. Close call.""
[Message 28] Liam: ""Glad you're alright. You know, I saw Ben arguing with David the other day. Something about a protest.""
[Message 29] Ashley: ""Really? I didn't know they knew each other.""
[Message 30] Liam: ""Yeah, it was heated. Ben was yelling about corruption. David looked pissed. Ben intended to make David listen to him""
[Message 31] Ashley: ""Wow. This is all so messed up.""
[Message 32] Liam: ""It is. They're going away for a long time for this. You heading to the vigil for Ben tomorrow?""
[Message 33] Ashley: ""Yeah, I think I will. Need to pay my respects. It was an accident, right?""
[Message 34] Liam: ""That's what they're saying. Vehicular homicide.""

[Message 36] Liam: ""Later.""
[Message 37] Mark: ""Anyone know if they found the car yet?""
[Message 38] Jessica: ""Last I heard, no. Police are still searching.""
[Message 39] Emily: ""This is just a hunch but i saw Ashley buying a car part at the store""
[Message 40] Sarah: ""Did the activist, Ben, have any enemies?""
[Message 41] Jake: ""Probably a ton. He pissed off a lot of people with his protests. He was aware it might happen.""
[Message 42] Chloe: ""Don't start, Jake.""
[Message 43] Jake: ""What? It's true! He knew the risks.""
[Message 44] Chloe: ""Still, it doesn't excuse what happened.""
[Message 45] Mark: ""Anyone know why Ashley was near the vet? Maybe she was taking her pet to the vet.""
[Message 46] Sarah: ""Good point, Mark. Could be completely innocent.""
[Message 47] Liam: ""Yeah, let's not jump to conclusions. Everyone's on edge.""
[Message 48] Jessica: ""True. Still can't shake the feeling that something's off.""
[Message 49] Emily: ""Me neither.""
[Message 50] Ashley: ""Hey, has anyone talked to Mrs. Davis? David fired her from the clinic last week.""
[Message 51] Liam: ""I didn't know that. She might be a suspect.""
[Message 52] Jessica: ""That's rough. Wonder what happened.""
[Message 53] Emily: ""I heard she was stealing medication.""
[Message 54] Jessica: ""Wow, that's serious.""
[Message 55] Jake: ""See? Everyone had a motive.""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Stop it, Jake.""
[Message 57] Mark: ""Let's not speculate. Let the police do their job.""

407,"[Message 1] Kai: Hey, have you guys heard about what happened at Amusement Park?
[Message 2] Liv: Yeah, it's all over the news. Brutal.
[Message 3] Ren: I know, right? Crazy. Two people...
[Message 4] Kai: Poor Alex. And the manager.
[Message 5] Liv: It's awful. Alex was just a kid.
[Message 6] Ren: Did they say anything about who did it?
[Message 7] Kai: No, just that they're investigating. I hope they catch the person who did that quickly.
[Message 8] Liv: Me too. I can't believe something like that happened in Gulfport.
[Message 9] Ren: Gulfport is getting crazy these days. It was only a matter of time.
[Message 10] Kai: Don't say that, Ren. It could have happened anywhere.
[Message 11] Liv: True. Anyway, you guys wanna grab coffee later? Distract ourselves?
[Message 12] Ren: I'm in. Need something strong after hearing that.
[Message 13] Kai: I’m free, see you there.
[Message 14] Liv: Cool, noon at Java Joe's?
[Message 15] Ren: Sounds good.
[Message 16] Kai: Perfect.
[Message 17] Ren: So, Kai, you worked security there, right?
[Message 18] Kai: Yeah, but I quit a few months ago. It’s a tough job.
[Message 19] Liv: Did you know Alex well?
[Message 20] Kai: A little. Just from seeing them around. They were always really nice, though.
[Message 21] Ren: That sucks.
[Message 22] Kai: It does.
[Message 23] Liv: I heard the manager, um… Jordan, was kind of a jerk.
[Message 24] Ren: Oh yeah? How so?
[Message 25] Liv: Just… hard to work for, apparently. That’s what my friend who works there told me.
[Message 26] Kai: I heard similar things. But still doesn't justify anything.
[Message 27] Ren: True. Still, makes you wonder.
[Message 28] Liv: Wonder what?
[Message 29] Ren: If someone had a grudge.
[Message 30] Kai: Everyone has something against someone. Doesn't make them a murderer.
[Message 31] Liv: I know, I know. Just thinking out loud.
[Message 32] Ren: Me too.
[Message 33] Kai: Gotta head out, see you guys at noon.
[Message 34] Liv: Later!
[Message 35] Ren: Peace.
[Message 36] Ren: Hey Liv, you still online?
[Message 37] Liv: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 38] Ren: Something's bugging me about Kai.
[Message 39] Liv: What do you mean?
[Message 40] Ren: Just… seemed a little too quick to defend everyone.
[Message 41] Liv: You think Kai had something to do with it?
[Message 42] Ren: I don’t know! It’s probably nothing. But something felt off.
[Message 43] Liv: Kai’s always been a little intense. Remember that time they got into it with that guy at the bar?
[Message 44] Ren: Good point. But this is different. This is murder.
[Message 45] Liv: Alright, alright. I'll keep an eye on them. Don't go accusing anyone without proof.
[Message 46] Ren: I won't. Just… be careful.
[Message 47] Liv: Always am. See you at Java Joe's.
[Message 48] Ren: Later.
[Message 49] Kai: Hey, running a little late. Be there in 15.
[Message 50] Liv: No worries.
[Message 51] Ren: Okay.
[Message 52] Liv: So, Kai, anything new from the news?
[Message 53] Kai: Not really. Just the same stuff. ""Investigation ongoing,"" ""community in shock,"" blah blah blah.
[Message 54] Ren: You seem awfully calm about all this, Kai.
[Message 55] Kai: What's that supposed to mean, Ren?
[Message 56] Ren: Nothing. Just an observation.
[Message 57] Liv: Guys, let's not start. We're here to relax.
[Message 58] Kai: Relax? Two people are dead. How am I supposed to relax?
[Message 59] Ren: Nobody's saying you have to be happy-go-lucky, Kai. Just...you know.
[Message 60] Liv: Ren, drop it.
[Message 61] Kai: No, let him talk. What are you implying, Ren? That I had something to do with it?
[Message 62] Ren: I didn't say that!
[Message 63] Liv: Okay, that's enough! I'm leaving. This isn't helping anyone.
[Message 64] Kai: Liv, wait!
[Message 65] Ren: She's right. This is getting us nowhere.
[Message 66] Kai: Fine. But I'm not gonna sit here and be accused of something I didn't do.
[Message 67] Ren: I didn't accuse you of anything!
[Message 68] Kai: Sure seemed like it.
[Message 69] Liv: (Later that evening) Ren, are you free to talk?
[Message 70] Ren: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 71] Liv: I've been thinking about what you said about Kai.
[Message 72] Ren: And?
[Message 73] Liv: I remembered something. Kai was REALLY upset when Jordan fired them a few months ago. Like, REALLY upset.
[Message 74] Ren: See? I knew something was up.
[Message 75] Liv: It could still be nothing. But it's worth looking into.
[Message 76] Ren: I agree. Maybe we should tell the police.
[Message 77] Liv: Not yet. Let's see what else we can find out first.
[Message 78] Ren: Okay. But if Kai did do this…
[Message 79] Liv: I know. It's a big if.
[Message 80] Ren: I'm just scared.
[Message 81] Liv: Me too.
[Message 82] Kai: (to Ren) Hey, sorry about earlier. I overreacted.
[Message 83] Ren: It's okay. I probably did too.
[Message 84] Kai: Friends?
[Message 85] Ren: Friends.
[Message 86] Kai: I just… I hate that this happened. And I hate that people are gonna automatically suspect anyone who worked there.
[Message 87] Ren: Yeah, I get it.
[Message 88] Kai: I was at the park the day before. Saw both of them. It's hitting me harder than I thought.
[Message 89] Ren: It’s alright to feel.
[Message 90] Kai: Thanks.
[Message 91] Liv: Hey guys, I'm really sorry I bailed earlier. I was being insensitive.
[Message 92] Kai: No worries, Liv. We all are.
[Message 93] Ren: Yeah, no big deal.
[Message 94] Liv: So, any new leads in the case?
[Message 95] Kai: Nope. Just the same old story.
[Message 96] Ren: Nothing.
[Message 97] Liv: I heard a rumor that Alex was planning on quitting. Maybe Jordan didn't like that.
[Message 98] Kai: That's possible. Jordan wasn't exactly known for being understanding.
[Message 99] Ren: Jordan always had that menacing aura around him.
[Message 100] Liv: True. Hey, Ren, weren't you looking into getting a job at Amusement Park?
[Message 101] Ren: Yeah, why?
[Message 102] Liv: Just curious. Guess that's off the table now, huh?
[Message 103] Ren: Probably. Who would want to work there now?
[Message 104] Liv: Good point. Hey, Kai, I have a question. Did Jordan ever mention anything about wanting to get rid of Alex?
[Message 105] Kai: No, never. That’s insane.
[Message 106] Liv: Just wondering.
[Message 107] Ren: It's messed up to even think like that.
[Message 108] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 109] Liv: Guys, something's not adding up. Kai, you said you were at the park the day before, right? What time did you leave?
[Message 110] Kai: Around 7pm. Why?
[Message 111] Liv: Just checking. Did you see anything… unusual?
[Message 112] Kai: No, not really. Just the usual park stuff. People having fun, kids screaming, you know.
[Message 113] Ren: ""Having fun""? Two people are dead, Kai.
[Message 114] Kai: I meant the day before. Before… all of this.
[Message 115] Liv: Okay. I'm going to call the police. This is getting too heavy for us.
[Message 116] Ren: I agree.
[Message 117] Kai: Wait! What are you going to tell them?
[Message 118] Liv: Everything we've talked about. Everything we know.
[Message 119] Kai: That's a mistake.
[Message 120] Ren: Why? What are you hiding, Kai?
[Message 121] Kai: I'm not hiding anything! I just don't want us to get involved. It's dangerous.
[Message 122] Liv: Two people are dead, Kai! How much more involved can we get?
[Message 123] Ren: Exactly.
[Message 124] Kai: Fine. Do what you want. But don't say I didn't warn you.
[Message 125] Liv: Don't try to scare us, Kai. It won't work.
[Message 126] Ren: Yeah, we're not backing down.
[Message 127] Kai: Just… be careful.
[Message 128] Liv: Always am.
[Message 129] Liv: (To Ren, later) Hey, I talked to the police.
[Message 130] Ren: And?
[Message 131] Liv: They're going to look into everything. Kai, Jordan, everything.
[Message 132] Ren: Good.
[Message 133] Liv: I feel a little better knowing they're on it.
[Message 134] Ren: Me too. What about Kai’s reaction?
[Message 135] Liv: Definitely hiding something. I think we are getting closer to the truth.
[Message 136] Ren: I hope so. I cant sleep.
[Message 137] Liv: It is true that Jordan can be quite annoying. He was always picking on me.
[Message 138] Ren: Oh damn. Guess that is true.
[Message 139] Kai: I think Liv called the police and mentioned my name. This is bad.
[Message 140] Ren: Maybe you should call them yourself.
[Message 141] Kai: No way! That will look super suspicious. I rather just wait.
[Message 142] Ren: I think it is a good idea, so you can speak the truth.
[Message 143] Kai: I was protecting my loved ones from getting hurt.
[Message 144] Ren: You always talking about that, Kai. Why?
[Message 145] Kai: It is just something I always believed in. It is stupid. I know!
[Message 146] Ren: I think we should all take a breather.
[Message 147] Liv: I saw Ren buy Administering a lethal injection a few days ago.
[Message 148] Kai: WHAAAT?
[Message 149] Ren: I got it for my dog, he has cancer!
[Message 150] Liv: Oh, okay.
[Message 151] Kai: That is so messed up, Liv.
[Message 152] Ren: I know right. And I'm gonna get in trouble for doing this with him.
[Message 153] Liv: I didn't know, Ren.
[Message 154] Kai: I am going to sleep!
[Message 155] Ren: Good Night!
[Message 156] Liv: Sleep tight!
[Message 157] Ren: The cops are at my door.
[Message 158] Liv: What?!
[Message 159] Ren: I think you are the one that got me in trouble.
[Message 160] Liv: I am so sorry.
[Message 161] Ren: It is alright, just tell the truth.
[Message 162] Liv: Will do.
[Message 163] Liv: Kai, are you awake?
[Message 164] Kai: Yeah, what's going on? I saw police cars heading towards Ren's place.
[Message 165] Liv: They're questioning Ren. I told them about the Administering a lethal injection.
[Message 166] Kai: What?! Are you crazy? You just threw Ren under the bus.
[Message 167] Liv: I had to! It was the right thing to do. Ren always hated Alex.
[Message 168] Kai: That doesn't mean they killed Alex! You need to tell them about Jordan and the way Jordan treated people. It might have provoked something! I was there the other night. I knew they were going to kill him! I tried to talk Ren out of it, but they wouldn't listen.
[Message 169] Liv: I… I didn't know.
[Message 170] Kai: Now two people are going to get the death penalty! And its on you now.",1,

[Message 2] Jamie: Yup, just got here! Perfect time to chill before the craziness of tomorrow.
[Message 3] River: Totally agree, Jamie. Quiet is nice. Anyone bring snacks?
[Message 4] Blake: I did! Got some pretzels and water. Saving my energy for the skating.
[Message 5] Casey: Pretzels sound amazing, Blake! I’m starving. Just finished prepping for my interview tomorrow.
[Message 6] Alex: Oh yeah, Casey, good luck with the interview! What's the role?
[Message 7] Casey: Thanks, Alex! It’s a junior marketing position at a local firm. Nervous!
[Message 8] Jamie: You got this, Casey! Just be yourself. And tell them about your amazing pets! Companies love that.
[Message 9] River: Totally! My cat once interrupted a Zoom meeting by walking across my keyboard. Got me the job. Maybe.
[Message 10] Blake: Haha, River! My dog just sleeps through everything. Completely useless for job interviews.
[Message 11] Alex: My parrot tries to mimic everyone. It's usually more embarrassing than helpful. Once squawked ""You're hired!"" before the interviewer could say anything.
[Message 12] Jamie: Alex, that’s hilarious! Imagine the interviewer's face!
[Message 13] Casey: Oh man, I wish I had a pet story that good. Mine just eat and sleep.
[Message 14] River: Speak for yourself! My cat also knocks things off shelves at 3 AM. Very dedicated to chaos.
[Message 15] Blake: My dog's dedication is to shedding. Mountains of fur. You could knit a whole other dog with it.
[Message 16] Alex: Has anyone tried those pet hair vacuum attachments? Do they actually work?
[Message 17] Jamie: Some of them are decent. But honestly, nothing beats just… accepting the fur as part of the decor.
[Message 18] River: Truth. I've given up. My apartment is now officially a cat fur sanctuary.
[Message 19] Blake: I've started wearing black all the time. It hides the white fur. Mostly.
[Message 20] Casey: Okay, back to interviews… should I mention my fish? They're pretty boring.
[Message 21] Alex: Probably not, Casey. Focus on skills and experience. Unless you can spin a good yarn about goldfish training.
[Message 22] Jamie: Maybe mention you're good at observing things, like a fish in a bowl? Relate it to market research or something.
[Message 23] River: Genius, Jamie! See, pets *are* helpful for job interviews!
[Message 24] Blake: Good luck finding a marketing angle with my shedding machine. ""Expert in creating fluffy distractions?""
[Message 25] Casey: Ha! Maybe ""Proven ability to maintain composure in stressful, hairy situations."" Thanks for the tips, guys!
[Message 26] Alex: Anytime, Casey! Rooting for you. So, anyone actually skating? Or are we just a support group for pet owners?
[Message 27] Jamie: I’m up for skating! Needed to stretch my legs after that long shift anyway.
[Message 28] River: Count me in! Let's do this.
[Message 29] Blake: I'll join you guys in a bit. Gotta finish these pretzels first. Fuel is important.
[Message 30] Casey: I'll watch and cheer you on! Pre-interview jitters are kicking in.
[Message 31] Alex: Alright! Let’s hit the rink! Race you to the Zamboni!
[Message 32] Jamie: You're on!
[Message 33] River: (Screams from afar) Wait up! My ankles are not what they used to be!
[Message 34] Blake: River, maybe stick to the bench for this round. We don’t want any broken hips.
[Message 35] River: Harsh, Blake. Harsh but fair.
[Message 36] Casey: Anyone know where the best coffee place is around here? Need a serious caffeine boost.
[Message 37] Alex: There’s a place called ""The Daily Grind"" a few blocks down. Pretty good, but can be crowded.
[Message 38] Jamie: Yeah, The Daily Grind is solid. They have a great iced latte.
[Message 39] River: I'm more of a tea person myself. Less jittery.
[Message 40] Blake: Coffee makes me crash. Hard. I’ll stick with water. Hydration is key.
[Message 41] Casey: Thanks for the recommendation! I'll check it out after this. Need to be alert for tomorrow.
[Message 42] Alex: So, anyone got any funny pet stories from this week? Besides River's cat's midnight remodeling project.
[Message 43] Jamie: My gecko escaped its tank and was found chilling in my sock drawer. Talk about a surprise.
[Message 44] River: A gecko in a sock drawer! That's amazing. What was it thinking?
[Message 45] Blake: My dog tried to eat a bee. Swollen snout ensued. Serves him right.
[Message 46] Casey: Oh no, poor pup! Hope he's okay.
[Message 47] Alex: My parrot learned to say ""Alexa, play classical music."" Very cultured bird. Except it only likes polka.
[Message 48] Jamie: Haha! A polka-loving parrot. That's a first.
[Message 49] River: This has been lovely, but I should probably head home. Old lady bedtime calls.

[Message 164] Jamie: ""Remember that time you saw Alex leaving the building right when the sunset? That was the day of the murders, right?""
[Message 165] Kai: ""Yes, I did see him leave then.""
[Message 166] Jamie: ""Interesting.""
[Message 167] Jamie: ""Hey Kai? If someone did something terrible, do you think they should confess, or try to hide it? Maybe Marie's death was not an intervening cause, but they failed to call 911 after she was hurt, making the harm worse.""

[Message 4] Pat: ""Oh, the one at Beachfront? I think I saw a poster for it. What kind of crafts?""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Apparently everything! Pottery, jewelry, textiles...the whole shebang. They said there'll be food trucks too.""
[Message 6] Pat: ""Hmm, that actually sounds kind of nice. I need something to take my mind off this job hunt.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Exactly! Plus, fresh air. Speaking of, how's your mom doing? Last time we talked she wasn't feeling so great.""
[Message 8] Pat: ""She's doing a bit better, thanks for asking! Still a bit under the weather, but the medicine seems to be helping.""

[Message 11] Alex: ""It's the weekend of the 15th. I was thinking maybe Saturday afternoon?""
[Message 12] Pat: ""The 15th...that could work. Let me check my schedule and get back to you.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Sounds good! No pressure either way. I might go alone if you're busy.""
[Message 14] Pat: ""Well, I do need to get out of the house more. I've been cooped up worrying about this job.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""See? Perfect opportunity! Think of all the artisanal cheese you could sample.""
[Message 16] Pat: ""Artisanal cheese? You know my weakness!""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Haha! I know you too well. So, tentative yes?""
[Message 18] Pat: ""Tentative yes. What time do you think it would start getting busy?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Probably around noon? It runs all day, though. Maybe we could aim for around 2pm? That way the initial rush is over.""
[Message 20] Pat: ""2pm sounds good. Less crowds is always a plus.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Agreed. Plus, maybe we can catch the sunset over the water afterward?""

[Message 24] Pat: ""A friend date! I like it. I'll confirm for sure by Friday. Gotta check with the mom first.""

[Message 30] Pat: ""It was a 1950s number, emerald green with little cap sleeves. Just gorgeous.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Emerald green is your color! You should totally go back and get it.""
[Message 32] Pat: ""I'm tempted! But I'm trying to be good and save money in case I don't get this job.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Treat yourself! One dress won't break the bank. And you deserve it.""
[Message 34] Pat: ""You're enabling me! I love it. Maybe I will...""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Do it! And wear it to the festival! Instant chic.""
[Message 36] Pat: ""Okay, okay, you've convinced me. I'll see if it's still there tomorrow.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Excellent! Now, about that cheese...""
[Message 38] Pat: ""Haha! You're incorrigible. We haven't even gone to the festival yet and you're already planning our cheese strategy.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Gotta have a plan! We need to prioritize.""
[Message 40] Pat: ""Alright, I'm putting you in charge of cheese strategy. I'll focus on the vintage clothing.""

[Message 42] Pat: ""I'm looking forward to it. Thanks for the invite, Alex.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Of course, Pat! Always a pleasure. So, I was thinking about maybe even bringing a blanket.""
[Message 44] Pat: ""A blanket? For sitting?""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Yeah! If we find a nice spot by the water, we could just chill and watch the sunset.""
[Message 46] Pat: ""That's a good idea. I'll bring one if you forget.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""You're the best, Pat. A true festival companion.""
[Message 48] Pat: ""Someone has to keep you organized. Otherwise, you'd be wandering around in a haze of artisanal cheese fumes.""

[Message 52] Pat: ""Good question. I didn't see one on the poster. Maybe we can find one online?""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Worth a shot. I'll do some digging later. Gotta run to the grocery store now.""
[Message 54] Pat: ""Alright, have fun! Don't buy too much cheese before the festival!""
[Message 55] Alex: ""I'll try my best. See you later, Pat!""

[Message 75] Alex: ""Exactly! Cheese first, obviously. Then pottery. Then maybe jewelry?""
[Message 76] Pat: ""Sounds good to me! And we can check out the vintage clothing section too, if there is one.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Fingers crossed! Alright, I'm gonna go make dinner. What are you having?""
[Message 78] Pat: ""Probably just some soup. Nothing too exciting.""
[Message 79] Alex: ""Soup sounds good on a chilly evening. Enjoy!""

[Message 6] MARK: ""Sure.""
[Message 7] SARAH: ""Hey Anna, did you see what happened at The Velvet Room?""
[Message 8] ANNA: ""No! What happened?""
[Message 9] SARAH: ""Apparently, Leo and Tiffany were found dead there. Late Afternoon.""
[Message 10] ANNA: ""WHAT?! Leo? The bartender? And Tiffany? The 6.  Drug Dealer? Oh my god.""
[Message 11] SARAH: ""I know, right? Crazy. Police are all over the place.""
[Message 12] ANNA: ""I can't believe it. I just saw Leo last week. He seemed withdrawn lately. Did they say how?""
[Message 13] SARAH: ""I heard it was Asphyxiation by strangulation.""
[Message 14] ANNA: ""Asphyxiation by strangulation? That's awful. I hope they catch whoever did it.""
[Message 15] MARK: ""Hey, anyone heard anything about what happened at the club?""
[Message 16] ANNA: ""Yeah, Mark, it's all over the news. Leo and Tiffany are dead. Asphyxiation by strangulation.""
[Message 17] MARK: ""Damn. That's…rough. I knew Leo.""
[Message 18] SARAH: ""So did everyone, Mark.""
[Message 19] MARK: ""Just saying. He always seemed like a decent guy. Really withdrawn.""
[Message 20] ANNA: ""Yeah, he was. Tiffany, though… I heard she had a lot of enemies. She was stubborn about her deals.""
[Message 21] MARK: ""Enemies? Like who?""
[Message 22] ANNA: ""I don't know, just rumors. Stuff you hear around.""
[Message 23] SARAH: ""The cops are going to be grilling everyone who was there regularly, I bet.""
[Message 24] MARK: ""Guess so.""
[Message 25] ANNA: ""Hey Sarah, you remember Jake? He used to be obsessed with Tiffany.""
[Message 26] SARAH: ""Vaguely. The weirdo with the ring? What about him?""
[Message 27] ANNA: ""I overheard him saying he hated Tiffany once, and right before he left to go over there, he was talking about hurting her, but I didn't think anything of it.""
[Message 28] SARAH: ""Woah, Anna! You need to tell the police that. Like, now. That’s important, about Jake and his ring.""
[Message 29] ANNA: ""I guess…it just seemed like drunken rambling at the time.""
[Message 30] MARK: ""Don't jump to conclusions. Everyone says things they don't mean.""
[Message 31] SARAH: ""Mark's right, but Anna should still mention it. Just in case.""
[Message 32] ANNA: ""Okay, okay. I'll call them tomorrow.""
[Message 33] MARK: ""So, what are you guys doing tonight? Trying to forget about all this?""
[Message 34] SARAH: ""Pretty much. Drinks at my place?""

[Message 42] MARK: ""Just…wondering if you might have misheard. Things get loud in the club.""
[Message 43] ANNA: ""I didn't mishear, Mark. He was angry.""
[Message 44] MARK: ""Right. Just thinking out loud.""
[Message 45] SARAH: ""Anna, I think you should also tell them that Jake was always buying Asphyxiation by strangulation at the store down the street.""
[Message 46] ANNA: ""True, I saw that too.""

[Message 50] JAKE: ""I was there earlier. Had a drink. Left before it got dark. Honest.""
[Message 51] MARK: ""Hey Anna, Detective Jenkins called me. Asked me about the club.""
[Message 52] ANNA: ""What did you tell him?""
[Message 53] MARK: ""Said I was there, saw Leo, didn't see Tiffany. Kept it simple.""
[Message 54] ANNA: ""Did he ask about Jake?""
[Message 55] MARK: ""Yeah, mentioned he was a person of interest. Said something about you overhearing something.""
[Message 56] ANNA: ""I told them everything.""
[Message 57] MARK: ""Good.""
[Message 58] SARAH: ""Hey Anna, heard Jake got arrested?""
[Message 59] ANNA: ""Really?! For what?""
[Message 60] SARAH: ""Double homicide, duh. They must have found something.""
[Message 61] ANNA: ""Wow. I can't believe it. I was so sure about him.""
[Message 62] MARK: ""Hopefully, they're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 63] ANNA: ""Yeah, me too. So awful.""
[Message 64] MARK: ""I heard he always hated Tiffany, he was aware that his romantic intrests were ignored.""
[Message 65] ANNA: ""That's messed up! I can't believe I knew a murderer.""
[Message 66] SARAH: ""You didn't *know* him, Anna. You just knew of him. Big difference.""
[Message 67] ANNA: ""Yeah, you're right.""
[Message 68] MARK: ""He was looking up how to make Asphyxiation by strangulation online""

418,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Hey everyone! Anyone thinking about checking out the Virginia Beach Craft Brew Fest next weekend?""
[Message 2] Jordan: ""Craft Brew Fest? Sounds interesting, Alex! What kind of brews are we talking?""
[Message 3] Sam: ""I've heard good things about it, Jordan. Apparently, a lot of local breweries will be there.""
[Message 4] Chris: ""Hmm, craft beer... I'm not a huge beer person, but I'm always up for something new. Is there food?""
[Message 5] Taylor: ""Definitely food, Chris! They usually have food trucks and vendors. It's a whole vibe.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Yeah, lots of good food, Chris. I'm thinking about going on Saturday. Anyone else interested?""
[Message 7] Jordan: ""Saturday sounds doable. What time were you thinking, Alex?""
[Message 8] Sam: ""I might be able to swing Saturday. Depends on if I get called in for overtime. I'll let you know.""
[Message 9] Chris: ""I'll tentatively say yes. Need to check my schedule, but I'm leaning towards it.""
[Message 10] Taylor: ""Count me in! I've been wanting to try that new IPA from Back Bay Brewing.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Awesome! Let's aim for around 2 PM? We can meet at the entrance.""
[Message 12] Jordan: ""2 PM works for me. I'll set a reminder.""
[Message 13] Sam: ""Sounds good. I'll update you all Friday.""
[Message 14] Chris: ""Perfect. If I can't make it, I'll let you know by Friday morning.""
[Message 15] Taylor: ""Great! Looking forward to it!""
[Message 16] Alex: ""Speaking of schedules, anyone have teacher-student conferences coming up? My daughter's is next week.""
[Message 17] Jordan: ""Oh yeah, my nephew has one next month. Those can be stressful.""
[Message 18] Sam: ""I remember those. It's good to know how they're doing, but can also be nerve-wracking.""
[Message 19] Chris: ""They're usually just trying to sell you something you don't need, aren't they?""
[Message 20] Taylor: ""Haha, sometimes Chris! But it's also a good chance to connect with the teachers and get a better understanding of what they're learning.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Exactly, Taylor. I just want to make sure she's on track. It's high school now, so it's getting serious.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""Time flies, doesn't it? Seems like yesterday my nephew was starting kindergarten.""
[Message 23] Sam: ""Tell me about it. My grandkids are all grown up now. Where does the time go?""
[Message 24] Chris: ""It all blurs together, honestly. Like one long, continuous Monday.""
[Message 25] Taylor: ""Haha, true for some! But I try to find the good in each day.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""That's a good attitude to have, Taylor. So, back to the Brew Fest... anyone have a designated driver?""
[Message 27] Jordan: ""Good point, Alex. I can drive. I'm not much of a drinker anyway.""
[Message 28] Sam: ""That's very generous of you, Jordan!""
[Message 29] Chris: ""Thanks, Jordan. You're a lifesaver. Literally.""
[Message 30] Taylor: ""Yes, thank you, Jordan! That makes things much easier.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Excellent! Thanks, Jordan. That settles it, then. Brew Fest on Saturday at 2 PM, Jordan's driving. Perfect!""
[Message 32] Jordan: ""You got it! Happy to help.""
[Message 33] Sam: ""Okay, I'm officially off work Saturday! So, count me in for the Brew Fest.""
[Message 34] Chris: ""Great news, Sam! The more the merrier.""
[Message 35] Taylor: ""Yay, Sam! Glad you can make it!""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Fantastic, Sam! It's going to be a blast.""
[Message 37] Jordan: ""Awesome! Looking forward to it.""
[Message 38] Sam: ""Me too! Haven't been out in a while.""
[Message 39] Chris: ""Same here. It'll be good to get out of the house.""
[Message 40] Taylor: ""Definitely! We all need a little fun sometimes.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""So true. Speaking of getting out... anyone been to that new escape room downtown?""
[Message 42] Jordan: ""Escape room? No, I haven't. Are they any good?""
[Message 43] Sam: ""I've heard mixed reviews. Some people love them, some people find them frustrating.""
[Message 44] Chris: ""Sounds like another way to waste money, to be honest.""
[Message 45] Taylor: ""I think they can be fun, Chris! It's a good way to challenge yourself and work as a team.""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Yeah, I've been wanting to try one. Maybe we could do one sometime?""
[Message 47] Jordan: ""I'm open to it. As long as it's not too scary.""
[Message 48] Sam: ""I'd be willing to give it a shot.""
[Message 49] Chris: ""Ugh, fine. But don't expect me to be enthusiastic.""
[Message 50] Taylor: ""Haha, we won't, Chris! We'll just be happy to have you.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Okay, maybe we can look into some different escape rooms and see what everyone's interested in. After the Brew Fest, of course.""
[Message 52] Jordan: ""Sounds like a plan! I'll do some research.""
[Message 53] Sam: ""Great! I'm up for anything.""
[Message 54] Chris: ""Just make sure it's not too complicated. I don't want to be stuck in there all day.""
[Message 55] Taylor: ""Don't worry, Chris. We'll find one that's not too challenging.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""Perfect! This is shaping up to be a fun few weeks.""
[Message 57] Jordan: ""Definitely. It's good to have things to look forward to.""
[Message 58] Sam: ""Agreed. It makes the work week go by faster.""
[Message 59] Chris: ""If you say so. I still think every day is Monday.""
[Message 60] Taylor: ""Haha! You're incorrigible, Chris.""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Okay, I'm going to run to the grocery store. Need anything, anyone?""
[Message 62] Jordan: ""I'm good, thanks Alex.""
[Message 63] Sam: ""No, thank you. I'm all set.""
[Message 64] Chris: ""Just get me a good stiff drink.""
[Message 65] Taylor: ""Haha, Chris! He's kidding, Alex. I don't need anything either.""
[Message 66] Alex: ""Okay, back in a bit!""
[Message 67] Jordan: ""Safe travels!""
[Message 68] Sam: ""Have a good trip!""
[Message 69] Chris: ""Don't forget the ice cream.""
[Message 70] Taylor: ""Haha! Bye, Alex!""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Okay, I'm back! Got some ice cream, Chris. Just for you.""
[Message 72] Jordan: ""Haha! You shouldn't have, Alex.""
[Message 73] Sam: ""You're too kind, Alex.""
[Message 74] Chris: ""Finally, someone understands my needs. Thanks.""
[Message 75] Taylor: ""You're a good friend, Alex.""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Just trying to keep everyone happy! So, back to the escape room... any preferences on themes?""
[Message 77] Jordan: ""Maybe something tech-related? Since I'm into that.""
[Message 78] Sam: ""I'd prefer something not too scary. Maybe a mystery theme?""
[Message 79] Chris: ""Anything but zombies. I hate zombies.""
[Message 80] Taylor: ""Ooh, a mystery theme sounds fun! I'm good with that.""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Okay, mystery it is! I'll look for some mystery-themed escape rooms in the area.""
[Message 82] Jordan: ""Sounds great! Let me know what you find.""
[Message 83] Sam: ""Looking forward to it!""
[Message 84] Chris: ""Just don't let us get locked in there forever.""
[Message 85] Taylor: ""Haha, we won't, Chris! We'll make sure to escape in time.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Of course! We're a team, we'll figure it out.""
[Message 87] Jordan: ""Teamwork makes the dream work!""
[Message 88] Sam: ""Exactly! We can do this.""
[Message 89] Chris: ""I still have my doubts, but okay.""
[Message 90] Taylor: ""Have a little faith, Chris! It'll be fun.""
[Message 91] Alex: ""Okay, I'm going to start looking for escape rooms now. I'll send some links around later.""
[Message 92] Jordan: ""Sounds good! Thanks for organizing, Alex.""
[Message 93] Sam: ""Appreciate it, Alex!""
[Message 94] Chris: ""Whatever. Just find a decent one.""
[Message 95] Taylor: ""Thanks, Alex! You're the best.""
[Message 96] Alex: ""No problem! Happy to do it. Okay, talk to you all later!""
[Message 97] Jordan: ""Later, Alex!""
[Message 98] Sam: ""Bye, Alex!""
[Message 99] Chris: ""Goodbye.""
[Message 100] Taylor: ""Bye, Alex!""
[Message 101] Jordan: ""Anyone watching anything good on TV lately?""
[Message 102] Chris: ""Everything's terrible. They keep remaking shows that were already good.""
[Message 103] Sam: ""I've been enjoying that new baking show on Netflix. It's very wholesome.""
[Message 104] Taylor: ""Oh, I've heard about that! I'll have to check it out. I'm currently obsessed with 'The Crown.'""
[Message 105] Jordan: ""I’ve been playing around with a new AI art generator. It’s pretty wild what it can do.""
[Message 106] Chris: ""AI is going to take over the world. Mark my words.""
[Message 107] Taylor: ""Haha! Don't be such a pessimist, Chris. It's just a tool.""
[Message 108] Sam: ""I agree with Taylor. It can be used for good things too.""
[Message 109] Jordan: ""Exactly! And it's fascinating to see how technology is evolving.""
[Message 110] Chris: ""Still don't trust it.""
[Message 111] Taylor: ""You're allowed to have your opinion, Chris! We still love you.""
[Message 112] Sam: ""Yes, we do!""
[Message 113] Jordan: ""Absolutely!""
[Message 114] Chris: ""Whatever.""
[Message 115] Taylor: ""So, back to the baking show, Sam... what's it called?""
[Message 116] Sam: ""It's called 'The Great British Baking Show.' It's very comforting to watch.""
[Message 117] Taylor: ""I'll definitely check it out! Thanks for the recommendation.""
[Message 118] Sam: ""You're welcome! I think you'll enjoy it.""
[Message 119] Jordan: ""Alright, well, I should probably get going. It was nice chatting with everyone!""

419,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey, you hear about what happened at Nightclub?
[Message 2] Jamie: No, what's up?
[Message 3] Alex: Someone got killed. Brutal, apparently.
[Message 4] Jamie: Seriously? At Nightclub? Wow.
[Message 5] Alex: Yeah, pretty messed up.
[Message 6] Jamie: Who was it? Anyone we know?
[Message 7] Alex: 6.  Drug Dealer, goes by River.
[Message 8] Jamie: River? Damn, I knew River. Sold me stuff a few times.
[Message 9] Alex: Police said it was Blunt force trauma with a hammer.
[Message 10] Jamie: That's horrific. Any suspects?
[Message 11] Alex: Rumor is they're looking at Kai. I heard Kai didn't like River.
[Message 12] Jamie: Kai? Really? I know Kai. What’s the motive?
[Message 13] Alex: Apparently, some kind of political motive.
[Message 14] Jamie: Political? River was a drug dealer, not a politician. Doesn’t add up.
[Message 15] Alex: That's what I thought too.
[Message 16] Jamie: Did they catch Kai?
[Message 17] Alex: Not yet, but they’re questioning everyone who was at Nightclub.
[Message 18] Jamie: I wasn't even there that night. Thank god.
[Message 19] Alex: Lucky you.
[Message 20] Jamie: I was at home, watching that dumb reality show.
[Message 21] Alex: Which one?
[Message 22] Jamie: ""Housewives of Flint"". Don’t judge.
[Message 23] Alex: No judgement here. So, you’re good then, right?
[Message 24] Jamie: Yeah, I'm clear. Just shaken up about River.
[Message 25] Alex: Me too.
[Message 26] Kai: Hey Alex, you heard anything new?
[Message 27] Alex: About River? Just that the cops are still investigating.
[Message 28] Kai: They haven't contacted me yet.
[Message 29] Alex: Maybe they don’t think you were involved.
[Message 30] Kai: Hope so. This whole thing is crazy.
[Message 31] Alex: Yeah, it is. You at Nightclub that night?
[Message 32] Kai: Yeah, I was. Left around Late Evening. Saw River dealing.
[Message 33] Alex: Did you talk to River?
[Message 34] Kai: Briefly. Just a quick hello.
[Message 35] Alex: Anything seem off?
[Message 36] Kai: No, River seemed normal. You know, as normal as River gets.
[Message 37] Alex: Right.
[Message 38] Kai: I always thought River was trying to get rich quick.
[Message 39] Alex: Maybe someone got tired of River’s hustle.
[Message 40] Kai: Could be. The city is full of them.
[Message 41] Alex: You got any enemies, Kai?
[Message 42] Kai: Who doesn't? But nothing serious enough to get me involved in murder.
[Message 43] Alex: Good point.
[Message 44] Kai: I'm just trying to lay low until this blows over.
[Message 45] Alex: Smart move.
[Message 46] Kai: This could be a great opportunity for a political assassination.
[Message 47] Alex: What do you mean?
[Message 48] Kai: Nothing. Forget I said anything.
[Message 49] Alex: Okay…
[Message 50] Sarah: Hey Jamie, you okay? You seemed quiet earlier.
[Message 51] Jamie: Just thinking about River. It’s awful.
[Message 52] Sarah: I know. I heard about it.
[Message 53] Jamie: I can’t believe someone would do that.
[Message 54] Sarah: Me neither. Was River messing with the wrong people?
[Message 55] Jamie: Probably. It's a shame, though. River was so optimistic.
[Message 56] Sarah: Yeah, I remember.
[Message 57] Jamie: Did you know River well?
[Message 58] Sarah: Not really. Just saw River around.
[Message 59] Jamie: I heard Kai and River didn't get along.
[Message 60] Sarah: Really? Why not?
[Message 61] Jamie: Something about River owing Kai money.
[Message 62] Sarah: That could be a motive. But Kai is kinda scary too.
[Message 63] Jamie: I agree.
[Message 64] Sarah: You think Kai did it?
[Message 65] Jamie: I don’t know what to think.
[Message 66] Sarah: Just stay safe.
[Message 67] Jamie: You too.
[Message 68] Detective Miller: Mr. Kai, can you come down to the station?
[Message 69] Kai: What for?
[Message 70] Detective Miller: We have some questions about the River situation.
[Message 71] Kai: Do I need a lawyer?
[Message 72] Detective Miller: That’s up to you. But we'd appreciate your cooperation.
[Message 73] Kai: Fine. When?
[Message 74] Detective Miller: As soon as possible.
[Message 75] Kai: Okay, I'll be there in an hour.
[Message 76] Alex: You alright, Kai? I saw a detective message you.
[Message 77] Kai: Yeah, they want to talk to me about River.
[Message 78] Alex: You lawyering up?
[Message 79] Kai: Nah, I got nothing to hide.
[Message 80] Alex: That’s the spirit. Just tell them the truth.
[Message 81] Kai: Exactly. I told you, I left Nightclub at Late Evening.
[Message 82] Alex: That's right.
[Message 83] Kai: This is so stupid. I inherited money, and that’s the life.
[Message 84] Alex: It’ll be over soon.
[Message 85] Kai: Hope so.
[Message 86] Jamie: Hey Sarah, you won't believe this.
[Message 87] Sarah: What? Spill.
[Message 88] Jamie: I saw Kai buying a hammer at the hardware store yesterday.
[Message 89] Sarah: A hammer? Seriously?
[Message 90] Jamie: Yeah! And I remember Kai was saying ""I really hated River"".
[Message 91] Sarah: That's… concerning.
[Message 92] Jamie: I know, right?
[Message 93] Sarah: Did you tell the police?
[Message 94] Jamie: No, not yet. Should I?
[Message 95] Sarah: Definitely. That’s important information.
[Message 96] Jamie: Okay, I will. I just don't want to get involved.
[Message 97] Sarah: You’re doing the right thing. It might help catch the killer.
[Message 98] Jamie: I guess so.
[Message 99] Sarah: It's scary, I know.
[Message 100] Jamie: Very. I hope they don't get the death penalty, if they did it.
[Message 101] Detective Miller: Ms. Jamie, we'd like to ask you some questions.
[Message 102] Jamie: About River?
[Message 103] Detective Miller: Yes. Can you come down to the station?
[Message 104] Jamie: Sure.
[Message 105] Detective Miller: Great. See you soon.
[Message 106] Jamie: What if they think I did it?
[Message 107] Sarah: Just tell them the truth. You were at home watching TV, right?
[Message 108] Jamie: Yeah, but what if they don't believe me?
[Message 109] Sarah: They will. You have nothing to worry about.
[Message 110] Jamie: Okay.
[Message 111] Sarah: Let me know how it goes.
[Message 112] Jamie: Will do. Thanks, Sarah.
[Message 113] Alex: Hear anything from Kai?
[Message 114] Jamie: No, but the cops called me in too.
[Message 115] Alex: Really? What did they ask?
[Message 116] Jamie: Just about River and if I knew anything.
[Message 117] Alex: Did you tell them about Kai buying the hammer?
[Message 118] Jamie: Yep. And I mentioned River probably did something to deserve it.
[Message 119] Alex: Good.
[Message 120] Jamie: I hope they catch the person who did this.
[Message 121] Alex: Me too.
[Message 122] Kai: They are checking store security cameras.
[Message 123] Alex: Checking what now?
[Message 124] Kai: They said they know someone saw me leave the building.
[Message 125] Alex: So? You did leave the building.
[Message 126] Kai: But I didn't do anything!
[Message 127] Alex: Just tell them what happened and when. They will believe that you left at Late Evening.
[Message 128] Kai: I did go to the store to buy some candy
[Message 129] Alex: That's all you have to say.
[Message 130] Jamie: They seemed to think Kai knew about the murder ahead of time.
[Message 131] Sarah: Really? What makes them think that?
[Message 132] Jamie: They didn't say, but they kept asking if Kai had mentioned anything weird.
[Message 133] Sarah: That's suspicious.
[Message 134] Jamie: I know. It feels like they're trying to build a case.
[Message 135] Sarah: Well, just stick to the truth.
[Message 136] Jamie: I am. I told them Kai left Nightclub right before the murder happened.
[Message 137] Sarah: Just be careful, okay?
[Message 138] Jamie: Will do.
[Message 139] Alex: So, what happens now?
[Message 140] Kai: I don't know. They didn't arrest me, but they're not letting me leave town either.
[Message 141] Alex: That sucks.
[Message 142] Kai: I'm starting to think I need a lawyer.
[Message 143] Alex: Probably a good idea.
[Message 144] Kai: This whole thing is a nightmare.
[Message 145] Alex: Just hang in there.
[Message 146] Kai: Easier said than done.
[Message 147] Alex: You’ll get through it.
[Message 148] Kai: Thanks, Alex.
[Message 149] Jamie: I heard they're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 150] Sarah: Yeah, that's what they do with murder cases.
[Message 151] Jamie: Hopefully, they can prove that Kai is guilty.
[Message 152] Sarah: Justice needs to be served.
[Message 153] Jamie: Absolutely.

[Message 4] David: Tony? No way! I used to take his cab all the time. He was always cracking jokes.

[Message 5] Omar: Yeah, and apparently some journalist kid too. Some say his name was Ethan.

[Message 6] Jen: A journalist? Maybe he was digging into something he shouldn’t have been.

[Message 7] Maria: That’s what I was thinking! Dangerous job.

[Message 8] David: Seriously messed up. Hope they catch whoever did it.

[Message 9] Omar: You know that place is always shady at Late Evening. I try to avoid Street Corner.

[Message 10] Jen: Tell me about it. Remember that time we saw Benny arguing with Tony last week?

[Message 11] Maria: Yeah, what was that about? Benny looked pissed.

[Message 12] David: Benny always looks pissed. Probably just a fare dispute.

[Message 13] Omar: Benny owes me money. Always dodging me.

[Message 14] Jen: Guys, seriously. Two people are dead. Let's not speculate.

[Message 15] Maria: Just saying, Benny's got a temper.

[Message 16] David: I saw Kelly at the hardware store yesterday buying a Blunt force trauma with a hammer. Just thought it was for home improvement.

[Message 17] Omar: Kelly? Really? She’s always seemed so nice.

[Message 18] Jen: Maybe she’s finally fixing up that old house of hers. Remember how she was complaining it was falling apart?

[Message 19] Maria: Still seems weird. A Blunt force trauma with a hammer is pretty intense for fixing a leaky faucet.

[Message 20] David: True, but I did see her struggling with some drywall last month.

[Message 21] Omar: Anyone know Ethan? Was he a friend of anyone here?

[Message 22] Jen: Never heard of him.

[Message 30] Jen: No, haven't seen her.

[Message 31] Maria: You guys are still fighting?

[Message 32] David: Guys, back to the point. Two people are dead. It's messed up.

[Message 33] Omar: I know, I know. Just trying to distract myself.

[Message 34] Jen: Did the news say anything about a possible motive?

[Message 35] Maria: They said they’re looking into all possibilities. Drug deal gone wrong, robbery, everything.

[Message 36] David: Robbery? Tony never had much cash.

[Message 37] Omar: Maybe Ethan had something valuable.

[Message 38] Jen: Could be. Or maybe it was personal. Someone had a grudge.

[Message 39] Maria: Remember how Tony fired Benny from his taxi service a few weeks ago?

[Message 40] David: Yeah, he did seem pretty upset about that.

[Message 41] Omar: Benny needs to get his act together.

[Message 42] Jen: Guys, let’s not jump to conclusions. The police are investigating.

[Message 43] Maria: You're right, you're right.

[Message 44] David: Still can't believe it about Tony. He was a good guy.

[Message 45] Omar: A lot of good people die young. That kid Ethan, too.

[Message 53] Jen: No, haven't spoken to either of them.

[Message 54] Maria: Same here.

[Message 55] David: Me neither. Maybe they're just freaked out like the rest of us.

[Message 56] Omar: You think they know something?

[Message 57] Jen: Don’t start again, Omar.

[Message 65] Jen: Who told you that, Omar?

[Message 66] Maria: Yeah, spill.

[Message 31] Ava: ""Important how?""
[Message 32] Noah: ""Wouldn't say. Just said...""
[Message 33] Chloe: ""He can be secretive.""
[Message 34] Liam: ""Secrets are...""
[Message 35] Ava: ""Complicated.""
[Message 36] Noah: ""Anyone know what he was working on?""
[Message 37] Chloe: ""Something with the presentation, I think.""
[Message 38] Ava: ""Maybe.""
[Message 39] Liam: ""Presentation's...done.""
[Message 40] Noah: ""He seemed stressed.""
[Message 41] Chloe: ""Big day for him.""
[Message 42] Ava: ""Definitely a lot riding on it.""
[Message 43] Liam: ""Too much riding.""
[Message 44] Noah: ""What do you mean by that, Liam?""
[Message 45] Liam: ""Nothing. Just...""
[Message 46] Chloe: ""Ignore him. So, the weather is...""
[Message 47] Ava: ""Unpredictable.""
[Message 48] Noah: ""Has anyone tried the hotel restaurant?""
[Message 49] Chloe: ""It's alright. Overpriced, though.""
[Message 50] Ava: ""True. Lots of better options nearby.""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Outside is...""
[Message 52] Noah: ""What, Liam? Outside is what?""
[Message 53] Liam: ""Nothing, forget it.""
[Message 54] Chloe: ""He's just being Liam.""
[Message 55] Ava: ""He's always like this?""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Pretty much.""
[Message 57] Noah: ""I guess.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Don't...listen.""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""He doesn't mean anything by it.""
[Message 60] Ava: ""Okay.""
[Message 61] Noah: ""Did Mark mention anything about leaving early?""
[Message 62] Chloe: ""Not to me.""
[Message 63] Ava: ""He seemed committed to seeing it through.""
[Message 64] Liam: ""See...through?""
[Message 65] Noah: ""Yes, seeing the conference through.""
[Message 66] Chloe: ""Why? Did he say something to you?""
[Message 67] Noah: ""Just wondering.""
[Message 68] Ava: ""He seemed excited.""
[Message 69] Liam: ""Excited...before.""
[Message 70] Noah: ""Before what, Liam?""
[Message 71] Liam: ""Before...""
[Message 72] Chloe: ""Before the presentation, probably.""
[Message 73] Ava: ""Makes sense.""
[Message 74] Noah: ""Maybe.""
[Message 75] Liam: ""Nothing makes...""
[Message 76] Chloe: ""Anything?""
[Message 77] Ava: ""Almost there.""
[Message 78] Noah: ""Thank goodness, this elevator is slow.""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Slow...is good.""
[Message 80] Chloe: ""Not when you're in a hurry.""
[Message 81] Ava: ""Or stuck.""
[Message 82] Noah: ""Stuck would be awful.""
[Message 83] Liam: ""Stuck...is fate.""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""Don't be dramatic, Liam.""
[Message 85] Ava: ""Agreed.""
[Message 86] Noah: ""So, anyone planning on staying the whole week?""
[Message 87] Chloe: ""Just for today.""
[Message 88] Ava: ""Same here.""
[Message 89] Liam: ""Gone...soon.""
[Message 90] Noah: ""You leaving soon, Liam?""
[Message 91] Liam: ""Have...to.""

[Message 93] Liam: ""Something...like that.""
[Message 94] Ava: ""Well, safe travels.""
[Message 95] Liam: ""Safe...""

[Message 97] Chloe: ""Ignore him.""
[Message 98] Ava: ""Sure.""
[Message 99] Noah: ""Hope Mark's alright.""
[Message 100] Chloe: ""He'll be fine.""
[Message 101] Ava: ""Probably just running late.""
[Message 102] Liam: ""Late...""
[Message 103] Noah: ""Yes, late. Like people are sometimes.""

427,"[Message 1] Ben: ""Hey guys, did you hear about what happened at Office Building last night?""
[Message 2] Chloe: ""Yeah, it's all over the news. Horrible.""
[Message 3] David: ""Seriously messed up. Who was it?""
[Message 4] Ben: ""It was Kai. 22 years old. Worked as a taxi driver apparently.""
[Message 5] Esther: ""Oh my god, no way! I took a taxi from her last week. She was so nice...""
[Message 6] Frank: ""Never met her. What happened?""
[Message 7] Ben: ""Murdered. Lethal injection, they're saying.""
[Message 8] Chloe: ""Lethal injection? That's... specific. Sounds like someone knew what they were doing.""
[Message 9] David: ""Yeah, that's not random. Who would do something like that?""
[Message 10] Esther: ""I can't even imagine. I feel so bad for their family.""
[Message 11] Frank: ""Anyone know why? Was it robbery gone wrong?""
[Message 12] Ben: ""No details yet. Just that it happened at Office Building in Dead of Night.""
[Message 13] Chloe: ""Office Building? That's close to my work. Creepy.""
[Message 14] David: ""Tell me about it. I have a friend who works in that building.""
[Message 15] Esther: ""I hope they catch whoever did this quickly.""
[Message 16] Frank: ""Me too. People like that shouldn't be walking free.""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Agreed. Makes you think twice about everything.""
[Message 18] Chloe: ""So true. Anyway, I gotta run. Meeting in 10. Talk later.""
[Message 19] David: ""Catch you later, Chloe.""
[Message 20] Esther: ""Bye Chloe!""
[Message 21] Frank: ""See ya.""
[Message 22] Ben: ""Bye.""
[Message 23] David: ""Anyone know if Kai had any enemies?""
[Message 24] Esther: ""I have no idea. I barely knew her.""
[Message 25] Frank: ""I've never even heard of her before today.""
[Message 26] Ben: ""Heard she was a bit cynical, but nothing crazy.""
[Message 27] David: ""Cynical? What does that even mean?""
[Message 28] Esther: ""Like, maybe a bit negative or sarcastic. Not necessarily a reason to kill someone.""
[Message 29] Frank: ""Exactly. People are cynical all the time.""
[Message 30] Ben: ""True. Just repeating what I heard.""
[Message 31] David: ""I heard Kai had some beef with his boss. A guy named Victor.""
[Message 32] Esther: ""Oh really? What kind of beef?""
[Message 33] Frank: ""That's interesting. Maybe the boss did it?""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Could be. Though, isn't that too obvious?""
[Message 35] David: ""Victor fired Kai last month. Said he was underperforming.""
[Message 36] Esther: ""Wow, that's harsh. Still, murder seems extreme.""
[Message 37] Frank: ""Unless Victor really hated her.""
[Message 38] Ben: ""Maybe Victor intended to just scare Kai, and things escalated?""
[Message 39] David: ""I don't know, Frank. You seem to be siding with Victor a lot.""
[Message 40] Frank: ""I'm just playing devil's advocate. I didn't even know either of them.""
[Message 41] Esther: ""Guys, let's not start accusing each other. We should be focusing on finding the truth.""
[Message 42] Ben: ""Good point, Esther. Sorry, Frank.""
[Message 43] Frank: ""No worries, Ben. I understand.""
[Message 44] David: ""So, Victor fired Kai. That's our first lead. What else?""
[Message 45] Esther: ""Maybe Kai had a jealous lover? That's always a possibility.""
[Message 46] Frank: ""Could be. People do crazy things for love.""
[Message 47] Ben: ""Or money. Maybe Kai inherited something recently?""
[Message 48] David: ""I haven't heard anything about that.""
[Message 49] Esther: ""Me neither. But it's worth looking into.""
[Message 50] Frank: ""True. We should all do some digging.""
[Message 51] Ben: ""I'll see what I can find online.""
[Message 52] David: ""I can ask around at Office Building.""
[Message 53] Esther: ""I'll try to find some of Kai's friends on social media.""
[Message 54] Frank: ""I'll check the local news archives.""
[Message 55] Ben: ""Great! Let's meet back here tomorrow night to compare notes?""
[Message 56] David: ""Sounds good.""
[Message 57] Esther: ""Perfect.""
[Message 58] Frank: ""Alright.""
[Message 59] Ben: ""Okay, see you all tomorrow. Stay safe!""
[Message 60] David: ""You too, Ben.""
[Message 61] Esther: ""Bye!""
[Message 62] Frank: ""Later.""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""Hey guys, sorry I disappeared yesterday. That meeting ran super late.""
[Message 64] David: ""No worries, Chloe. We were just talking about Kai.""
[Message 65] Chloe: ""Oh yeah, that's awful. Any progress?""
[Message 66] Ben: ""We're digging around. Victor, the manager, seems like a possible suspect.""
[Message 67] Chloe: ""Victor? He seems like a nice guy. I've met him a couple of times.""
[Message 68] David: ""He fired Kai, Chloe. That gives him a motive.""
[Message 69] Chloe: ""True, but that doesn't mean he killed her. Maybe he just wanted her gone from the company.""
[Message 70] Esther: ""Has anyone talked to Victor?""
[Message 71] Frank: ""Not yet. We're trying to gather more info first.""
[Message 72] Ben: ""Yeah, we don't want to tip him off if he's guilty.""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Good point. Smart move.""
[Message 74] David: ""I did hear something interesting though. Apparently, Victor was furious with Kai for costing the company money.""
[Message 75] Chloe: ""Costing the company money? How?""
[Message 76] Esther: ""Maybe she made a mistake that lost them a big client?""
[Message 77] Frank: ""Or maybe she was stealing from them?""
[Message 78] Ben: ""That's a possibility. Theft could definitely be a motive.""
[Message 79] Chloe: ""I don't know, guys. I still find it hard to believe Victor is capable of murder.""
[Message 80] David: ""People are capable of anything, Chloe. Especially when money's involved.""
[Message 81] Esther: ""True. We shouldn't rule anyone out at this point.""
[Message 82] Frank: ""Exactly. We need to keep an open mind.""
[Message 83] Ben: ""Alright, let's focus on gathering more evidence. Chloe, maybe you could ask around your workplace?""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""I can try, but I don't want to get involved too deeply. It's a bit too close to home.""
[Message 85] David: ""I understand. Just be careful.""
[Message 86] Esther: ""Yeah, don't put yourself in danger.""
[Message 87] Frank: ""Agreed. Your safety is more important.""
[Message 88] Ben: ""Okay, everyone. Let's get back to work. I'll update you if I find anything new.""
[Message 89] Chloe: ""Sounds good.""
[Message 90] David: ""Alright.""
[Message 91] Esther: ""Bye!""
[Message 92] Frank: ""Later.""
[Message 93] Ben: ""Hey David, did you manage to ask around at Office Building?""
[Message 94] David: ""Yeah, I did. It's weird, nobody seems to know anything concrete. They're all acting like they're walking on eggshells.""
[Message 95] Ben: ""That's suspicious. Makes you think someone's hiding something.""
[Message 96] David: ""Exactly. I did hear a rumor that Kai was involved in some shady deals.""
[Message 97] Ben: ""Shady deals? Like what?""
[Message 98] David: ""I don't know the specifics. Just that it involved money and some potentially dangerous people.""
[Message 99] Ben: ""That's a whole new angle. Maybe Kai was in over her head.""
[Message 100] David: ""That's what I'm thinking. Maybe someone she crossed decided to take revenge.""
[Message 101] Ben: ""Did you hear anything about who these 'dangerous people' might be?""
[Message 102] David: ""No, nothing specific. Just whispers and rumors. People are scared to talk.""
[Message 103] Ben: ""Okay, that's definitely something to look into. Thanks for the info, David.""
[Message 104] David: ""No problem, Ben. Let's hope we can figure this out soon.""
[Message 105] Ben: ""Me too. Talk later.""
[Message 106] Frank: ""Hey Ben, I found something interesting in the news archives.""
[Message 107] Ben: ""What is it, Frank?""
[Message 108] Frank: ""Apparently, Victor's company was under investigation for fraud a few years ago. Nothing came of it, but it's definitely worth noting.""
[Message 109] Ben: ""Fraud? Wow. That makes Victor look even more suspicious.""
[Message 110] Frank: ""Exactly. It shows that he's not afraid to bend the rules, or maybe even break them.""
[Message 111] Ben: ""Good find, Frank. This is definitely a piece of the puzzle.""
[Message 112] Frank: ""I also found a small article about Victor's wife having a serious gambling problem. She's in debt to some pretty nasty people.""
[Message 113] Ben: ""Damn. So Victor could have been desperate for money.""
[Message 114] Frank: ""Possibly. Maybe he thought Kai was skimming money from the company and decided to take matters into his own hands.""
[Message 115] Ben: ""That's a strong possibility. This is getting more complicated by the minute.""
[Message 116] Frank: ""Tell me about it. We need to be careful about who we trust.""
[Message 117] Ben: ""Agreed. Thanks for the research, Frank. I appreciate it.""
[Message 118] Frank: ""No problem, Ben. Glad I could help.""
[Message 119] Esther: ""Hey guys, I found something on Kai's social media. He was arguing with someone online a few weeks ago. Someone using the name 'Justice4All'.""
[Message 120] Ben: ""Justice4All? That sounds like a revenge thing.""
[Message 121] Esther: ""Yeah, it does. I tried to dig deeper, but the account is private. I can't see who's behind it.""
[Message 122] Ben: ""Damn it. That could be our killer.""
[Message 123] Esther: ""I know, right? I wish I could find out who it is.""
[Message 124] Ben: ""Maybe we can try to trace the IP address? Or find out who Justice4All is connected to.""
[Message 125] Esther: ""That's a good idea. I'll see what I can do.""
[Message 126] Ben: ""Thanks, Esther. You're a lifesaver.""
[Message 127] Esther: ""No problem. I just want to see justice for Kai.""
[Message 128] Ben: ""Me too. Talk later.""
[Message 129] Chloe: ""Guys, I overheard something at work today that might be relevant.""
[Message 130] Ben: ""What did you hear, Chloe?""
[Message 131] Chloe: ""Apparently, Victor was seen buying Administering a lethal injection at the store a few days before Kai's death.""
[Message 132] Ben: ""WHAT?! Buying Administering a lethal injection? That's huge!""
[Message 133] Chloe: ""I know, right? But the person who told me swore me to secrecy. They don't want to get involved.""
[Message 134] Ben: ""We understand. But this changes everything. Victor purposefully set out to hurt Kai.""
[Message 135] Chloe: ""Exactly. I think he planned this all along.""
[Message 136] Ben: ""Okay, we need to tell the police about this immediately. This is solid evidence.""
[Message 137] Chloe: ""I agree. But be careful. Victor is dangerous.""
[Message 138] Ben: ""We will be. Thanks for telling us, Chloe. You did the right thing.""
[Message 139] Chloe: ""I hope so. I feel terrible about all of this.""
[Message 140] Ben: ""Don't. You helped us get closer to the truth. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 141] Chloe: ""I just hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 142] Ben: ""Let the justice system decide that. We need to focus on catching Victor and bringing him to justice.""
[Message 143] Chloe: ""Okay, Ben. You're right.""
[Message 144] Ben: ""Alright, everyone. Let's work together and make sure Victor pays for what he did.""
[Message 145] Ben: ""Thanks everyone for all your help. I have notified the police, they will handle it from here. """,1,
428,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Hey Jamie! You free to chat for a bit? Thinking about games.""
[Message 2] Jamie: ""Hey Alex! Sure, what's up? Games like video games?""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Yeah, or board games, anything really. Trying to decide what to do this weekend.""
[Message 4] Jamie: ""Ah, I see. I'm not much of a gamer myself, but I can offer moral support!""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Haha, I appreciate it! Any recommendations for something easy to pick up? Maybe for a group?""
[Message 6] Jamie: ""Hmm, for a group... Cards Against Humanity can be fun, if your group's sense of humor is... dark.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Dark humor is definitely present! Played that one a few times. Anything a little less... edgy?""
[Message 8] Jamie: ""Okay, how about Codenames? That's good for teams and involves some clever wordplay.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Codenames! I've heard good things. I think my niece mentioned it. Might be worth a shot.""
[Message 10] Jamie: ""Yeah, it's pretty popular. Relatively easy to learn too. Less than 10 minutes, I'd guess.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""That's perfect. Don't want anything too complicated. I'm trying to get my sister involved, and she's not exactly a strategy game enthusiast.""
[Message 12] Jamie: ""Makes sense. So, what about video games? Anything you've been playing lately?""
[Message 13] Alex: ""I've been trying to get back into Stardew Valley. It's so relaxing, but I haven't had much time lately.""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""Oh, I know Stardew Valley! My cousin is obsessed. She spends hours farming those virtual parsnips.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""It's surprisingly addictive! But yeah, time is the issue. Thinking of maybe getting something on my phone to play on the go.""
[Message 16] Jamie: ""Plenty of options there. Wordscapes is pretty good for a quick brain workout. Or Candy Crush, if you're into that kind of thing.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Candy Crush is a bit too much for me, I think. Wordscapes sounds interesting, though. I'll check it out.""
[Message 18] Jamie: ""Cool. Speaking of checking things out, how was that wedding reception you went to last weekend?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Oh! It was lovely. The food was great, and the music was fun. Though, my feet were killing me by the end of the night!""
[Message 20] Jamie: ""Ah, the price we pay for looking good on the dance floor! Glad you had a good time.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Haha, exactly! So, back to games... any thoughts on console games? Thinking of maybe investing in a Switch.""
[Message 22] Jamie: ""A Switch is a solid choice. Lots of variety, and it's portable. Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a must-play if you get one.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Zelda, huh? I've always been a little intimidated by those games. Seem so involved.""
[Message 24] Jamie: ""It is, but it's worth it. The world is beautiful, and the gameplay is really rewarding. You can take it at your own pace.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Hmm, maybe I'll watch some gameplay videos and see if it's something I'd enjoy.""
[Message 26] Jamie: ""Good idea. There are tons of reviews and playthroughs on YouTube. That's how I decide on most games.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Smart! I'm a bit old-fashioned. Usually just go by word-of-mouth.""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""Nothing wrong with that! Word-of-mouth is often the best way to find hidden gems.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""True. Okay, so, Codenames, Wordscapes, maybe a Switch with Zelda... I have some options now!""
[Message 30] Jamie: ""Glad I could help! Let me know what you decide on, and if you like it.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Definitely! Thanks for the suggestions, Jamie. You're a lifesaver.""
[Message 32] Jamie: ""Any time, Alex! Always happy to procrastinate by talking about games.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Haha! Procrastination well spent. I should probably get back to work now.""
[Message 34] Jamie: ""Same here. Have a good one!""
[Message 35] Alex: ""You too!""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Hey Jamie, quick question. Do you know anything about escape rooms? Thinking of trying one.""
[Message 37] Jamie: ""Escape rooms? Yeah, I've done a couple. They're a lot of fun, if you like puzzles and working as a team.""
[Message 38] Alex: ""That sounds right up my alley! Any recommendations in Kansas City?""
[Message 39] Jamie: ""Hmm, let me think. I went to one called 'Breakout KC' downtown, and it was pretty well done. Good atmosphere and challenging puzzles.""
[Message 40] Alex: ""Breakout KC... I'll look it up. Thanks! Are they scary at all?""
[Message 41] Jamie: ""Not really scary, more like suspenseful. They usually have different themes, so you can choose one that's not too intense.""
[Message 42] Alex: ""Good to know! I'm not a fan of jump scares or anything like that.""
[Message 43] Jamie: ""Me neither! I prefer the ones that are more about logic and problem-solving.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Exactly! Okay, I'm officially adding escape room to the weekend possibilities list.""
[Message 45] Jamie: ""Awesome! Let me know if you end up going, and how it was.""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Will do! Thanks again for all the advice.""
[Message 47] Jamie: ""No problem! Happy to enable your gaming habits.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""Haha! I appreciate that! You know me too well.""
[Message 49] Jamie: ""It's what I do! Now back to the grind for me.""
[Message 50] Alex: ""Yep, same here. Have a productive afternoon!""
[Message 51] Jamie: ""You too!""
[Message 52] Alex: ""So, I'm checking out Breakout KC... they have a room called 'Y2K.' Does that sound fun or terrifying?""
[Message 53] Jamie: ""Y2K? As in, the year 2000 bug? That actually sounds kind of cool! Nostalgic in a way.""
[Message 54] Alex: ""That's what I was thinking! But also, potentially filled with outdated technology that I won't understand.""
[Message 55] Jamie: ""Haha, fair point! But that could be part of the challenge, right? Figuring out how to use old computers and stuff.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""You make a good point. I might just be overthinking this.""
[Message 57] Jamie: ""Probably! Just go with your gut. Pick the one that sounds the most interesting.""
[Message 58] Alex: ""Alright, gut says Y2K. Let's hope my gut is right.""
[Message 59] Jamie: ""I have faith in your gut! Let me know if you need me to research any ancient computer technology for you.""
[Message 60] Alex: ""Haha! I might just take you up on that offer! I remember dial-up internet, but that's about the extent of my expertise.""
[Message 61] Jamie: ""Dial-up... those were the days. Or, you know, not.""
[Message 62] Alex: ""Definitely not! The sound of the modem connecting still haunts my dreams.""
[Message 63] Jamie: ""Oh god, me too! Okay, I need to stop reminiscing about outdated technology. I'm starting to feel old.""
[Message 64] Alex: ""Tell me about it! I'm practically ancient at this point.""
[Message 65] Jamie: ""Don't say that! You're only as old as you feel.""
[Message 66] Alex: ""True! And today, I feel like I'm 25... with a bad back.""
[Message 67] Jamie: ""Haha! I can relate. I feel like I'm 30... with the knees of an 80-year-old.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""We're a pair! Okay, officially booked the Y2K room for Saturday. Wish me luck!""
[Message 69] Jamie: ""Good luck! I'm sure you'll do great. And if you don't, at least you'll have a good story to tell.""
[Message 70] Alex: ""That's the spirit! Thanks, Jamie!""
[Message 71] Jamie: ""Anytime! Now get back to saving the world from the Y2K bug!""
[Message 72] Alex: ""On it! Talk to you later!""
[Message 73] Jamie: ""Later!""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Hey, random question... what's your favorite kind of hiking trail?""
[Message 75] Jamie: ""Oh, that's easy! Anything with a good view and some elevation changes. I love a challenge.""
[Message 76] Alex: ""I'm more of a leisurely stroll kind of hiker. Flat ground and maybe a bench or two.""
[Message 77] Jamie: ""Haha! To each their own! As long as you're enjoying the outdoors, that's all that matters.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""Exactly! I just like to be surrounded by nature without getting too out of breath.""
[Message 79] Jamie: ""I get that. Sometimes a nice, easy walk is exactly what you need.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Precisely! Okay, back to the gaming stuff... any thoughts on Mario Kart?""
[Message 81] Jamie: ""Mario Kart is a classic! Always a good choice for some friendly competition.""
[Message 82] Alex: ""That's what I was thinking! Everyone knows how to play, and it's always a good laugh.""
[Message 83] Jamie: ""Definitely! Just be prepared for some blue shell rage.""
[Message 84] Alex: ""Oh, I'm ready for the blue shell chaos! It's part of the fun, right?""
[Message 85] Jamie: ""Absolutely! It wouldn't be Mario Kart without the blue shells.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""True! Okay, Mario Kart is officially on the list as well.""
[Message 87] Jamie: ""Excellent choice! You're going to have a very busy weekend of gaming.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""I know! I'm already exhausted just thinking about it.""
[Message 89] Jamie: ""Haha! Just pace yourself. And remember to take breaks and hydrate!""
[Message 90] Alex: ""Good advice! I'll try to remember that.""
[Message 91] Jamie: ""Okay, I really need to get back to work now. My boss is giving me the stink eye.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""Oh no! Go, go, go! I'll let you get back to it.""
[Message 93] Jamie: ""Thanks! Talk to you later, Alex!""
[Message 94] Alex: ""Later, Jamie!""
[Message 95] Alex: ""One last thing, Jamie! What's your go-to snack for a gaming session?""
[Message 96] Jamie: ""Hmm, that's a tough one. Probably popcorn. It's easy to eat and not too messy.""
[Message 97] Alex: ""Popcorn is a solid choice! I'm more of a chips and dip kind of person.""
[Message 98] Jamie: ""Chips and dip are good too! But I tend to get dip all over my fingers when I'm gaming.""
[Message 99] Alex: ""Haha! That's a risk I'm willing to take! Okay, now I'm really done.""
[Message 100] Jamie: ""Alright! Happy snacking and gaming!""
[Message 101] Alex: ""Thanks! You too!""
[Message 102] Jamie: ""Wait! Actually, maybe trail mix. Healthy and easy to grab.""
[Message 103] Alex: ""Trail mix? You're changing your answer?! This is serious business!""
[Message 104] Jamie: ""I know, I know! I'm sorry! I'm just indecisive. Trail mix AND popcorn, maybe?""
[Message 105] Alex: ""Okay, now you're talking! A balanced gaming diet.""
[Message 106] Jamie: ""Exactly! Okay, NOW I'm really done. For real this time.""
[Message 107] Alex: ""Alright! I'm holding you to that! No more snack revisions!""
[Message 108] Jamie: ""Deal! See ya!""
[Message 109] Alex: ""See ya!""
[Message 110] Alex: ""Just kidding! One more thing... best dip for the chips?""
[Message 111] Jamie: ""Okay, you're killing me! Probably guacamole. Can't go wrong with guac.""
[Message 112] Alex: ""Guac is a great choice! I'm a big fan of french onion dip myself.""
[Message 113] Jamie: ""Ooh, french onion dip is good too! Okay, I'm officially hungry now.""
[Message 114] Alex: ""Me too! This gaming talk has made me ravenous.""
[Message 115] Jamie: ""Alright, I'm signing off! Enjoy your games and your snacks! Goodbye!""",0,
429,"[Message 1] Kai: ""Hey everyone, heard about what happened at Overpass last night? Crazy!""
[Message 2] Jamie: ""Yeah, the news is all over it. Two people dead… at Early Hours. Wild.""
[Message 3] Alex: ""I can't believe it. I was just there last week.""
[Message 4] Kai: ""I know, right? Makes you think.""
[Message 5] Jamie: ""Anyone know the victims?""
[Message 6] Alex: ""I think I saw the manager, Sarah, before. Always seemed nice.""
[Message 7] Kai: ""Apparently, one of them was a corrections officer. Someone named Mark.""
[Message 8] Jamie: ""Corrections officer? That's rough. Probably made some enemies.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Maybe it was a gang thing?""
[Message 10] Kai: ""Could be. Or just a random act of violence.""
[Message 11] Jamie: ""Greensboro's getting scarier every day.""
[Message 12] Alex: ""Tell me about it. I'm thinking of moving.""
[Message 13] Kai: ""Anyway, anyone up for pizza tonight to take our minds off it?""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""I'm in! Pizza sounds great.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Me too. Distraction is needed.""
[Message 16] Kai: ""Cool. 7 PM at Mario's?""
[Message 17] Jamie: ""Perfect. See you guys there.""
[Message 18] Alex: ""See ya.""
[Message 19] Kai: ""Later.""
[Message 20] Jamie: ""Did either of you know Sarah really well? She always gave me good service, I tipped her well too.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Nah, just saw her around. Never really talked to her.""
[Message 22] Kai: ""Same here. Friendly face, that's it.""
[Message 23] Jamie: ""Okay, just wondering. Something feels off about all this.""
[Message 24] Alex: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 25] Jamie: ""I don't know... Just a gut feeling. Maybe I've watched too many crime shows.""
[Message 26] Kai: ""Haha, could be. Don't go all detective on us now.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Yeah, leave it to the cops.""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""True, true. Pizza first, conspiracies later.""
[Message 29] Kai: ""Exactly!""
[Message 30] Alex: ""So, pizza confirmed?""
[Message 31] Jamie: ""Confirmed!""
[Message 32] Kai: ""Great! See you tonight.""
[Message 33] Jamie: ""Hey, did anyone else notice how Mark always seemed really stressed? Like he was hiding something?""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Now that you mention it, yeah. He did seem on edge a lot.""
[Message 35] Kai: ""Maybe work stress? Being a corrections officer can't be easy.""
[Message 36] Jamie: ""True, but it felt like more than that, you know? Like he knew he was always at risk.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Hmm, interesting. Maybe he had some beef with someone inside?""
[Message 38] Kai: ""Could be. Lots of possibilities.""
[Message 39] Jamie: ""Yeah, but what if he was planning something? Then he wouldn't have the time to hide evidence.""
[Message 40] Alex: ""Like what?""
[Message 41] Jamie: ""I don't know! Just spitballing. Maybe he was about to expose something and someone silenced him?""
[Message 42] Kai: ""Whoa, that's a bit extreme, don't you think?""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Yeah, Jamie, you're really going down the rabbit hole.""
[Message 44] Jamie: ""I know, I know. Sorry. Just thinking out loud.""
[Message 45] Kai: ""No worries. It's just… let's not jump to conclusions until we know more, okay?""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Agreed.""
[Message 47] Jamie: ""Fine, fine. Back to pizza.""
[Message 48] Kai: ""Good. Pizza's a much safer topic.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Definitely.""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""Anyone have any good movie recommendations for after?""
[Message 51] Kai: ""I just watched that new thriller on Netflix. It's pretty good.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Ooh, I'll check it out.""
[Message 53] Jamie: ""What's it called?""
[Message 54] Kai: "" 'Midnight Shadows' ""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Sounds intriguing.""
[Message 56] Jamie: ""Okay, adding it to my list.""
[Message 57] Kai: ""Cool. See you guys at 7.""
[Message 58] Jamie: ""Later!""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Bye.""
[Message 60] Kai: ""So, about Sarah… I heard she was having trouble with her landlord. Maybe he snapped?""
[Message 61] Jamie: ""Oh really? I didn't know that.""
[Message 62] Alex: ""That's a possibility, I guess.""
[Message 63] Kai: ""Yeah, apparently he was threatening to evict her and raise the rent.""
[Message 64] Jamie: ""Damn, that's messed up. Some people just take the low road.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""That could be a real motive for the landlord to want her gone.""
[Message 66] Kai: ""Exactly. And she always stood up for herself.""
[Message 67] Jamie: ""Yeah, she had this quiet strength about her.""
[Message 68] Alex: ""Maybe the cops should be looking at him.""
[Message 69] Kai: ""I hope they are. Anyone who intents to purposefully hurt someone needs to be caught.""
[Message 70] Jamie: ""Me too. This whole thing is just so sad.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Agreed. Two lives lost for nothing.""
[Message 72] Kai: ""True, true. Still, what if it’s just a wild coincidence the guy was buying Stabbing with a knife at the store? I'd hate it if he got punished for something he didn't do.""
[Message 73] Jamie: ""Wild coincidence, huh? Yeah, some stories have an intervening cause that makes harm even worse.""
[Message 74] Alex: ""Speaking of things escalating... Did anyone see how heated things got at the town hall meeting last week? All those protests could spark violence.""
[Message 75] Kai: ""Yeah, but that's a far cry from a targeted murder at a bar.""
[Message 76] Jamie: ""True. Still, tensions are high everywhere.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""I'm starting to think we should just stay home and watch movies instead of going out.""
[Message 78] Kai: ""I know, right? It's getting to that point.""
[Message 79] Jamie: ""I think she knew that she was at risk, given the whole situation.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Risk of what?""
[Message 81] Jamie: ""I don't know. Just a feeling I had.""
[Message 82] Kai: ""Guys, can we please just drop this for now? I'm getting a headache.""
[Message 83] Jamie: ""Okay, okay. Sorry.""
[Message 84] Alex: ""Yeah, let's change the subject.""
[Message 85] Kai: ""Thanks. So, any good sales going on this weekend?""
[Message 86] Jamie: ""I saw some at the mall. Maybe we can hit them up tomorrow.""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Sounds good. I need some new clothes.""
[Message 88] Kai: ""Me too. Retail therapy is always a good idea.""
[Message 89] Jamie: ""Exactly! Let's plan it out later.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""Sure thing.""
[Message 91] Kai: ""Perfect.""
[Message 92] Jamie: ""Hey, I just remembered something weird. I saw Alex leaving Early Hours around 1 AM last night.""
[Message 93] Alex: ""What? No, I wasn't!""
[Message 94] Kai: ""Whoa, Alex, what were you doing near Early Hours that late?""
[Message 95] Alex: ""I wasn't there! You're mistaken, Jamie.""
[Message 96] Jamie: ""I'm pretty sure it was you. Distinctive gait, and all.""
[Message 97] Kai: ""Alex, is there something you're not telling us?""
[Message 98] Alex: ""I swear, I was at home all night. I was watching 'Midnight Shadows', Kai you know that!""
[Message 99] Jamie: ""Maybe you intended to just grab a drink?""
[Message 100] Kai: ""Jamie, why are you singling him out like this?""
[Message 101] Jamie: ""I'm not! I just saw him, that's all. I assumed he knew them.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""I didn't. I swear! Why would I do anything like that?!""
[Message 103] Kai: ""Okay, everyone calm down. Alex, if you weren't there, you weren't there. Jamie, maybe you saw someone who looked like him.""
[Message 104] Jamie: ""Maybe. But it was dark, so I'm not sure.""
[Message 105] Alex: ""See? I'm innocent!""
[Message 106] Kai: ""Okay, okay. Let's just drop this. It's making me uncomfortable.""
[Message 107] Jamie: ""Fine. But I'm just saying...""
[Message 108] Alex: ""You're just saying what? That I'm a murderer? Seriously, Jamie?!""
[Message 109] Kai: ""Guys! Stop it! This is getting out of hand.""
[Message 110] Jamie: ""I didn't say that, Alex. I just found it suspicious, that's all. Since I knew the victims, I just feel like I should be aware of everyone around me.""
[Message 111] Alex: ""Suspicious how? Because I exist?""
[Message 112] Kai: ""This is exactly why I didn't want to talk about this anymore. Can we just go back to pizza and movies, please?""
[Message 113] Jamie: ""Okay, fine. Pizza and movies. But I'm not letting this go completely. It was a horrible thing. They're going away for a long time for this, for sure. Mark was so young.""
[Message 114] Alex: ""I agree, it was horrible. But I had nothing to do with it!""
[Message 115] Kai: ""Look, I believe you, Alex. Jamie, please give him the benefit of the doubt.""
[Message 116] Jamie: ""Fine. But if he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.""
[Message 117] Alex: ""What are you talking about?""
[Message 118] Kai: ""Jamie, just stop.""
[Message 119] Jamie: ""I'm just saying, everything's connected.""
[Message 120] Alex: ""I don't even know what you're implying. I'm going to go get ready for pizza. I need to get out of this house. I didn't even know Sarah got fired.""
[Message 121] Kai: ""Okay, Alex. See you soon. Jamie, let's try to have a good time tonight, okay?""
[Message 122] Jamie: ""I'll try. But something's not right, Kai. I can feel it.""
[Message 123] Kai: ""I know. But let's not let it ruin our night. Pizza and movies, remember?""
[Message 124] Jamie: ""Right. Pizza and movies. Hope it's enough.""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Leaving now. See you both at Mario's.""
[Message 126] Kai: ""Drive safe.""
[Message 127] Jamie: ""See ya.""
[Message 128] Kai: ""He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""
[Message 129] Jamie: ""Who was? And who are you talking to Kai?""
[Message 130] Kai: ""Oh! Just thinking out loud. Getting myself prepped to give my statement to the police. This whole thing is just messing with my head.""
[Message 131] Jamie: ""Oh ok, me too. I hope she didn't suffer.""
[Message 132] Kai: ""Me too.""
[Message 133] Jamie: ""Well I'm going to get ready. I'm hungry.""
[Message 134] Kai: ""Me too! See you both at Mario's.""

430,"[Message 1] Liam: Hey, you heard about what happened at the Bus Stop?
[Message 2] Chloe: Yeah, it's all over the news. So messed up.
[Message 3] Liam: I know, right? Poor Ashley and Mark...
[Message 4] Chloe: I can't believe it. Especially Ashley. She was so creative.
[Message 5] Liam: Any idea who did it?
[Message 6] Chloe: No clue. Cops are being tight-lipped. Heard they're looking at everyone.
[Message 7] Liam: Everyone? Seriously?
[Message 8] Chloe: Well, anyone who might have had a reason, I guess.
[Message 9] Liam: Like who?
[Message 10] Chloe: I don’t know. Did you know anyone who hated Mark, the Corrections Officer?
[Message 11] Liam: Not really. He seemed like a chill guy. Always saw him at the gym.
[Message 12] Chloe: True. Hey, you still doing trivia night this week?
[Message 13] Liam: Def. Need a distraction. You in?
[Message 14] Chloe: Yup! What time?
[Message 15] Liam: Usual, 8 PM at O'Malley's?
[Message 16] Chloe: Sounds good.
[Message 17] Liam: Cool. See you then.
[Message 18] Chloe: Later.
[Message 19] Liam: Oh, hey, did you ever meet someone called Alex?
[Message 20] Chloe: Alex? Vaguely. Why?
[Message 21] Liam: Just wondering. They're asking around.
[Message 22] Chloe: Weird. Maybe they knew Ashley?
[Message 23] Liam: Could be. Or Taylor. I heard he was acting weird lately.
[Message 24] Chloe: Taylor? How so?
[Message 25] Liam: I don't know. Just on edge. Like he was hiding something.
[Message 26] Chloe: Hmmm. I haven't seen him in ages.
[Message 27] Liam: Me neither. Okay, gotta run.
[Message 28] Chloe: Peace!
[Message 29] Daniel: Hey Chloe, it's Daniel. You heard?
[Message 30] Chloe: Daniel! Yeah, horrible. You okay?
[Message 31] Daniel: Shaken, honestly. I knew Mark pretty well.
[Message 32] Chloe: Me too. Did you ever see anything… off? With anyone around him?
[Message 33] Daniel: Not really. He was dealing with his own stuff, you know? Leaving Amy.
[Message 34] Chloe: Amy? Wow. I didn’t know they split.
[Message 35] Daniel: Yeah, it was messy. Lots of shouting.
[Message 36] Chloe: Messy is an understatement. Did you know she’s been saying stuff about how Mark ruined her life?
[Message 37] Daniel: Really? Like what?
[Message 38] Chloe: Stuff about him getting what he deserved. Creepy.
[Message 39] Daniel: Wow. That's...intense. Actus Reus: She always hated Corrections Officer.
[Message 40] Chloe: Tell me about it.
[Message 41] Daniel: Anyway, gotta head to work. Catch you later?
[Message 42] Chloe: Sure thing. Stay safe.
[Message 43] Taylor: Hey Liam, got a sec?
[Message 44] Liam: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 45] Taylor: Just wanted to ask... You heard anything about the Bus Stop thing?
[Message 46] Liam: Dude, everyone has. Why?
[Message 47] Taylor: Just... people are asking questions. About where I was that night.
[Message 48] Liam: Where *were* you?
[Message 49] Taylor: Home. Alone. Watching TV.
[Message 50] Liam: Okay... that's what you told the cops, right?
[Message 51] Taylor: Yeah, of course. But they seemed skeptical.
[Message 52] Liam: Why?
[Message 53] Taylor: I don't know! Maybe because I used to hang out with Ashley sometimes?
[Message 54] Liam: That's it?
[Message 55] Taylor: I guess? It's freaking me out.
[Message 56] Liam: Just stay calm. You have nothing to hide.
[Message 57] Taylor: Easier said than done.
[Message 58] Liam: Look, if you need anything, let me know.
[Message 59] Taylor: Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
[Message 60] Amy: Daniel, it’s Amy. Please call me.
[Message 61] Daniel: Hey Amy, what’s up?
[Message 62] Amy: The police were here. They asked about Mark.
[Message 63] Daniel: Yeah, they’re talking to everyone. Did you tell them where you were?
[Message 64] Amy: Yes! Home, alone. Like I told you. They were asking about whether I 'intended' to hurt him or something. Mens Rea: Potential for future threat.
[Message 65] Daniel: Don’t worry, they’re just doing their job.
[Message 66] Amy: I’m scared, Daniel.
[Message 67] Daniel: There’s nothing to be scared of. Just cooperate.
[Message 68] Amy: You think they suspect me?
[Message 69] Daniel: I don’t know. Did you tell them about the restraining order?
[Message 70] Amy: Yes! Of course! I didn’t have anything to do with this!
[Message 71] Daniel: I know, Amy. Just breathe.
[Message 72] Amy: What if they don't believe me? They are going away for a long time for this. Consider Punishment: Jail time.
[Message 73] Daniel: They will. Just tell the truth.
[Message 74] Amy: I am!
[Message 75] Daniel: I have to go, Amy. Call me later.
[Message 76] Chloe: Liam, call me ASAP!
[Message 77] Liam: What is it? I'm at trivia night.
[Message 78] Chloe: Daniel told me something crazy.
[Message 79] Liam: What? Spill.
[Message 80] Chloe: He said Amy and Mark were having serious issues.
[Message 81] Liam: I heard that too. But so what? Lots of people have relationship problems.
[Message 82] Chloe: But Daniel said Amy was saying all kinds of messed-up stuff after they split. Like she wanted him gone.
[Message 83] Liam: Okay, that's definitely not good. But still doesn't prove anything.
[Message 84] Chloe: True. But get this – Daniel saw her buying Car accident (vehicular homicide) fluid the day before. Actus Reus: Car accident (vehicular homicide) at the store.
[Message 85] Liam: Seriously? Car accident (vehicular homicide)? That's...convenient.
[Message 86] Chloe: I know, right?
[Message 87] Liam: Okay, maybe we should tell the cops.
[Message 88] Chloe: Already did. Waiting to hear back.
[Message 89] Liam: Good call.
[Message 90] Chloe: You think she did it?
[Message 91] Liam: I don't know, Chloe. I really don't.
[Message 92] Taylor: Liam, it's me again.
[Message 93] Liam: What is it, Taylor? You sound stressed.
[Message 94] Taylor: I saw Alex last night.
[Message 95] Liam: Alex? Where?
[Message 96] Taylor: Near the bus stop. Around Midnight.
[Message 97] Liam: Midnight? The time of the murder?
[Message 98] Taylor: Yeah. He looked… agitated. Mens Rea: Agitated.
[Message 99] Liam: Did you talk to him?
[Message 100] Taylor: No! I just saw him from across the street. I didn't want to get involved.
[Message 101] Liam: You should tell the police this, Taylor.
[Message 102] Taylor: I don't want to get dragged into this even more!
[Message 103] Liam: But this could be important!
[Message 104] Taylor: I'll think about it. Just... keep it between us for now, okay?
[Message 105] Liam: Fine. But if you're hiding something, Taylor...
[Message 106] Taylor: I'm not hiding anything!
[Message 107] Liam: Okay, okay. Just... be careful.
[Message 108] Taylor: You too.
[Message 109] Daniel: Hey Chloe, did the cops call you back?
[Message 110] Chloe: Not yet. Still waiting.
[Message 111] Daniel: This is so messed up. I can't focus on anything.
[Message 112] Chloe: Me neither. I keep replaying everything in my head.
[Message 113] Daniel: I just feel so bad for Ashley. She was such a good person.
[Message 114] Chloe: I know. And she was working so hard on her activism, too.
[Message 115] Daniel: Yeah. It's all so senseless.
[Message 116] Chloe: You said you were close to Mark? Did he ever mention anyone he felt threatened by?
[Message 117] Daniel: No. He mostly talked about Amy. How crazy she was being.
[Message 118] Chloe: He definitely never said anything about Taylor?
[Message 119] Daniel: No, why?
[Message 120] Chloe: Just curious. Taylor seems nervous lately.
[Message 121] Daniel: Maybe he knows something he's not telling us.
[Message 122] Chloe: Could be. Or maybe he's just scared.
[Message 123] Daniel: Either way, it's suspicious.
[Message 124] Chloe: Agreed.
[Message 125] Liam: Chloe, the cops just called me.
[Message 126] Chloe: What did they say?
[Message 127] Liam: They want to talk to me. About Taylor.
[Message 128] Chloe: About Taylor? What did you tell them?
[Message 129] Liam: I told them he said he saw Alex near the bus stop.
[Message 130] Chloe: Good. Did you tell them he seemed nervous?
[Message 131] Liam: Yeah. Everything.
[Message 132] Chloe: Okay. This might be getting somewhere.
[Message 133] Liam: I hope so. This waiting is killing me.
[Message 134] Chloe: Me too. Keep me updated.
[Message 135] Liam: Will do.
[Message 136] Taylor: Liam, I messed up.
[Message 137] Liam: What happened?
[Message 138] Taylor: I saw Alex again. He was talking about hurting Ashley right before he went over there. Concurrence: Actions and intent.
[Message 139] Liam: Are you kidding me? Why didn't you say anything before?!
[Message 140] Taylor: I was scared! I didn't want to get involved!
[Message 141] Liam: You need to tell the police this, Taylor! Now!
[Message 142] Taylor: Okay, okay. I will. But... promise me you won't tell them I saw him earlier.
[Message 143] Liam: Why not?
[Message 144] Taylor: Just... please? For me?
[Message 145] Liam: I can't promise that, Taylor! This is serious!
[Message 146] Taylor: Please, Liam! I'm begging you!
[Message 147] Liam: Fine. But you have to go to the police *right now*.
[Message 148] Taylor: I will. Thank you, Liam. Thank you.
[Message 149] Daniel: Chloe, I’m starting to think it’s not Amy.
[Message 150] Chloe: Why? What happened?
[Message 151] Daniel: Something’s just not adding up. I heard her shouting probably provoked him. Causation: Victim's own aggression leading to the crime.
[Message 152] Chloe: You think she was set up?
[Message 153] Daniel: I don’t know. But I feel like we’re missing something.
[Message 154] Chloe: Maybe. But the Car accident (vehicular homicide) thing is pretty damning.
[Message 155] Daniel: True. But something feels off.
[Message 156] Chloe: Okay, I’ll keep an open mind.
[Message 157] Daniel: Thanks. I appreciate it.
[Message 158] Chloe: No problem. Let’s just hope they catch whoever did this soon.
[Message 159] Daniel: Amen to that.
[Message 160] Liam: Chloe, the police arrested Alex.
[Message 161] Chloe: Seriously? On what grounds?
[Message 162] Liam: Taylor told them everything. About seeing him near the bus stop, about him talking about hurting Ashley.
[Message 163] Chloe: Wow. So it was Alex all along?
[Message 164] Liam: Looks like it. I can’t believe it.
[Message 165] Chloe: Me neither. I guess Taylor was just scared.
[Message 166] Liam: Yeah. He should have come forward sooner.
[Message 167] Chloe: Well, at least it's over.
[Message 168] Liam: Yeah. Justice for Ashley and Mark.
[Message 169] Chloe: Exactly.

[Message 2] Maya: Hey David! How did it go? Any luck?
[Message 3] Alex: Evening, folks. Job fair sounds…intense.
[Message 4] David: It was something, Alex. Lots of people, lots of handshakes. Maya, I think I made some good connections. We'll see.
[Message 5] Maya: Fingers crossed for you, David! So, anyone catch the news about the new park they're planning downtown?
[Message 6] Alex: Heard something about it. Supposed to be replacing that old parking lot near the river?
[Message 7] Maya: Yep, that's the one! I think it'll be great for the community.
[Message 8] David: A park would be fantastic. It's been needed for ages.
[Message 9] Alex: Agreed. More green space is always a plus. I wonder what kind of amenities they're planning.
[Message 10] Maya: The article I read mentioned a playground, a dog park, and a walking path.
[Message 11] David: Dog park! My golden retriever, Gus, would love that.
[Message 12] Alex: Sounds promising. Hopefully, they prioritize good landscaping.
[Message 13] Maya: Me too! I'd love to see some native plants used.
[Message 14] David: That would be environmentally conscious, for sure. Speaking of environment, has anyone else noticed how beautiful the leaves are changing?
[Message 15] Alex: Absolutely stunning this year. The reds are particularly vibrant.
[Message 16] Maya: I know! I took a walk in the park yesterday and it was just breathtaking.
[Message 17] David: I'm planning a hike up near Lake Superior this weekend to see them.
[Message 18] Maya: Oh, that sounds amazing, David! I'm jealous.
[Message 19] Alex: Enjoy the hike! Maybe send us some pictures.
[Message 20] David: Will do! Anyone have family dinner plans coming up?
[Message 21] Maya: Actually, yes! We're having a big family dinner next Sunday. My grandma's making her famous pot roast.
[Message 22] Alex: Pot roast sounds delicious. My family tends to scatter, so big dinners are rare.
[Message 23] David: We're doing Thanksgiving at my sister's this year. Can't wait to see the grandkids.
[Message 24] Maya: That's going to be fun, David. Grandkids are the best.
[Message 25] Alex: What's everyone's favorite Thanksgiving dish?
[Message 26] David: Mashed potatoes, hands down.
[Message 27] Maya: Pumpkin pie! With lots of whipped cream.
[Message 28] Alex: I'm a stuffing person myself. Gotta have that sage and onion flavor.
[Message 29] David: Good stuffing is essential. No argument there.
[Message 30] Maya: Agreed! So, back to the park for a sec... anyone know when they're planning to break ground?
[Message 31] Alex: I think the article mentioned next spring, if all goes according to plan.
[Message 32] David: Spring would be perfect timing.
[Message 33] Maya: I'm already picturing myself sitting on a bench, reading a book in the sunshine.
[Message 34] Alex: Sounds idyllic. I'd probably be more inclined to try some urban gardening.
[Message 35] David: That's a great idea, Alex. Maybe they'll have community garden plots.
[Message 36] Maya: Oh, I hope so! That would be amazing.
[Message 37] Alex: I'd love to grow some herbs and vegetables right in the city center.
[Message 38] David: Fresh herbs always make a meal better.
[Message 39] Maya: Absolutely! Okay, side note, has anyone tried that new coffee shop on Hennepin? ""The Daily Grind""?
[Message 40] Alex: Not yet, but I've heard good things.
[Message 41] David: I haven't either. Is it any good?
[Message 42] Maya: I went yesterday and got a latte. It was pretty delicious. The atmosphere is really cozy too.
[Message 43] Alex: I might have to check it out this weekend.
[Message 44] David: I'll add it to my list. Thanks for the recommendation, Maya.
[Message 45] Maya: No problem! Always happy to share a good coffee spot.
[Message 46] Alex: So, David, how did the companies at the job fair seem? Any you were particularly impressed with?
[Message 47] David: There were a few that stood out. One healthcare provider seemed very progressive with their employee benefits.
[Message 48] Maya: That's good to hear! Benefits are so important.
[Message 49] Alex: Definitely. Shows they value their employees.
[Message 50] David: Exactly. And another one was focused on community outreach, which I really appreciated.
[Message 51] Maya: That's great, David! Aligning with your values is key.
[Message 52] Alex: Agreed. It makes the work feel more meaningful.
[Message 53] David: You're both right. It's about more than just a paycheck.
[Message 54] Maya: Speaking of meaningful work, I had a really fulfilling day at the pharmacy today. Helping people is always rewarding.
[Message 55] Alex: That's wonderful, Maya. Making a difference in people's lives is what it's all about.
[Message 56] David: I feel the same way about nursing. It's challenging, but incredibly rewarding.
[Message 57] Maya: I can imagine, David. You must see some tough things.
[Message 58] David: I do, but also a lot of resilience and hope.
[Message 59] Alex: That's inspiring.
[Message 60] Maya: It really is. Okay, switching gears again...anyone watching any good shows lately?
[Message 61] Alex: I'm finally catching up on ""Midnight Bloom,"" the gardening show everyone was raving about.
[Message 62] David: Never heard of it. Is it any good?
[Message 63] Maya: I've seen a few episodes. It's actually really relaxing and informative.
[Message 64] Alex: Yeah, the host is super knowledgeable, and the visuals are stunning.
[Message 65] David: I might have to check it out. I'm always looking for new things to watch.
[Message 66] Maya: I'm currently obsessed with ""Culinary Quest."" It's a food travel show.
[Message 67] Alex: Oh, that sounds right up my alley.
[Message 68] David: I prefer documentaries myself. Something informative and thought-provoking.
[Message 69] Maya: To each their own! I need something light and entertaining after a long day.
[Message 70] Alex: I get that. Sometimes you just need to unwind.
[Message 71] David: Absolutely.
[Message 72] Maya: Speaking of unwinding, what are you guys doing this weekend besides the hike, David?
[Message 73] David: Not much planned yet. Maybe some yard work.
[Message 74] Alex: I'm hoping to finally finish planting my bulbs for next spring.
[Message 75] Maya: Oh, that's a good idea! I should probably do that too.
[Message 76] David: What kind of bulbs are you planting, Alex?
[Message 77] Alex: Mostly tulips and daffodils. Some hyacinths as well.
[Message 78] Maya: I love daffodils! They're so cheerful in the spring.
[Message 79] David: They are. A welcome sight after a long winter.
[Message 80] Alex: Agreed. It's something to look forward to.
[Message 81] Maya: Definitely. Okay, I'm getting a little tired. I think I'm going to head to bed soon.
[Message 82] David: Good idea. I should probably do the same.
[Message 83] Alex: Night, you two.
[Message 84] Maya: Good night, Alex! Good luck with the job search, David!
[Message 85] David: Thanks, Maya! Sleep well.
[Message 86] Alex: Hey, on a completely unrelated note, anyone else having issues with their internet provider lately?
[Message 87] David: Now that you mention it, yes. It's been cutting out randomly.
[Message 88] Maya: I thought it was just me! Mine's been terrible for the past week.
[Message 89] Alex: Ugh, it's so frustrating. Especially when you're trying to stream something.
[Message 90] David: I might have to call them and complain.
[Message 91] Maya: Let me know if you have any luck! I've been putting it off.
[Message 92] Alex: Me too. I hate dealing with customer service.
[Message 93] David: I understand. It's never a pleasant experience.
[Message 94] Maya: Okay, I'm officially signing off now. Have a good night, everyone!
[Message 95] Alex: Sweet dreams, Maya!
[Message 96] David: Good night, Maya. Talk to you later.
[Message 97] Alex: David, did you ever get around to fixing that leaky faucet you were talking about last month?
[Message 98] David: You know, I completely forgot about it. Thanks for reminding me, Alex!
[Message 99] Alex: No problem. Just didn't want it to cause any water damage.
[Message 100] David: I appreciate that. I'll try to tackle it this weekend.
[Message 101] Alex: Good luck! Plumbing can be a pain.
[Message 102] David: Tell me about it. I'm not exactly a handyman.
[Message 103] Alex: YouTube tutorials are your friend.
[Message 104] David: True. I'll check them out. Thanks again, Alex.
[Message 105] Alex: Anytime. Well, I think I'm going to call it a night as well.
[Message 106] David: Sounds good. Get some rest.
[Message 107] Alex: You too. Have a great hike this weekend!
[Message 108] David: Thanks, Alex! I will. Hopefully the weather cooperates.
[Message 109] Alex: Fingers crossed! Good night.
[Message 110] David: Good night, Alex.
[Message 111] David: (Thinking out loud) Now, where did I put that wrench...?
[Message 112] David: (To himself) Oh, right, the garage.
[Message 113] David: (Remembering) And I need to pick up some Teflon tape.
[Message 114] David: (Shaking his head) This weekend is going to be busy.
[Message 115] David: (Texting back to the group - oops, wrong chat!) Sorry, folks, thinking out loud. To-do list for the weekend is overflowing!
[Message 116] David: (Correcting) That was meant for my personal notes! My apologies.
[Message 117] Maya: (Laughing) No worries, David! Happens to the best of us!
[Message 118] Alex: (Chuckles) We've all been there.
[Message 119] David: Embarrassing! Thanks for understanding. Back to the park - hope the design takes into account noise from the street.
[Message 120] Maya: Good point, David! That could definitely be an issue.
[Message 121] Alex: Maybe some strategically placed trees could help buffer the noise.
[Message 122] David: That's a good idea, Alex.
[Message 123] Maya: Hopefully the city planners are thinking of everything.
[Message 124] David: Let's hope so. Well, I really should get going. Long day tomorrow.
[Message 125] Alex: Understood. Good night, David!",0,
432,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone! Anyone got any fun weekend plans? I'm thinking of finally tackling the living room decor.
[Message 2] Ben: Decorating? Sounds ambitious, Alex! I'm just hoping to catch up on some reading. What are you thinking of doing?
[Message 3] Carol: Ooh, I love home decor! What's your style, Alex? I'm more of a minimalist myself.
[Message 4] David: Minimalist, huh? I'm all about cozy maximalism. Lots of textures and colors.
[Message 5] Alex: I'm kind of all over the place. I like the clean lines of modern, but with some pops of bohemian color. Maybe a big rug and some throw pillows?
[Message 6] Ben: A rug definitely ties a room together. I always struggle picking the right size.
[Message 7] Carol: Measure, measure, measure! That's my motto. Too small is worse than too big, in my opinion.
[Message 8] David: Agree! And don't be afraid of bold patterns. Life's too short for beige everything.
[Message 9] Alex: I'm thinking a rug with some blues and greens. And maybe painting an accent wall a deep teal?
[Message 10] Ben: Teal sounds nice. Though I'm personally partial to earthy tones.
[Message 11] Carol: Teal can be very calming. I have a teal throw blanket in my bedroom. It's my happy place.
[Message 12] David: I saw this amazing velvet couch in a teal color the other day. I'm seriously tempted to buy it, even though I don't need it.
[Message 13] Alex: Velvet sounds so luxurious! But I have a cat, so I'm worried about the claws.
[Message 14] Ben: Yeah, velvet and cats aren't a great mix. Have you considered microfiber? It's pretty durable.
[Message 15] Carol: Microfiber is a good option. Also, maybe invest in a scratching post?
[Message 16] David: Or just embrace the cat-scratched look! Call it ""distressed.""
[Message 17] Alex: Haha, I like your attitude, David! I might just have to get creative with hiding the scratches.
[Message 18] Ben: On a completely different note, anyone been watching that new baking show?
[Message 19] Carol: Oh yes! ""Sweet Surrender""! I'm obsessed. The chocolate lava cake episode was insane.
[Message 20] David: I missed that one! I'll have to catch it online. I'm more of a bread baker myself.
[Message 21] Alex: Back to decor, what about wall art? I'm struggling to find something I love.
[Message 22] Ben: Etsy is a great place to find unique pieces. You can support independent artists too.
[Message 23] Carol: Agreed! Or try thrift stores. You can find some real gems if you're patient.
[Message 24] David: I like to create my own art. It's a fun way to personalize your space.
[Message 25] Alex: That's a great idea, David! I'm not very artistic, but maybe I could try something simple.
[Message 26] Ben: There are tons of DIY tutorials online. You could paint an abstract piece or even just frame some pressed flowers.
[Message 27] Carol: Oh, pressed flowers are beautiful! I saw a tutorial for making them with a microwave.
[Message 28] David: I just remembered, I need to go to the hardware store later. Anyone need anything?
[Message 29] Alex: I could use some paint samples if you're going! Teal, maybe a lighter blue...
[Message 30] Ben: I'm good, thanks! Good luck with the painting, Alex!
[Message 31] Carol: Me too, but thanks for offering!
[Message 32] David: No problem! I'll grab some samples for you, Alex. What kind of finish are you thinking?
[Message 33] Alex: Matte, I think. Something not too shiny.
[Message 34] Ben: Matte is good for hiding imperfections.
[Message 35] Carol: I agree. Plus, it gives a more modern look.
[Message 36] David: Alright, matte it is! I'll see what they have.
[Message 37] Alex: Thanks so much, David! You're a lifesaver.
[Message 38] Ben: Seriously, you're the best.
[Message 39] Carol: Yes, thank you David!
[Message 40] David: Happy to help!
[Message 41] Alex: So, anyone else doing any decorating projects?
[Message 42] Ben: Not right now, but I'm thinking of re-organizing my bookshelf soon.
[Message 43] Carol: I want to get some new plants for my balcony.
[Message 44] David: I'm always rearranging things. It's like a constant cycle of moving furniture.
[Message 45] Alex: Plants are a great idea, Carol! They really bring life to a space.
[Message 46] Ben: Just be careful not to overwater them! I've killed so many plants that way.
[Message 47] Carol: Haha, I'm a bit of a plant whisperer. I have a whole system.
[Message 48] David: I'm more of a low-maintenance plant person. Cacti and succulents are my friends.
[Message 49] Alex: Speaking of maintenance, I really need to clean my windows.
[Message 50] Ben: Window cleaning is the worst chore. I always put it off.
[Message 51] Carol: I actually find it kind of therapeutic.
[Message 52] David: Really? I'd rather scrub toilets.
[Message 53] Alex: Okay, okay, let's not get too graphic!
[Message 54] Ben: Agreed! Back to decorating...are you planning on getting new curtains, Alex?
[Message 55] Alex: I hadn't really thought about it. What do you think?
[Message 56] Carol: Curtains can really change the look of a room.
[Message 57] David: I'm a big fan of sheer curtains. They let in lots of light.
[Message 58] Alex: Sheer curtains might be nice. My living room gets a lot of sun.
[Message 59] Ben: You could also do blinds or shades if you want more privacy.
[Message 60] Carol: Or a combination of both!
[Message 61] David: Ooh, good point!
[Message 62] Alex: So many choices! I'm getting overwhelmed.
[Message 63] Ben: Just take it one step at a time.
[Message 64] Carol: Exactly! Don't try to do everything at once.
[Message 65] David: And have fun with it! It's your space, so make it your own.
[Message 66] Alex: Thanks, guys! I appreciate the advice.
[Message 67] Ben: No problem! We're always here to help.
[Message 68] Carol: Absolutely!
[Message 69] David: Anytime!
[Message 70] Alex: Thinking about it, I'd love to get a new coffee table too.
[Message 71] Ben: What style are you leaning towards?
[Message 72] Carol: Round or square?
[Message 73] David: Glass or wood?
[Message 74] Alex: Hmm...maybe a round wooden one?
[Message 75] Ben: Round is good for smaller spaces.
[Message 76] Carol: And less likely to be bumped into!
[Message 77] David: Unless you're me, then everything is fair game.
[Message 78] Alex: Haha! I'm pretty clumsy myself.
[Message 79] Ben: Maybe get one with rounded edges, just in case.
[Message 80] Carol: Good thinking!
[Message 81] David: Safety first!
[Message 82] Alex: Alright, round wooden coffee table with rounded edges it is!
[Message 83] Ben: Sounds perfect!
[Message 84] Carol: Yay!
[Message 85] David: You got this, Alex!
[Message 86] Alex: Okay, back to paint colors… I'm also going to be taking a trip to Palm Spring next month.
[Message 87] Ben: Palm Springs? Sounds fun! Going solo, or with someone?
[Message 88] Carol: I love Palm Springs! Have you been before?
[Message 89] David: Palm Springs is awesome. Lots of great mid-century modern architecture.
[Message 90] Alex: Going with a friend. Neither of us has been, so it'll be an adventure.
[Message 91] Ben: That sounds like a blast! Enjoy!
[Message 92] Carol: Definitely check out the Moorten Botanical Garden!
[Message 93] David: And the Parker Hotel! Even if you don't stay there, it's worth a visit.
[Message 94] Alex: Thanks for the tips! I'll add them to our list.
[Message 95] Ben: Have you booked a hotel yet?
[Message 96] Carol: Check out the Ace Hotel too! It has a cool vibe.
[Message 97] David: Don't forget to pack sunscreen! The desert sun is intense.
[Message 98] Alex: We booked an Airbnb. It looks super cute.
[Message 99] Ben: Airbnb is a great option! More space and a kitchen.
[Message 100] Carol: Plus, you can often find better deals than hotels.
[Message 101] David: Just read the reviews carefully before you book!
[Message 102] Alex: Definitely! I'm a review addict.
[Message 103] Ben: Me too! I always read at least a dozen before making a decision.
[Message 104] Carol: Same here!
[Message 105] David: Smart!
[Message 106] Alex: Okay, I'm going to start gathering some inspiration photos for the living room.
[Message 107] Ben: Pinterest is your friend!
[Message 108] Carol: Houzz is also a good resource.
[Message 109] David: Don't forget Instagram!
[Message 110] Alex: Thanks, guys! I'll check them all out.
[Message 111] Ben: Have fun!
[Message 112] Carol: Happy decorating!
[Message 113] David: Enjoy the process!
[Message 114] Alex: I'm thinking of getting a new lamp too. Any recommendations?
[Message 115] Ben: Floor lamp or table lamp?
[Message 116] Carol: What kind of lighting do you want? Ambient or task lighting?
[Message 117] David: Consider the style of the rest of your furniture.
[Message 118] Alex: Table lamp, I think. Something for next to the couch. Ambient lighting.
[Message 119] Ben: A ceramic lamp with a linen shade would be nice.
[Message 120] Carol: Or a brass lamp with a patterned shade.
[Message 121] David: A vintage lamp could add some character.
[Message 122] Alex: I like the idea of a vintage lamp!
[Message 123] Ben: Check out antique stores and flea markets.
[Message 124] Carol: You might find a hidden gem!
[Message 125] David: Just make sure it's in good working condition.
[Message 126] Alex: Good point! I'll definitely test it out before I buy it.
[Message 127] Ben: Smart!
[Message 128] Carol: Wise!
[Message 129] David: Always a good idea!
[Message 130] Alex: Okay, I think I have a good plan of attack. Thanks for all your help, everyone!
[Message 131] Ben: No problem!
[Message 132] Carol: Anytime!
[Message 133] David: You got this!
[Message 134] Alex: I'm off to browse some paint samples!
[Message 135] Ben: Good luck!
[Message 136] Carol: Have fun!
[Message 137] David: Tell us how it goes!
[Message 138] Alex: Will do! Talk to you all later!
[Message 139] Ben: Bye!
[Message 140] Carol: Goodbye",0,
433,"[Message 1] Riley: ""OMG, did you guys hear about what happened at Spa?""
[Message 2] Jordan: ""Yeah, it's all over the news. So messed up.""
[Message 3] Kai: ""What happened? I've been off the grid.""
[Message 4] Riley: ""That journalist, Dana, was killed. Some kind of accident, they think.""
[Message 5] Jordan: ""Accident? Someone dropped something on her from the roof. Seems pretty intentional to me.""
[Message 6] Kai: ""Whoa, seriously? That's insane! I knew Dana, she was always so nice.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Midday, huh? I was getting coffee then.""
[Message 8] Riley: ""Yeah, right around noon. Crazy.""
[Message 9] Jordan: ""I heard they're questioning everyone who was there that day.""
[Message 10] Kai: ""Well, I wasn't. I was at that protest downtown.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Protest? About what?""
[Message 12] Kai: ""The new zoning laws. Total scam.""
[Message 13] Riley: ""Focus, guys. Someone killed Dana. This is serious.""
[Message 14] Jordan: ""I know, I know. Just trying to lighten the mood. This whole thing is so heavy.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Did anyone see anything?""
[Message 16] Riley: ""Not that I've heard. Everyone's claiming they were somewhere else.""
[Message 17] Jordan: ""Classic. I bet the cops are swamped.""
[Message 18] Kai: ""They should be looking at the cult people. Dana was writing about them, right?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Cult people? Seriously, Kai?""
[Message 20] Kai: ""I'm just saying, it's a possibility. They didn't like her exposing their rituals.""
[Message 21] Riley: ""Okay, let's not jump to conclusions. We don't know anything for sure.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""True. But what if it *was* someone who wanted to shut her up?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Jordan, you're making it sound like a conspiracy.""
[Message 24] Jordan: ""Maybe it is! Dana was digging into some shady stuff with that inheritance case.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""See? It could be anything!""
[Message 26] Riley: ""Let's just let the police do their job, okay?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Good idea. I'm going to head out. Need to clear my head.""
[Message 28] Riley: ""Alright, stay safe.""
[Message 29] Jordan: ""Later, Alex.""
[Message 30] Kai: ""Peace.""
[Message 31] Jordan: ""You think Alex knows something?""
[Message 32] Riley: ""What? Why would you say that?""
[Message 33] Jordan: ""Just the way they were acting. Nervous.""
[Message 34] Riley: ""You're reading too much into it. Alex is always a bit…intense.""
[Message 35] Jordan: ""Maybe. But I still think it's weird.""
[Message 36] Kai: ""Hey, you guys seen that new cafe downtown? Heard their lattes are amazing.""
[Message 37] Riley: ""Kai, seriously? Now is not the time for coffee talk.""
[Message 38] Kai: ""Sorry, sorry. Just trying to distract myself.""
[Message 39] Jordan: ""Distract yourself from what?""
[Message 40] Kai: ""From the fact that someone murdered Dana! It's creeping me out.""
[Message 41] Riley: ""Me too. I can't believe this happened.""
[Message 42] Jordan: ""I keep thinking about her family. This must be devastating.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Guys, I need to ask... Did Dana ever mention anything about feeling threatened? Any enemies?""
[Message 44] Riley: ""Now that you mention it, she did say she was getting some weird messages online.""
[Message 45] Jordan: ""Weird messages? Like what?""
[Message 46] Riley: ""I don't know, she didn't go into details. Just said it was making her uneasy.""
[Message 47] Kai: ""See? That's suspicious! Maybe those messages had something to do with it.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""Could be. This whole thing feels wrong.""
[Message 49] Riley: ""It *is* wrong! Someone intentionally killed Dana.""
[Message 50] Jordan: ""I wonder if the police are tracking those messages.""
[Message 51] Kai: ""They better be. They should also look into who benefits from her death.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Benefits? You mean financially?""
[Message 53] Kai: ""Yeah. Who gets her inheritance? Who gains from her stories not being published?""
[Message 54] Riley: ""Okay, that's getting a bit morbid, don't you think?""
[Message 55] Jordan: ""True. But Kai has a point. Motive is everything.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""I'm going to try to find out if Dana told anyone else about the messages. Maybe she confided in someone else.""
[Message 57] Riley: ""Good idea. The more information we have, the better.""
[Message 58] Jordan: ""Let me know if you find anything.""
[Message 59] Kai: ""Me too.""
[Message 60] Alex: ""Will do. Talk soon.""
[Message 61] Riley: ""Later.""
[Message 62] Jordan: ""Bye.""
[Message 63] Kai: ""Catch you guys later.""
[Message 64] Jordan: ""Riley, you still there?""
[Message 65] Riley: ""Yeah, what's up?""
[Message 66] Jordan: ""I just had a weird thought. Remember how Alex always complained about Dana's articles?""
[Message 67] Riley: ""Complained? I thought they were friends.""
[Message 68] Jordan: ""They were, but Alex thought Dana was too harsh on the political stuff.""
[Message 69] Riley: ""I don't know, Jordan. Seems like a stretch.""
[Message 70] Jordan: ""Maybe. But it's worth considering, right?""
[Message 71] Riley: ""I guess so. I'm just trying to wrap my head around all of this.""
[Message 72] Jordan: ""Me too. It's all so messed up.""
[Message 73] Kai: ""Has anyone seen my keys? I swear I just had them.""
[Message 74] Riley: ""Seriously, Kai? Now?""
[Message 75] Kai: ""What? I need to find them! I have to go to the store.""
[Message 76] Jordan: ""Maybe they're under the couch?""
[Message 77] Kai: ""I already checked there! Ugh, this is so frustrating.""
[Message 78] Riley: ""Just breathe, Kai. They'll turn up.""
[Message 79] Jordan: ""Maybe Alex took them as a prank.""
[Message 80] Kai: ""Alex wouldn't do that! Would they?""
[Message 81] Riley: ""I doubt it. Alex has been pretty shaken up about all this.""
[Message 82] Jordan: ""True. Maybe I'm just paranoid.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Guys, I found something! Someone saw a figure on the roof of Spa right before it happened. They couldn't make out who it was, but they were definitely there.""
[Message 84] Riley: ""A figure on the roof? That's huge!""
[Message 85] Jordan: ""Did they say anything else? Any details at all?""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Just that they saw someone up there. They assumed it was maintenance or something.""
[Message 87] Kai: ""Maintenance at midday? That's weird.""
[Message 88] Riley: ""Definitely suspicious. The cops need to know about this.""
[Message 89] Jordan: ""Absolutely. Alex, you should tell them.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""I will. I'm going to call them now.""
[Message 91] Riley: ""Good. Let us know what they say.""
[Message 92] Jordan: ""Yeah, keep us updated.""
[Message 93] Kai: ""This is getting intense. I hope they catch whoever did this.""
[Message 94] Riley: ""Me too. Dana didn't deserve this.""
[Message 95] Jordan: ""I still can't believe it. It feels like a nightmare.""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Okay, I just got off the phone with the police. They're sending someone to talk to the witness.""
[Message 97] Riley: ""Great. Hopefully, that will lead them somewhere.""
[Message 98] Jordan: ""Fingers crossed.""
[Message 99] Kai: ""Hey, Riley, do you remember that time Dana told us about how she was trying to expose that corrupt city official, Billings?""
[Message 100] Riley: ""Vaguely. What about it?""
[Message 101] Kai: ""Maybe Billings had something to do with this. He was aware she was onto him, and he intended to stop her.""
[Message 102] Jordan: ""Yeah, like if she hadn't been snooping around, none of this would have happened to her.""
[Message 103] Alex: ""That's a good point, Kai. That guy had a serious motive.""
[Message 104] Riley: ""It's all conjecture. We're just guessing.""
[Message 105] Alex: ""True, but it's another lead for the police to follow.""
[Message 106] Jordan: ""Alex, if Dana was getting weird messages and you were worried about her stories, did you ever think to warn her? Maybe talk her out of whatever she was doing?""
[Message 107] Alex: ""That's not fair, Jordan. I never wanted anything bad to happen to her! I just wanted her to be careful.""
[Message 108] Kai: ""Whoa, things are getting heated.""
[Message 109] Riley: ""Easy, guys. Let's not start accusing each other.""
[Message 110] Jordan: ""I'm not accusing anyone. I'm just asking a question.""
[Message 111] Alex: ""I told you, I never wanted this! I even tried to call 911, but my phone died.""
[Message 112] Kai: ""Okay, okay. Let's all take a deep breath.""
[Message 113] Riley: ""Yeah, deep breaths. We're all stressed out. This is a tragedy for all of us, and they're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 114] Jordan: ""True. We need to stick together and support each other.""
[Message 115] Alex: ""I agree. We can't let this tear us apart.""
[Message 116] Kai: ""Yeah, let's focus on helping the police find the real killer.""
[Message 117] Riley: ""Exactly. That's the most important thing.""
[Message 118] Jordan: ""So, Alex, did the police seem interested in the roof witness?""

[Message 3] ANNA: It's awful! I was just there yesterday afternoon.
[Message 4] BEN: Who were the victims?
[Message 5] CHLOE: I heard one was a Corrections Officer, Mike. The other was a teenager, Sarah.
[Message 6] LIAM: Sarah? Oh man, I knew her from the activist group.
[Message 7] ANNA: This whole thing is so messed up. I hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 8] BEN: The cops will find them. Beaumont PD is usually on top of things.
[Message 9] CHLOE: You think it was a robbery gone wrong?
[Message 10] LIAM: Maybe. Or something personal. Sarah was pretty outspoken.
[Message 11] ANNA: Liam, don't go spreading rumors. It's insensitive.
[Message 12] LIAM: Just saying, she made enemies. Remember that protest at the mall last month?
[Message 13] BEN: I missed that. What was it about?
[Message 14] LIAM: Some environmental thing. She was leading the charge.
[Message 15] CHLOE: Anyway, I'm scared to go back to the mall now.
[Message 16] ANNA: Me too. I need to pick up some stuff, but I'm putting it off.
[Message 17] BEN: Guys, don't let it scare you. It's probably a one-time thing.
[Message 18] CHLOE: Easy for you to say, Ben. You live on the other side of town.
[Message 19] ANNA: Did they say how they died?
[Message 20] LIAM: I heard something about Poisoning via inhalation.
[Message 21] CHLOE: Seriously? That's horrible!
[Message 22] BEN: Wow, that's... unusual. Not exactly your run-of-the-mill crime.
[Message 23] ANNA: Maybe Mike, the Corrections Officer, had something to do with it? Maybe he was targeted?
[Message 24] CHLOE: What do you mean, Anna?
[Message 25] ANNA: I don't know, prisons, gangs, maybe he knew too much or something.
[Message 26] BEN: Reaching a bit, aren't we?
[Message 27] LIAM: Yeah, Anna. That's a stretch. Although, Mike was always ambitious, I heard.
[Message 28] CHLOE: You guys are all speculating. Let's just wait for the police report.
[Message 29] BEN: Good idea, Chloe. By the way, anyone up for pizza tonight? Distract ourselves.
[Message 30] ANNA: I'm in. I need a distraction.
[Message 31] LIAM: Count me in too.
[Message 32] CHLOE: Okay, pizza sounds good.
[Message 33] ANNA: I saw Jess at the mall yesterday. She looked really stressed.
[Message 34] BEN: Jess? The one who works at the perfume store?
[Message 35] ANNA: Yeah, that's the one. She was buying Poisoning via inhalation there, that's what she told me.
[Message 36] LIAM: Wait, seriously? She bought Poisoning via inhalation? When?
[Message 37] ANNA: Around 6 pm I think. She said it was for some project at work or something.
[Message 38] CHLOE: That's weird. I hope the cops talk to her.
[Message 39] BEN: Definitely weird.
[Message 40] LIAM: Maybe she was going to quit anyway.
[Message 41] CHLOE: Ben, don’t tell me you're defending her?
[Message 42] BEN: Defending her? No, just saying that doesn't make her a murderer, guys.
[Message 43] ANNA: What’s done is done.
[Message 44] LIAM: Anyway, I can't believe this happened. Sarah was so young.
[Message 45] CHLOE: I know, it's heartbreaking.
[Message 46] BEN: Okay, pizza at 7?
[Message 47] ANNA: Sounds good. See you then.
[Message 48] LIAM: Later.

[Message 3] Casey: I know, right? I feel terrible for their families.

[Message 4] Alex: They said it was some kind of accident, right?

[Message 5] Ben: That's what I heard. Awful.

[Message 6] Casey: Sunset...that's when it happened, right? I was home all evening.

[Message 7] Alex: Yeah, around sunset. Anyone know who the victims were?

[Message 8] Ben: One was a taxi driver, apparently. Name was Sam. The other, I think, a Corrections Officer called Mark.

[Message 9] Casey: Sam? Oh man, he drove me home last week. Always cheerful.

[Message 10] Alex: Wow, small world. I didn't know either of them personally.

[Message 11] Ben: I saw Casey buying Car accident (vehicular homicide) at the store yesterday

[Message 12] Casey: What, are you accusing me of something, Ben?

[Message 13] Ben: Just saying, you know? Bad timing.

[Message 14] Alex: Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. It was an accident, right?

[Message 15] Casey: Exactly! And I buy Car accident (vehicular homicide) every week for dinner.

[Message 16] Ben: Dinner? You eat Car accident (vehicular homicide) for dinner every week? Seems a bit much.

[Message 17] Casey: Figure of speech, Ben! Chill.

[Message 18] Alex: Anyway, did the cops say anything about what kind of accident?

[Message 19] Ben: Vehicular homicide, they said. Car accident (vehicular homicide).

[Message 20] Casey: Terrible. Must have been going way too fast.

[Message 21] Alex: I hate driving around sunset. The sun is always in my eyes.

[Message 22] Ben: Me too. It's dangerous.

[Message 23] Casey: True that. So, anyone doing anything fun this weekend? Need to take my mind off this.

[Message 25] Ben: Sounds good. Maybe I'll join.

[Message 26] Casey: Okay, I'll pass. Still shaken up.

[Message 27] Alex: Fair enough.

[Message 28] Ben: Later.

[Message 29] Casey: Later guys.

[Message 30] Alex: Hey Ben, you okay? You seemed a bit…off earlier.

[Message 31] Ben: Just tired, man. Long week.

[Message 32] Alex: Right. Listen, if you need anything, let me know.

[Message 33] Ben: Appreciate it, Alex.

[Message 34] Alex: No problem.

[Message 35] Casey: Anyone know how long they're going away for this?

[Message 36] Ben: Going away? Who's going away?

[Message 37] Casey: Just saying... for vehicular homicide and all. If it wasn't an accident.

[Message 38] Alex: Casey, stop it. You're making things weird.

[Message 39] Ben: Yeah, Casey, seriously. Lay off.

[Message 57] Ben: And...I just have a weird feeling.

[Message 61] Ben: Yeah, you're right.

[Message 62] Alex: Good.

[Message 63] Casey: So... Did anyone know Sam or Mark well?

[Message 64] Alex: Not really. You?

[Message 65] Casey: Nah. Just trying to understand what happened.

[Message 66] Ben: I think that it may have been an impulsive act of rage.

[Message 67] Alex: What makes you say that, Ben?

[Message 68] Ben: Just a hunch.

[Message 69] Casey: Hunch? Based on what?

[Message 70] Ben: Nothing. Forget I said anything.

[Message 71] Alex: Alright then.

[Message 72] Casey: You guys are acting so weird.

[Message 73] Ben: You're the one acting weird, Casey.

[Message 74] Alex: Come on, guys, let's just drop it.

[Message 75] Casey: Whatever.

[Message 76] Ben: Hey Alex, I had another thought.

[Message 77] Alex: What is it now, Ben?

[Message 78] Ben: About Casey. Remember how he always hated 3.  Taxi Driver?

[Message 79] Alex: Vaguely. What's your point?

[Message 80] Ben: Sam was a taxi driver. Just saying.

[Message 81] Alex: You’re reaching, Ben. Seriously.

[Message 82] Ben: Maybe.

[Message 83] Alex: Let the cops do their job. We're just gonna make things worse.

[Message 84] Ben: Fine.

[Message 85] Casey: I bought a new car today!

[Message 103] Alex: It's about Casey. And something I saw.

[Message 107] Alex: Dead serious.

[Message 108] Ben: We need to tell the cops.

[Message 112] Ben: Will do.

[Message 113] Casey: Did you guys hear the cops are looking for a witness elimination?

[Message 114] Alex: Yeah, I heard.

[Message 115] Ben: Why do you ask, Casey?

[Message 116] Casey: Just curious. Scary stuff.

[Message 117] Alex: Agreed.

[Message 118] Ben: Very scary.

[Message 119] Casey: Hope they catch him.

[Message 120] Alex: Me too.

[Message 121] Ben: Definitely.

[Message 122] Alex: Ben, I'm thinking of bailing on the bar tonight. I'm really not feeling it.

[Message 123] Ben: What? Why? You said you had something to tell me.

[Message 124] Alex: I know, but I think I need to process everything first. It's a lot to take in.

[Message 125] Ben: You can't just leave me hanging like this, Alex. This is important.

[Message 137] Alex: Night.

[Message 138] Ben: Night.

[Message 139] Alex: Ben, it's about the taxi driver, Sam. I overheard him talking about hurting her right before he went over there.

[Message 140] Ben: Who?

[Message 141] Alex: Casey. Sam overheard him talking about getting rid of him.

[Message 142] Ben: You're saying Sam knew Casey intended to hurt Mark?

[Message 143] Alex: That's what it sounded like. Sam looked nervous, like he knew too much.

[Message 144] Ben: This changes everything. This is not mercy killing due to severe suffering. This is murder. Casey knew.

[Message 13] Owen: Fair enough, Hamilton's a beast. Speaking of cars, anyone seen the new Porsche Taycan? It's electric but still looks amazing.
[Message 14] Hazel: I saw a review online. Looks super sleek.
[Message 15] River: Electric vehicles are the future, I suspect. Quieter, at least.
[Message 16] Liam: I saw one in Worcester the other day. It was beautiful! But give me a good old petrol engine any day. The sound!
[Message 17] Sophia: I agree about the sound. Electric cars are a bit too quiet for my taste.
[Message 18] Owen: Each to their own! My wife is pushing me to get a hybrid.
[Message 19] Hazel: Hybrids are a good compromise, right?
[Message 20] River: Practical, certainly. Lower emissions are a plus.
[Message 21] Liam: My old truck runs on diesel. Loud and proud! What do you drive, River?
[Message 22] Sophia: Liam, you and your truck!
[Message 23] Owen: I’m currently driving a Subaru Outback. Reliable and good for road trips.
[Message 24] Hazel: I have a Mini Cooper. Easy to park in the city.
[Message 25] River: I drive a Volvo. Safety is paramount.
[Message 26] Liam: A Volvo, eh? Sensible choice. Sophia, what about you?
[Message 27] Sophia: I have an older Honda Civic. It gets me from A to B.
[Message 28] Owen: Civics are bulletproof!
[Message 29] Hazel: Totally agree! They last forever.
[Message 30] River: Longevity is certainly a desirable characteristic in an automobile.
[Message 31] Liam: True that. My truck... well, it needs constant TLC. But I love it.
[Message 32] Sophia: Speaking of TLC, I need to get my car in for an oil change soon.
[Message 33] Owen: Reminds me, I need to rotate my tires.
[Message 34] Hazel: Anyone know a good mechanic in Worcester?
[Message 35] River: I've had positive experiences with Main Street Auto Repair.
[Message 36] Liam: I usually just fix things myself. Saves money.
[Message 37] Sophia: Liam, you're a lifesaver!
[Message 38] Owen: Handy to know. I'm all thumbs when it comes to car repairs.
[Message 39] Hazel: Me too! I wouldn't know where to start.
[Message 40] River: I prefer to delegate such tasks to professionals.
[Message 41] Liam: Alright, enough about car maintenance! Let's go race these go-karts!
[Message 42] Sophia: Yes! Let's do this!
[Message 43] Owen: Sounds good!
[Message 44] Hazel: I'm ready!
[Message 45] River: Lead the way.
[Message 46] Liam: Race you to the starting line!
[Message 47] Sophia: On your mark, get set, GO!
[Message 48] Owen: Whoa, Sophia's quick!
[Message 49] Hazel: I'm coming for you, Liam!
[Message 50] River: (Walking briskly) I'll observe for a moment. Enjoy yourselves.
[Message 51] Liam: Haha, I'm already in my kart! Getting ready to win!
[Message 52] Sophia: Don't get cocky, Liam!
[Message 53] Owen: Yeah, watch out for Sophia! She's got hidden skills.
[Message 54] Hazel: I'm terrible at directions, do you think I can still get a good time?
[Message 55] River: Certainly. Practice makes perfect. Simply follow the course markers.
[Message 56] Liam: Just follow the other karts, Hazel! Easy peasy!
[Message 57] Sophia: Focus, Hazel, focus!
[Message 58] Owen: Remember to brake before the corners!
[Message 59] Hazel: Good point! Thanks, Owen!
[Message 60] River: Calculated deceleration is key.
[Message 61] Liam: Alright, I think I'm gonna win this time.
[Message 62] Sophia: We'll see about that!
[Message 63] Owen: I'm betting on Sophia.
[Message 64] Hazel: I'm just hoping not to crash!
[Message 65] River: A commendable objective.
[Message 66] Liam: Hey, does anyone know where the best place to grab a pizza around here is?
[Message 67] Sophia: I think there’s a good place on Shrewsbury Street.
[Message 68] Owen: Yeah, Shrewsbury Street has a bunch of restaurants.
[Message 69] Hazel: I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!
[Message 70] River: A post-race repast sounds appealing.
[Message 71] Liam: Pizza it is then! After I win, of course.
[Message 72] Sophia: We'll see who's buying pizza!
[Message 73] Owen: This is gonna be a blast!
[Message 74] Hazel: I'm so glad we did this! Thanks for organizing, Liam!

444,"[Message 1] Alex: Good morning everyone! Ready for some funny story sharing this morning?
[Message 2] Jamie: Morning Alex! Always ready for a laugh!
[Message 3] River: Morning folks. Coffee in hand and ears open.
[Message 4] Sam: Morning all! Excited to hear what you've got.
[Message 5] Alex: Okay, I'll start. This happened on a camping trip last summer. I tried to cook pancakes on a portable stove and ended up with a smoky mess.
[Message 6] Jamie: Oh no! Did you at least salvage some for eating?
[Message 7] Alex: Maybe a few bites. Mostly charcoal though!
[Message 8] River: That sounds… memorable. I tried making s'mores once and set the marshmallow on fire. Completely engulfed in flames.
[Message 9] Sam: Classic! Everyone's done that at least once, right?
[Message 10] Jamie: Probably! Okay, my turn. I was on a first date once, and I tripped walking into the restaurant. Spilled my drink everywhere.
[Message 11] Alex: Oh, that's mortifying! Did you recover?
[Message 12] Jamie: Eventually! He was a good sport about it, thankfully.
[Message 13] River: Did you get a second date?
[Message 14] Jamie: Nope! Maybe the spilled drink was a bad omen.
[Message 15] Sam: My funniest first date involved a pigeon stealing my bread roll right off my plate.
[Message 16] Alex: A pigeon! That's hilarious and slightly traumatizing.
[Message 17] Sam: It was! I swear it looked me right in the eye before it swooped.
[Message 18] River: Okay, that wins for animal encounters on dates.
[Message 19] Alex: Definitely!
[Message 20] Jamie: So, Sam, any second date with the pigeon-involved individual?
[Message 21] Sam: Surprisingly, yes! We laughed about it for the rest of the night.
[Message 22] River: See? A good sense of humor is key.
[Message 23] Alex: Absolutely! Anyone else have a funny first date story?
[Message 24] Sam: River, anything come to mind?
[Message 25] River: Hmm, let me think... Oh! I once accidentally called my date by the wrong name the entire evening.
[Message 26] Jamie: Oh dear! How did you manage that?
[Message 27] River: I had been talking about someone else named similar things earlier in the day. Brain fart!
[Message 28] Alex: Did they ever find out?
[Message 29] River: I confessed at the end of the night. It was awkward, but they laughed.
[Message 30] Sam: Bravery points for confessing!
[Message 31] Jamie: Big time!
[Message 32] Alex: Speaking of bravery, has anyone tried a new hobby lately that turned into a funny disaster?
[Message 33] Jamie: I tried making sourdough bread. Let’s just say my kitchen looked like a flour bomb exploded.
[Message 34] River: I can relate. I attempted knitting and ended up with a tangled mess of yarn.
[Message 35] Sam: I decided to try gardening. The squirrels ate everything.
[Message 36] Alex: Ha! The squirrels are always the villains.
[Message 37] Jamie: They are! They taunt me from the trees.
[Message 38] River: Back to first dates, I saw a guy once wearing a full suit of armor to a restaurant.
[Message 39] Sam: A full suit of armor?! Was it Halloween?
[Message 40] River: Nope! Just a Tuesday night.
[Message 41] Alex: Maybe he was trying to impress someone with his… unique style?
[Message 42] Jamie: Or protecting himself from heartbreak?
[Message 43] Sam: Either way, memorable!
[Message 44] River: Very! It was hard to keep a straight face.
[Message 45] Alex: This reminds me of the time I tried to parallel park and ended up blocking an entire street.
[Message 46] Jamie: We’ve all been there! The parallel parking struggle is real.
[Message 47] Sam: Especially in Cleveland! Some of those spots are tiny.
[Message 48] River: Truth!
[Message 49] Alex: So true!
[Message 50] Jamie: Has anyone ever accidentally sent a text to the wrong person?
[Message 51] River: Oh, plenty of times. Usually something embarrassing.
[Message 52] Sam: I once sent a message complaining about my boss to my boss.
[Message 53] Alex: No way! What happened?
[Message 54] Sam: He actually laughed and said he appreciated the honesty.
[Message 55] Jamie: Wow! That’s a surprisingly good outcome.
[Message 56] River: Very lucky!
[Message 57] Alex: I once accidentally called my pharmacy and started singing ""Happy Birthday.""
[Message 58] Jamie: What?! Why?
[Message 59] Alex: I was supposed to call my mom. Wrong number.
[Message 60] Sam: That's amazing!
[Message 61] River: Pure gold!
[Message 62] Alex: I still cringe when I think about it.
[Message 63] Jamie: Don't worry, we're all laughing with you, not at you! Mostly.
[Message 64] Sam: So, anyone got weekend plans? Anything potentially funny in the works?
[Message 65] River: I'm attempting to bake a cake. Wish me luck.
[Message 66] Alex: Good luck! Maybe have a fire extinguisher handy.
[Message 67] Jamie: And a camera ready for the inevitable funny moments.
[Message 68] Sam: I'm going to try and learn to play pickleball. I foresee some awkward moments.
[Message 69] Alex: Pickleball! That's the sport everyone's obsessed with.
[Message 70] Jamie: Let us know how it goes!
[Message 71] River: Yes, pictures or it didn't happen!
[Message 72] Sam: Will do!
[Message 73] Alex: I'm going camping. Hopefully, no pancake incidents this time.
[Message 74] Jamie: Pack some emergency granola bars, just in case.
[Message 75] River: Solid advice!
[Message 76] Sam: Definitely.
[Message 77] Alex: Good call!
[Message 78] Jamie: Okay, back to funny stories... I once wore two different shoes to work and didn't realize it until lunchtime.
[Message 79] River: Been there! Done that!
[Message 80] Sam: The classic mismatched shoe blunder.
[Message 81] Alex: I’ve done that with socks!
[Message 82] Jamie: Socks are more forgivable, I think.
[Message 83] River: True!
[Message 84] Sam: Much less noticeable.
[Message 85] Alex: Unless they're neon green and bright pink.
[Message 86] Jamie: Fair point!
[Message 87] River: Okay, fun fact, did you know that honey never spoils?
[Message 88] Sam: Really? I did not know that.
[Message 89] Alex: Wow, that's interesting!
[Message 90] Jamie: Nature is amazing!
[Message 91] River: Random, I know, but I just saw it online and thought I'd share.
[Message 92] Sam: Appreciated! Always good to learn something new.
[Message 93] Alex: Agreed! Back to stories, though…I tripped over my own feet at a wedding once during the first dance.
[Message 94] Jamie: Oh no! Did you take anyone down with you?
[Message 95] Alex: Thankfully, no. But it was pretty embarrassing.
[Message 96] Sam: Did they stop the dance?
[Message 97] Alex: Briefly, but then everyone started laughing and we kept going.
[Message 98] Jamie: Good recovery!
[Message 99] River: Smooth save!
[Message 100] Sam: Did you at least get a good story out of it?
[Message 101] Alex: Absolutely! And now I'm sharing it with you all.
[Message 102] Jamie: Full circle!
[Message 103] River: It's the gift that keeps on giving.
[Message 104] Sam: Anyone have a funny story involving pets?
[Message 105] Jamie: My cat once got stuck in a Christmas tree.
[Message 106] Alex: Oh dear! Was it okay?
[Message 107] Jamie: Eventually! It took some coaxing to get her out.
[Message 108] River: My dog ate my homework once. Classic.
[Message 109] Sam: Mine tried to eat a bee. Not his smartest moment.
[Message 110] Alex: Ouch! Did he get stung?
[Message 111] Sam: Yep! Learned his lesson though.
[Message 112] Jamie: Animals are the best comedians, sometimes unintentionally.
[Message 113] River: Agreed!
[Message 114] Sam: Absolutely.
[Message 115] Alex: They definitely keep life interesting.
[Message 116] Jamie: Speaking of interesting, I saw a guy wearing a kilt at the grocery store yesterday.
[Message 117] River: Perfectly normal in some parts of the world!
[Message 118] Sam: True, but maybe not so much in Cleveland.
[Message 119] Alex: He was probably just comfortable.
[Message 120] Jamie: Maybe! It was definitely a memorable grocery run.
[Message 121] River: Did he have bagpipes?
[Message 122] Sam: Now that would have been a story!
[Message 123] Alex: I would have paid extra for that show.
[Message 124] Jamie: Me too!
[Message 125] River: Okay, last funny story from me. I once tried to bake cookies and forgot to add the sugar.
[Message 126] Sam: Ouch! Were they edible?
[Message 127] River: Technically, yes. Delicious? Definitely not.
[Message 128] Alex: We've all had baking fails.
[Message 129] Jamie: Practice makes perfect! Or at least makes less terrible.
[Message 130] Sam: I once tried to make a soufflé. It deflated instantly.
[Message 131] Alex: Soufflés are notoriously difficult.
[Message 132] Jamie: They are!
[Message 133] River: Okay, I think that's all the funny stories I have for now.
[Message 134] Sam: Same here. Thanks for sharing everyone!
[Message 135] Alex: Yeah, it was fun! Brightened my morning.
[Message 136] Jamie: Mine too! Always good for a laugh.
[Message 137] River: Definitely!
[Message 138] Sam: Have a great day everyone!
[Message 139] Alex: You too!
[Message 140] Jamie: Bye all!
[Message 141] River: See ya!
[Message 142] Sam: Later!
[Message 143] Alex: Alright, everyone have a productive day! And try not to have any funny mishaps.
[Message 144] Jamie: No promises!

446,"[Message 1] Amelia: Good morning, Hector! Made it to Sunset Bank finally. The line is kinda long. How’s your day going?
[Message 2] Hector: Morning, Amelia! Just about to start prepping for lunch service. Busy, busy!
[Message 3] Amelia: Lunch already? Time flies. What's on the menu today?
[Message 4] Hector: We're doing a grilled salmon with roasted vegetables. Simple but delicious!
[Message 5] Amelia: Sounds amazing! I'm stuck here, trying to deposit this check. So boring.
[Message 6] Hector: Banks, eh? Necessary evil. At least you’ll get it done.
[Message 7] Amelia: True. Thinking about our trip, though. Still excited about Santa Fe?
[Message 8] Hector: Absolutely! I was just looking at some fishing spots near Santa Fe last night.
[Message 9] Amelia: Ooh, tell me more! I'm imagining picturesque landscapes.
[Message 10] Hector: There's a place called the Pecos River. Apparently, it's a great spot for trout.
[Message 11] Amelia: Trout sounds… adventurous. I’ll stick to painting the scenery.
[Message 12] Hector: Fair enough! More trout for me then. Back to work, though. Gotta get those veggies roasting.
[Message 13] Amelia: Okay, chef! I'll let you get back to it. I'll update you on the bank situation.
[Message 14] Hector: Sounds good. Talk soon!
[Message 15] Amelia: Still in line… Ugh. I should have come earlier.
[Message 16] Amelia: Actually, what time were you thinking of leaving for Santa Fe?
[Message 17] Hector: Thinking we could leave early Thursday morning, get there by afternoon.
[Message 18] Amelia: Thursday works perfectly. Gives me time to finish that project at work.
[Message 19] Hector: Speaking of work, how’s that marketing campaign coming along?
[Message 20] Amelia: It’s… a challenge. We’re trying to reach a younger demographic.
[Message 21] Hector: Ah, the younger generation! Always changing. Any new strategies?
[Message 22] Amelia: We're focusing on social media, obviously. Lots of TikTok and Instagram.
[Message 23] Hector: TikTok! The dancing videos, right?
[Message 24] Amelia: Haha, yeah, and everything else. It’s a whole world.
[Message 25] Hector: I saw one the other day with a cat playing the piano.
[Message 26] Amelia: See? Endless possibilities!
[Message 27] Amelia: I just moved up a few spots in line! Almost there.
[Message 28] Hector: Progress! The little victories in life.
[Message 29] Amelia: Exactly! Small wins. Like getting a perfectly roasted vegetable.
[Message 30] Hector: You know it! The Maillard reaction is a beautiful thing.
[Message 31] Amelia: I have no idea what that is, but it sounds impressive.
[Message 32] Hector: It's the chemical reaction that makes things brown and delicious!
[Message 33] Amelia: Ah, the science of cooking! Fascinating.
[Message 34] Hector: Indeed. Back to the salmon! Need to get this crust perfect.
[Message 35] Amelia: Go get ‘em! I'll be free from the bank soon, I hope.
[Message 36] Hector: Let me know when you are. We can brainstorm Santa Fe activities!
[Message 37] Amelia: Definitely! Thinking about visiting some art galleries.
[Message 38] Hector: Sounds right up your alley. I'll check out the local markets.
[Message 39] Amelia: Perfect! We can meet up for dinner.
[Message 40] Hector: A plan is forming! I like it.
[Message 41] Amelia: Okay, almost at the teller! Wish me luck.
[Message 42] Hector: Good luck! May the banking gods be with you.
[Message 43] Amelia: Haha, thanks! I need all the help I can get.
[Message 44] Amelia: Deposited! Freedom!
[Message 45] Hector: Hallelujah! Escape from the clutches of the bank.
[Message 46] Amelia: Seriously. Now, what about that dinner spot in Santa Fe? Any ideas?
[Message 47] Hector: I saw a place called Geronimo. It’s supposed to be really good.
[Message 48] Amelia: Geronimo… I'll look it up. Sounds promising.
[Message 49] Hector: It’s on Canyon Road, so we can walk there from the galleries.
[Message 50] Amelia: Perfect location! Okay, I’m liking this plan more and more.
[Message 51] Hector: Me too! Getting excited about the trip. Need a break.
[Message 52] Amelia: I know, right? Work has been crazy lately.
[Message 53] Hector: Tell me about it. Restaurant life is never dull.
[Message 54] Amelia: Always something happening. Always someone needing something.
[Message 55] Hector: Exactly! The joys of customer service.
[Message 56] Amelia: You’re a chef, though! Shouldn't you be yelling in the kitchen?
[Message 57] Hector: Only when necessary! I try to keep the peace.
[Message 58] Amelia: A peaceful chef. I like it.
[Message 59] Hector: Keeps the food tasting better.
[Message 60] Amelia: Makes sense! So, back to Santa Fe… what kind of art are you hoping to see?
[Message 61] Hector: Honestly, I just enjoy wandering around and seeing what catches my eye.
[Message 62] Amelia: I get that. Sometimes the best art is the unexpected kind.
[Message 63] Hector: Precisely! And maybe I'll find a nice pottery bowl for my kitchen.
[Message 64] Amelia: A practical souvenir! I approve.
[Message 65] Hector: Functionality is key! Plus, it'll remind me of the trip every time I use it.
[Message 66] Amelia: A great idea. I might look for a new canvas.
[Message 67] Hector: Perfect! We'll have our Santa Fe mementos.
[Message 68] Amelia: Okay, I need to get back to work. But this was a nice distraction.
[Message 69] Hector: Agreed! Always good to chat. Have a productive afternoon!
[Message 70] Amelia: You too! Good luck with the lunch rush.
[Message 71] Hector: Thanks! I'll need it. Talk later!
[Message 72] Amelia: Bye!
[Message 73] Amelia: Ugh, back to emails...
[Message 74] Hector: How's the email situation looking?
[Message 75] Amelia: Overflowing. I think they multiply when I'm not looking.
[Message 76] Hector: That's how it always feels. Like little email gremlins.
[Message 77] Amelia: Exactly! Email gremlins attacking my inbox.
[Message 78] Hector: Perhaps some herbal tea is in order?
[Message 79] Amelia: That sounds amazing, actually. Any recommendations?
[Message 80] Hector: Chamomile is always a classic. Or maybe some lavender.
[Message 81] Amelia: Lavender sounds lovely. Calming.
[Message 82] Hector: It is. I actually have a lavender plant growing in my garden.
[Message 83] Amelia: How wonderful! I've always wanted a garden.
[Message 84] Hector: It's very rewarding. And you can grow your own herbs!
[Message 85] Amelia: Maybe that's my next project after the marketing campaign.
[Message 86] Hector: Sounds like a good plan. Baby steps!
[Message 87] Amelia: Speaking of steps, I should probably take one towards those emails.
[Message 88] Hector: The emails await! Good luck, brave warrior.
[Message 89] Amelia: Thanks! I'll need all the encouragement I can get.
[Message 90] Hector: You've got this! Channel your inner resilience.
[Message 91] Amelia: Resilience, right! I can do this!
[Message 92] Hector: Absolutely. And remember, Santa Fe is just around the corner.
[Message 93] Amelia: That's my motivation! Santa Fe and art galleries.
[Message 94] Hector: And trout. Don't forget the trout!
[Message 95] Amelia: Okay, okay! Trout included.
[Message 96] Hector: Excellent! Now go conquer those emails!
[Message 97] Amelia: Will do! Talk soon!

[Message 99] Amelia: Okay, one hour later and only slightly less emails...
[Message 100] Hector: One step at a time! Progress is progress.
[Message 101] Amelia: True. It’s just… relentless.
[Message 102] Hector: I understand. Lunch rush is finally dying down here.
[Message 103] Amelia: Glad to hear it! I bet you're exhausted.
[Message 104] Hector: A little. But it's a good kind of tired. The satisfied chef kind.
[Message 105] Amelia: I can imagine. Creating something delicious for people.
[Message 106] Hector: Exactly! That's the best part.
[Message 107] Amelia: What's your favorite dish to make?
[Message 108] Hector: Ooh, that's a tough one. I love making paella. It's so colorful and flavorful.
[Message 109] Amelia: Paella! That sounds complicated.
[Message 110] Hector: It can be, but it's worth the effort. The saffron is key.
[Message 111] Amelia: Saffron… expensive stuff, right?
[Message 112] Hector: It is! But a little goes a long way. It gives it that beautiful golden color.
[Message 113] Amelia: Sounds like a culinary masterpiece.
[Message 114] Hector: I like to think so! Maybe I'll make it for you sometime.
[Message 115] Amelia: I would love that!
[Message 116] Hector: Consider it a date! A paella date.
[Message 117] Amelia: Perfect! I'm holding you to it.
[Message 118] Hector: You got it! Now, I need to start thinking about dinner.
[Message 119] Amelia: Dinner already? The day is flying by.
[Message 120] Hector: It is! Time to plan the next culinary adventure.
[Message 121] Amelia: What's on the menu for tonight?
[Message 122] Hector: Thinking of doing a roasted chicken with rosemary and garlic.
[Message 123] Amelia: Classic and comforting. Sounds wonderful.
[Message 124] Hector: Exactly! Simple, but done right.
[Message 125] Amelia: I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.
[Message 126] Hector: Come on over! I'll save you a plate.
[Message 127] Amelia: Haha, I wish! Still stuck in email land.
[Message 128] Hector: Ah, the email gremlins are relentless.
[Message 129] Amelia: They are! I'm starting to suspect they're sentient.
[Message 130] Hector: Don't give them any ideas!
[Message 131] Amelia: Too late! I think they're plotting.
[Message 132] Hector: Stay strong! We're almost to the weekend.
[Message 133] Amelia: That's what I'm holding onto. The sweet, sweet weekend.
[Message 134] Hector: And Santa Fe! Don't forget Santa Fe!
[Message 135] Amelia: Never! Santa Fe is my beacon of hope.
[Message 136] Hector: Exactly! So, keep fighting the good fight.
[Message 137] Amelia: Will do! I'm determined to conquer these emails.
[Message 138] Hector: Atta girl! Show them who's boss.
[Message 139] Amelia: I'm unleashing my inner marketing manager!
[Message 140] Hector: That's the spirit!
[Message 141] Amelia: Okay, back to the trenches! Wish me luck.
[Message 142] Hector: Good luck, Amelia! I'm rooting for you.
[Message 143] Amelia: Thanks, Hector! Talk later!
[Message 144] Hector: Later!
[Message 145] Amelia: Freedom! I've escaped the email abyss!
[Message 146] Hector: Victory is yours! The gremlins have been vanquished!
[Message 147] Amelia: For now, at least. They'll be back.
[Message 148] Hector: But you'll be ready for them!
[Message 149] Amelia: You know it! So, what time should I be ready on Thursday?
[Message 150] Hector: How about 7 AM? That way we can avoid the worst of the traffic.
[Message 151] Amelia: 7 AM it is! I'll set my alarm.
[Message 152] Hector: Perfect! I'll have coffee ready.
[Message 153] Amelia: You're the best! I'm so looking forward to this.
[Message 154] Hector: Me too! It's going to be a great trip.
[Message 155] Amelia: I can feel it! Okay, I’m officially done for the day.
[Message 156] Hector: Excellent! Time to relax and recharge.
[Message 157] Amelia: Exactly! Maybe I'll start packing.
[Message 158] Hector: Good idea! I need to gather my fishing gear.
[Message 159] Amelia: So exciting! It’s almost here!
[Message 160] Hector: Almost! Just a couple more days.
[Message 161] Amelia: I'm already dreaming of Santa Fe.
[Message 162] Hector: Me too! It's going to be wonderful.
[Message 163] Amelia: Well, I'm off to relax. Thanks for the chat, Hector!
[Message 164] Hector: Anytime, Amelia! Always a pleasure.
[Message 165] Amelia: You too! Have a great evening!
[Message 166] Hector: You as well! Enjoy your evening!
[Message 167] Amelia: I will! Goodnight!
[Message 168] Hector: Goodnight, Amelia!
[Message 169] Amelia: Just finished packing! Feeling good.
[Message 170] Hector: Awesome! I've got my fishing gear all set.
[Message 171] Amelia: Ready for adventure!
[Message 172] Hector: Absolutely! Bring on Santa Fe!
[Message 173] Amelia: I’m so ready!
[Message 174] Hector: Sweet dreams, Amelia! See you Thursday!
[Message 175] Amelia: Sweet dreams to you too, Hector! Can’t wait!",0,

[Message 1] Alex: ""Hey, did you hear about what happened at the Botanical Garden?""
[Message 2] Jamie: ""Yeah, it's all over the news. Crazy stuff. Two people dead.""
[Message 3] Riley: ""Botanical Garden? What happened?""
[Message 4] Alex: ""Murder, apparently. I think the police are investigating. A man named Frank and a young woman, Sarah.""
[Message 5] Jamie: ""I heard it was Frank, the drug dealer, and Sarah, the security guard. Sad.""
[Message 6] Riley: ""Omg, that's awful! I was just there last week!""
[Message 7] Alex: ""I know, right? Makes you think.""
[Message 8] Jamie: ""Did they say how they died?""
[Message 9] Riley: ""Probably some gang violence, knowing Frank.""
[Message 10] Alex: ""They're saying it was a fall, but suspicious circumstances.""
[Message 11] Jamie: ""A fall? Like, an accident?""
[Message 12] Riley: ""Midday at a public place? Sounds sus. What you up to today Alex?""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Just catching up on some work. You know how it is. Just got back from grocery shopping.""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""Yeah, always something. I'm trying to finish this project. Deadlines are killer.""
[Message 15] Riley: ""Tell me about it. I have a mountain of laundry to do.""
[Message 16] Alex: ""Anyone know Frank or Sarah?""
[Message 17] Jamie: ""I think I saw Frank around sometimes. Always seemed shady. Maybe he had it coming to him.""
[Message 18] Riley: ""Jamie! That's harsh. Sarah didn't deserve that.""
[Message 19] Jamie: ""I didn't mean it like that, Riley. Just saying... Frank was probably into some bad stuff. Sarah just got caught in the crossfire.""
[Message 20] Alex: ""True, but still awful. Imagine being pushed.""
[Message 21] Riley: ""Guys, this is creeping me out. Let's talk about something else.""
[Message 22] Jamie: ""Agreed. Anyone watching that new show on Netflix?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Which one? The true crime doc?""
[Message 24] Jamie: ""Yeah! It's so messed up.""
[Message 25] Riley: ""I'm more into comedies right now. Need something lighthearted.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""Fair enough. So, Riley, laundry getting done?""
[Message 27] Riley: ""Slowly but surely. I saw on Facebook that the police have a few suspects, wonder if that is true""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""Probably just standard procedure. They have to look at everyone.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Hope they catch whoever did it.""
[Message 30] Riley: ""Me too. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 31] Jamie: ""Well, if they're caught, they deserve it.""
[Message 32] Alex: ""Think they'll release any more details?""
[Message 33] Riley: ""Maybe. The news is being pretty tight-lipped.""
[Message 34] Jamie: ""Probably to protect the investigation.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Makes sense. I had to buy Pushing from a height at the store yesterday, that's all i did.""
[Message 36] Riley: ""Did you see anything suspicious at the garden yesterday, Jamie?""
[Message 37] Jamie: ""I wasn't even near the garden, Riley! Why are you asking me that?""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Easy, Riley. Just curious, I guess.""
[Message 39] Riley: ""Sorry, Jamie. Just on edge, I guess. I heard Frank was talking about hurting Sarah right before.""
[Message 40] Jamie: ""It's fine. I understand. This whole thing is unsettling.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""I heard that Frank was ending a prolonged period of abuse against a friend. Its the only thing that comes to mind.""
[Message 42] Riley: ""Wow, if true, that's messed up. Abuse is never the answer.""
[Message 43] Jamie: ""Agreed. Sounds like Frank had a lot of enemies.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Maybe. Or maybe someone just wanted something he had. Like that business competitor thing.""
[Message 45] Riley: ""Speaking of wanting something, I could really go for some pizza.""
[Message 46] Jamie: ""Pizza sounds good. What kind?""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Pepperoni, always a classic.""
[Message 48] Riley: ""Agreed. I'm starving. Let's order one later?""
[Message 49] Jamie: ""Sounds like a plan. Anyone else you think could be involved?""
[Message 50] Alex: ""Who knows. Chicago's a big city.""
[Message 51] Riley: ""True. Could be anyone with a grudge.""
[Message 52] Jamie: ""Or someone who knew about Frank's… business dealings.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Right. Maybe Sarah knew something too.""
[Message 54] Riley: ""Poor Sarah. She was always so nice.""
[Message 55] Jamie: ""Yeah, always had a smile on her face.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""I bet the manager at the garden is freaking out.""
[Message 57] Riley: ""I'd be surprised if they weren't. Major PR nightmare.""
[Message 58] Jamie: ""Definitely. Hope they catch the people responsible soon.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Me too. This is making me want to stay inside forever.""
[Message 60] Riley: ""I know, right? I'm locking all my doors tonight.""
[Message 61] Jamie: ""Same here. Stay safe, you guys.""
[Message 62] Alex: ""You too. Night.""
[Message 63] Riley: ""Night.""
[Message 64] Jamie: ""Hey, Alex, quick question. Did you by any chance see my green jacket at your place? I cant find it anywhere""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Nope, haven't seen it. Maybe you left it at the gym?""
[Message 66] Jamie: ""Good call, I'll check tomorrow. You think it was a planned hit, not a random thing?""
[Message 67] Alex: ""With Frank being a Drug Dealer, probably planned. I saw him leave the building at Midday the other day and never saw him again. Maybe this is why.""
[Message 68] Riley: ""guysss, can we talk about something else. This is freaking me outttt.""
[Message 69] Jamie: ""Sorry, Riley! Just speculating. Watching a funny movie now, so that's helping.""
[Message 70] Alex: ""Yeah, same here. Distraction is key.""
[Message 71] Riley: ""Agreed. Pizza is still on the table, right?""
[Message 72] Jamie: ""Of course! Pizza will solve everything.""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Well, not *everything*, but it'll help.""
[Message 74] Riley: ""True that. What if Frank had fired Sarah, maybe none of this would have happened""
[Message 75] Jamie: ""Could be. We're all just guessing at this point. The police have to figure it all out.""
[Message 76] Alex: ""Yeah, hopefully they have some leads.""
[Message 77] Riley: ""I hope they don't get the death penalty, that is too much.""
[Message 78] Jamie: ""Well, depends on the circumstances, right? If it was premeditated…""
[Message 79] Alex: ""True. I am aware that Sarah tried to talk him out of it, wonder what that means.""
[Message 80] Riley: ""Omg, Alex stop it! You are making me feel worse!""
[Message 81] Jamie: ""Alex, maybe lay off the true crime for tonight?""
[Message 82] Alex: ""Sorry, sorry. Just thinking out loud.""
[Message 83] Riley: ""Okay, good. Pizza it is then!""
[Message 84] Jamie: ""Perfect. Let's order in an hour?""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Sounds good to me. Want to order together?""
[Message 86] Riley: ""Yeah, let's do a group call. I need to see your faces!""
[Message 87] Jamie: ""Haha, okay. An hour it is.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""See you then.""
[Message 89] Riley: ""Bye!""
[Message 90] Jamie: ""Later!""
[Message 91] Alex: ""Did you hear about that guy being arrested for drug possession yesterday?""
[Message 92] Jamie: ""No, where?""
[Message 93] Alex: ""Downtown. Apparently, he was carrying a lot.""
[Message 94] Jamie: ""Wow. Seems like the cops are cracking down.""
[Message 95] Riley: ""Maybe they are trying to distract from the murder""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Maybe. Or maybe it's just a coincidence.""
[Message 97] Jamie: ""Hard to say. So many things happening all the time.""
[Message 98] Riley: ""True. It's overwhelming.""
[Message 99] Alex: ""Yeah. Let's just focus on the pizza later.""
[Message 100] Jamie: ""Agreed. Pizza therapy is needed.""
[Message 101] Riley: ""Definitely. My shout! So excited.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""Perfect! Can't wait.""
[Message 103] Jamie: ""Same here. Talk soon!""
[Message 104] Riley: ""Okay, gotta run and decide what I am going to order, pizza wise!""

448,"[Message 1] Sarah: ""Hey Mark, did you hear about what happened at Public Beach?""
[Message 2] Mark: ""No, what's up?""
[Message 3] Sarah: ""Someone was murdered. A young journalist, apparently.""
[Message 4] Mark: ""Seriously? That's awful. I was there earlier that day actually. Crazy.""
[Message 5] Sarah: ""Yeah, they said it was midday. A 16 year old. His name was Kevin.""
[Message 6] Mark: ""Midday? I was grabbing lunch around then. Who was it?""
[Message 7] Sarah: ""Kevin. So sad. Makes you think.""
[Message 8] Mark: ""Totally. Did they catch anyone?""
[Message 9] Sarah: ""Not yet, I don't think. They're interviewing people.""
[Message 10] Mark: ""Wow. I hope they find who did it quickly.""
[Message 11] Sarah: ""Me too. I heard Emily knew him. Maybe you should text her?""
[Message 12] Mark: ""Good idea. Talk soon!""
[Message 13] Emily: ""Hey, what's up?""
[Message 14] Mark: ""Sarah told me about Kevin. So sorry, Emily. How are you holding up?""
[Message 15] Emily: ""It's been rough. I can't believe it. He was so young and creative.""
[Message 16] Mark: ""I know. Did you know anything was wrong? Any enemies?""
[Message 17] Emily: ""Not really. He had a disagreement with Donna about some article he was working on.""
[Message 18] Mark: ""Donna? That's surprising. She's usually so calm.""
[Message 19] Emily: ""Yeah, but he apparently wrote something she didn't like. About her past. It really affected her hatred stemming from prejudice, or so i heard.""
[Message 20] Mark: ""Hmm. Do you think it's connected?""
[Message 21] Emily: ""I don't know. I hope not. But she was furious with him. She really wanted to get rid of him, I overheard her talking to herself.""
[Message 22] Mark: ""Okay. That's... something. Did you tell the police?""
[Message 23] Emily: ""Yeah, I mentioned it. But I doubt it's her. Maybe someone else at the paper?""
[Message 24] Mark: ""Maybe. It's just... weird. Anyway, let me know if you need anything, Em.""
[Message 25] Emily: ""Thanks, Mark. I appreciate it.""
[Message 26] Donna: ""Hey, have you seen my Drowning in a bathtub anywhere? I can't find it.""
[Message 27] Paul: ""No, sorry Donna. Check the usual spots?""
[Message 28] Donna: ""Yeah, I already did. I need it for this project I'm working on.""
[Message 29] Paul: ""Good luck finding it. So, about that raise…""
[Message 30] Donna: ""I'm working on it. Give it time. Things are crazy right now, especially with Kevin…""
[Message 31] Paul: ""Right, the journalist. Terrible.""
[Message 32] Donna: ""Terrible. He was a good kid, despite the… article.""
[Message 33] Paul: ""So, back to the raise…""
[Message 34] Donna: ""Paul, seriously, can we talk about this later? I'm stressed.""
[Message 35] Paul: ""Fine, fine. Just let me know.""
[Message 36] Donna: ""Will do.""
[Message 37] Emily: ""Hey, do you know where Donna was yesterday at midday?""
[Message 38] Sarah: ""Midday? No, why?""
[Message 39] Emily: ""Just curious. She seemed really on edge today.""
[Message 40] Sarah: ""I think she was buying Drowning in a bathtub at the store. I saw her at the pharmacy around then.""
[Message 41] Emily: ""Oh, okay. Weird.""
[Message 42] Sarah: ""Why weird?""
[Message 43] Emily: ""No reason. Just… thinking out loud.""
[Message 44] Sarah: ""Okay. Well, let me know if you need anything.""
[Message 45] Emily: ""Will do. Thanks.""
[Message 46] Mark: ""Hey Emily, any updates?""
[Message 47] Emily: ""Not really. Police are still investigating. It's awful.""
[Message 48] Mark: ""I can't imagine. Just know that I'm here for you.""
[Message 49] Emily: ""Thanks. You're a good friend.""
[Message 50] Mark: ""Always. Did the police ask you about Donna?""
[Message 51] Emily: ""Yeah, briefly. I told them what I knew.""
[Message 52] Mark: ""Okay. Just making sure.""
[Message 53] Emily: ""Anything else on your mind?""
[Message 54] Mark: ""No, just concerned. This whole thing is messed up.""
[Message 55] Emily: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 56] Donna: ""Hey Paul, can you come to my office? Need to discuss something.""
[Message 57] Paul: ""Coming now.""
[Message 58] Donna: ""Close the door.""
[Message 59] Paul: ""Okay… what's up?""
[Message 60] Donna: ""Just wanted to say that the raise is definitely happening. Just give me some time. I need to get rid of him.""
[Message 61] Paul: ""That's great to hear! Thanks, Donna.""
[Message 62] Donna: ""No problem. Just… keep things between us for now.""
[Message 63] Paul: ""Of course. Mum's the word.""
[Message 64] Sarah: ""Did you ever find your Drowning in a bathtub, Donna?""
[Message 65] Donna: ""Yeah, found it. Thanks for asking.""
[Message 66] Sarah: ""No problem.""
[Message 67] Sarah: ""I saw you leave the building at midday yesterday, right?""
[Message 68] Donna: ""Yeah, I went to grab lunch. Why?""
[Message 69] Sarah: ""Just curious. The police are asking about everyone's whereabouts.""
[Message 70] Donna: ""Oh. Well, I was at the deli down the street.""
[Message 71] Sarah: ""Okay. Just wanted to check.""
[Message 72] Donna: ""Everything okay, Sarah?""
[Message 73] Sarah: ""Yeah, fine. Just a bit shaken up about Kevin.""
[Message 74] Donna: ""Me too. Tragic.""
[Message 75] Mark: ""Hey, just thinking about Kevin. Did he have any family around here?""
[Message 76] Emily: ""I think his parents live out of state. He was pretty much on his own here.""
[Message 77] Mark: ""That's even sadder. Hope they find out who did this.""
[Message 78] Emily: ""Me too. He always hated 4. Journalist.""
[Message 79] Mark: ""What do you mean?""
[Message 80] Emily: ""Just… he felt misunderstood. He was so passionate about his work.""
[Message 81] Mark: ""Right. I remember.""
[Message 82] Donna: ""This whole thing is a mess. I hope they're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 83] Paul: ""Yeah, me too. They deserve it.""
[Message 84] Donna: ""I need a vacation after this.""
[Message 85] Paul: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 86] Emily: ""Hey, I can't sleep. Thinking about Kevin.""
[Message 87] Mark: ""I know. It's rough. Just try to relax.""
[Message 88] Emily: ""Easier said than done. This wouldn't have happened if he listened to my advice about the article.""
[Message 89] Mark: ""Don't blame yourself, Emily. It's not your fault.""
[Message 90] Emily: ""I know, but…""
[Message 91] Mark: ""No buts. Just focus on getting some rest.""
[Message 92] Emily: ""Okay. Thanks, Mark.""
[Message 93] Sarah: ""Donna seems really stressed lately.""
[Message 94] Paul: ""Yeah, she is. Lot on her plate.""
[Message 95] Sarah: ""More than usual, you think?""
[Message 96] Paul: ""Maybe. I don't know. Why?""
[Message 97] Sarah: ""No reason. Just observing.""
[Message 98] Paul: ""Okay.""
[Message 99] Donna: ""I need to find a new hat. Ugh, so much to do.""
[Message 100] Paul: ""Yeah, I can imagine.""
[Message 101] Donna: ""This whole Kevin thing has thrown everything off.""
[Message 102] Paul: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 103] Donna: ""Hope they catch the guy soon.""
[Message 104] Paul: ""Me too.""
[Message 105] Emily: ""Hey, quick question. Did Kevin ever mention anyone with burn scars on their hands?""
[Message 106] Mark: ""Burn scars? No, never.""
[Message 107] Emily: ""Okay, thanks.""
[Message 108] Mark: ""Why? Did the police say something?""
[Message 109] Emily: ""No, just something I remembered.""
[Message 110] Mark: ""Okay. Be careful, Emily.""
[Message 111] Emily: ""Always am.""
[Message 112] Sarah: ""Hey, do you know what kind of Drowning in a bathtub Donna bought?""
[Message 113] Paul: ""No idea. Why does it matter?""
[Message 114] Sarah: ""Just curious. She seemed really particular about it.""
[Message 115] Paul: ""Maybe it's a fancy one.""
[Message 116] Sarah: ""Maybe.""
[Message 117] Paul: ""Anyway, gotta run. Later.""
[Message 118] Sarah: ""Bye.""

449,"[Message 1] Alex: Anyone else stuck in this waiting room? Feels like forever.
[Message 2] Jamie: Yeah, Alex. Been here about an hour. Teacher-student conference gone wrong.
[Message 3] River: Oh, man. Conferences are the worst. I remember those days.
[Message 4] Quinn: Tell me about it, River. Mine's about my niece. Apparently, she's ""expressing herself"" too much.
[Message 5] Sam: Expressing herself how, Quinn? Glitter bombs?
[Message 6] Quinn: Worse, Sam. Loud political opinions at the tender age of 10.
[Message 7] Jamie: Ah, a chip off the old block! (Or trying to be.)
[Message 8] Alex: Haha, kids are something else. My little one just wants to dance all the time.
[Message 9] River: Dancing is great! Healthy outlet.
[Message 10] Sam: Totally agree, River. Keeps 'em out of trouble. What kind of dancing, Alex?
[Message 11] Alex: Anything and everything, Sam. Mostly just flailing around with abandon. Makes me smile.
[Message 12] Jamie: Sounds adorable, Alex. My grandkids mostly just stare at screens.
[Message 13] River: We need to get them back outside! Fresh air and sunshine.
[Message 14] Quinn: Easier said than done, River. This generation is glued to their devices.
[Message 15] Sam: It's a real struggle. I try to limit screen time but it's a constant battle.
[Message 16] Alex: I hear you, Sam. We try family board game night once a week. Sometimes it works.
[Message 17] Jamie: Board games! That's a classic. Monopoly always ends in tears at my house.
[Message 18] River: We prefer Scrabble. Less cutthroat.
[Message 19] Quinn: Scrabble sounds sophisticated. I'm more of a Cards Against Humanity kinda person. (When the kids aren't around, obviously!)
[Message 20] Sam: Haha, Quinn! That's a brave choice.
[Message 21] Alex: Okay, now I’m just thinking about how long it’s been since I’ve been dancing!
[Message 22] Jamie: You and me both, Alex. My hips aren't what they used to be, though.
[Message 23] River: Age is just a number, Jamie! Get out there and shake it!
[Message 24] Quinn: River's right! Life's too short to not dance.
[Message 25] Sam: Alright, alright, you've convinced me. Maybe a dance class is in order.
[Message 26] Alex: Let's all go! We could make it a group thing.
[Message 27] Jamie: I'm tentatively in. Depends on the music. No heavy metal, please.
[Message 28] River: Count me in too! I'm always up for a good boogie.
[Message 29] Quinn: I'm so down! Dancing sounds like a great stress reliever.
[Message 30] Sam: Okay, Alex, you're officially in charge of finding a class.
[Message 31] Alex: Challenge accepted! I'll do some research.
[Message 32] Jamie: Thanks, Alex. Appreciate it.
[Message 33] River: So, back to family stuff…anyone else have upcoming holidays to plan for?
[Message 34] Quinn: Oh god, don't remind me. Thanksgiving at my place this year.
[Message 35] Sam: Ouch, Quinn. That's a lot of pressure.
[Message 36] Alex: Yeah, my sympathies. We're doing a potluck to ease the burden.
[Message 37] Jamie: Smart move, Alex. Potlucks are the way to go.
[Message 38] River: We're skipping Thanksgiving this year and going on a cruise.
[Message 39] Quinn: Lucky you, River! That sounds amazing.
[Message 40] Sam: A cruise sounds fantastic. Maybe next year.
[Message 41] Alex: I'm jealous, River. A cruise would be amazing.
[Message 42] Jamie: I’ve always wanted to go on a cruise, never got around to it.
[Message 43] River: There's still time, Jamie! Life is an adventure.
[Message 44] Quinn: True that, River. You're an inspiration.
[Message 45] Sam: Speaking of inspiration…anyone watching that new documentary about the environment?
[Message 46] Alex: I started it, Sam, but it was a bit depressing.
[Message 47] Jamie: I try to avoid those. I get too anxious.
[Message 48] River: It's important to be informed, but I understand the anxiety.
[Message 49] Quinn: I'm all about sustainable living, but I'm not perfect.
[Message 50] Sam: Nobody is, Quinn. We're all just trying our best.
[Message 51] Alex: Exactly. Small changes can make a big difference.
[Message 52] Jamie: Like recycling! I'm militant about recycling.
[Message 53] River: Good for you, Jamie! Every little bit helps.
[Message 54] Quinn: I'm trying to reduce my plastic consumption. It's harder than it looks.
[Message 55] Sam: It really is. So much packaging!
[Message 56] Alex: Okay, back to dancing... I found a beginner salsa class nearby. Anyone interested?
[Message 57] Jamie: Salsa? I'm not sure I can handle that much hip movement.
[Message 58] River: Haha, Jamie, you might surprise yourself!
[Message 59] Quinn: Salsa sounds fun! I'm in.
[Message 60] Sam: Me too! Let's do it.
[Message 61] Alex: Awesome! I'll send you guys the details.
[Message 62] Jamie: Great, thanks Alex!
[Message 63] River: This waiting room just got a whole lot more interesting.
[Message 64] Quinn: Agreed! Distracting myself from the impending doom of the teacher conference.
[Message 65] Sam: You got this, Quinn. Just breathe.
[Message 66] Alex: Yeah, Quinn, remember to stay calm.
[Message 67] Jamie: Focus on the salsa class!
[Message 68] River: Think happy thoughts!
[Message 69] Quinn: Thanks, guys. I appreciate the support.
[Message 70] Sam: Anytime, Quinn. We're all in this together.
[Message 71] Alex: Did anyone else see that crazy sunset on the way here?
[Message 72] Jamie: Oh, I missed it. Traffic was awful.
[Message 73] River: It was stunning. Pinks and oranges everywhere.
[Message 74] Quinn: Jersey City sunsets are the best.
[Message 75] Sam: They really are. Makes the city feel a little less chaotic.
[Message 76] Alex: Totally agree, Sam. A moment of peace.
[Message 77] Jamie: Well, I hope this conference is a moment of peace for Quinn!
[Message 78] River: Good luck, Quinn! Let us know how it goes.
[Message 79] Quinn: Will do! Thanks again, everyone.

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, Chloe. Just tired. Long week at the office.
[Message 3] Maya: Office? You're still doing that catering gig, right?
[Message 4] Liam: Right, catering. Brain fart.
[Message 5] Chloe: How's it going? Any interesting events lately?
[Message 6] Liam: Nah, same old. Weddings, corporate things. Nothing exciting.
[Message 7] Maya: Did you hear about what happened Overpass last night?
[Message 8] Chloe: Yeah, it’s awful. Poor Alex and Jordan.
[Message 9] Liam: Terrible. Two people… just gone.
[Message 10] Maya: Alex was always so cynical, but Jordan didn't deserve that.
[Message 11] Chloe: What do you think happened? Any leads?
[Message 12] Maya: Rumor is it was a robbery gone wrong.
[Message 13] Liam: Could be. Overpass isn’t the safest area.
[Message 14] Chloe: True. Still, it's shocking.
[Message 15] Maya: I heard the security guard, Alex, was arguing with someone a few days ago. Big fight.
[Message 16] Liam: Really? About what?
[Message 17] Maya: No clue. Just overheard snippets. Something about money, maybe?
[Message 18] Chloe: You think that has anything to do with it?
[Message 19] Maya: Who knows? Could be a coincidence.
[Message 20] Liam: I need to get some sleep. Talk later.
[Message 21] Chloe: Sure, Liam. Get some rest.
[Message 22] Maya: Night.
[Message 23] Chloe: Maya, you think Liam knows more than he’s letting on?
[Message 24] Maya: He’s been acting weird lately. Distant.
[Message 25] Chloe: Yeah, I noticed.
[Message 26] Maya: Remember how he hated Alex? Always complaining about his attitude.
[Message 27] Chloe: Yeah, but hating someone and… well…
[Message 28] Maya: I know, I know. Just saying.
[Message 29] Chloe: What about Sarah? She worked with Jordan at the newspaper.
[Message 30] Maya: Good point. She might know something.
[Message 31] Chloe: I’ll text her.
[Message 32] Maya: Let me know what she says.
[Message 33] Chloe: Hey Sarah, you okay? Heard about Jordan.
[Message 34] Sarah: Devastated, Chloe. She was a good friend. And a great journalist.
[Message 35] Chloe: Did she ever mention anyone who might want to hurt her?
[Message 36] Sarah: She was working on a big story, about some local politician's shady dealings.
[Message 37] Chloe: Whoa, seriously?
[Message 38] Sarah: Yeah. She said she was close to exposing him. ""I intended to get rid of him"", she said.
[Message 39] Chloe: Do you know who the politician was?
[Message 40] Sarah: I’m not sure. She kept it pretty close to the vest. Afraid of leaks.
[Message 41] Chloe: Maybe that’s why this happened. To silence her.
[Message 42] Sarah: It’s possible. Hope they don't get the death penalty if it is.
[Message 43] Chloe: I hope they find out who did this. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 44] Sarah: Me too. Justice for Jordan. And Alex, even if I didn't know him well.
[Message 45] Chloe: Thanks, Sarah. Let me know if you remember anything else.
[Message 46] Sarah: Will do.
[Message 47] Chloe: Maya, Sarah said Jordan was about to expose a politician.
[Message 48] Maya: See? I told you there was more to it than a robbery.
[Message 49] Chloe: This could be huge.
[Message 50] Maya: We should tell the police.
[Message 51] Chloe: Already did. Gave them Sarah's name too.
[Message 52] Maya: Good.
[Message 53] Liam: Hey, what are you guys talking about?
[Message 54] Chloe: Just about the murders.
[Message 55] Liam: Oh. Right. Still can't believe it.
[Message 56] Maya: You seemed pretty quick to write it off as a robbery, Liam.
[Message 57] Liam: Well, what else could it be? It’s Augusta.
[Message 58] Chloe: Jordan was about to expose a politician.
[Message 59] Liam: A politician? Seriously?
[Message 60] Maya: That's what we heard.
[Message 61] Liam: Wow. That changes things.
[Message 62] Chloe: You okay, Liam? You’re sweating.
[Message 63] Liam: Just… hot in here.
[Message 64] Maya: You saw him leave the building at Late Evening, didn't you, Liam? You were at the scene.
[Message 65] Liam: What? No! I was at home, watching TV.
[Message 66] Chloe: You sure about that, Liam?
[Message 67] Liam: Positive. Why would I lie?
[Message 68] Chloe: I don't know, Liam. You tell me.
[Message 69] Maya: Maybe he was just trying to prevent the victim from exposing a secret.
[Message 70] Liam: Guys, this is crazy. I had nothing to do with it.
[Message 71] Chloe: What were you watching on TV last night?
[Message 72] Liam: Uh… I don’t remember.
[Message 73] Maya: See? He’s lying.
[Message 74] Liam: I’m not lying! I’m just… stressed.
[Message 75] Chloe: Stressed about what, Liam?
[Message 76] Liam: Just… everything. This whole situation.
[Message 77] Maya: He always hated Alex. Maybe it was revenge for a past wrong.
[Message 78] Liam: I didn’t… I wouldn’t…
[Message 79] Chloe: You wouldn’t what, Liam? Finish the sentence.
[Message 80] Liam: I wouldn’t hurt anyone.
[Message 81] Maya: Except Alex, right? You always said you wanted to get rid of him.
[Message 82] Liam: That was just talk! I didn’t mean it literally.
[Message 83] Chloe: But you knew Alex, right? You knew about his tremor in hands?
[Message 84] Liam: What's that got to do with anything?
[Message 85] Chloe: Nothing, just curious.
[Message 86] Maya: You should call the police, Liam. Tell them everything you know.
[Message 87] Liam: I already told them everything!
[Message 88] Chloe: Did you tell them you were at Overpass last night?
[Message 89] Liam: No! Because I wasn’t!
[Message 90] Maya: Just admit it, Liam. It’ll be easier in the long run.
[Message 91] Liam: I have nothing to admit!
[Message 92] Chloe: Well, someone needs to pay for what happened to Alex and Jordan.
[Message 93] Maya: I think the police are already on their way, Liam.
[Message 94] Liam: What? Why?

[Message 4] Jordan: ""Sarah and Emily? Were they the victims?""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Yeah, the Corrections Officer and the Security Guard. Brutal.""
[Message 6] Jamie: ""I saw Emily yesterday, she was buying Drowning in a bathtub cleaner at the store. Weird.""
[Message 7] Riley: ""I can't believe it. Sarah was always so anxious, this is just terrible.""
[Message 8] Jordan: ""Anxious? Why?""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Work stuff, I think. Corrections is a tough job.""
[Message 10] Jamie: ""Anyone know anything more than what's on TV?""
[Message 11] Riley: ""Just rumors. Don't want to spread anything without knowing for sure.""
[Message 12] Jordan: ""Smart. This could get messy.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Speaking of messy, anyone catch the game last night?""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""Nah, too tired. Heard it was a nail-biter though.""
[Message 15] Riley: ""Total snooze-fest if you ask me.""
[Message 16] Jordan: ""Agreed. I was working late.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Doing what?""
[Message 18] Jordan: ""Just some accounting stuff. End-of-month is always a killer.""
[Message 19] Jamie: ""You an accountant? I never knew that, Jordan.""
[Message 20] Riley: ""Me neither!""
[Message 21] Jordan: ""Yep. Keeps me out of trouble.""
[Message 22] Alex: ""So, back to the Movie Theater... Think they'll catch the person?""
[Message 23] Jamie: ""They better. What kind of monster does that?""
[Message 24] Riley: ""I saw him leave the building at Dead of Night. I thought it was weird at the time.""
[Message 25] Jordan: ""Who did you see, Riley?""
[Message 26] Riley: ""Just some guy. Can't really describe him. It was dark.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Could you pick him out of a lineup?""
[Message 28] Riley: ""Maybe? I don't know.""

[Message 37] Jamie: ""So, about the Movie Theater... What was the motive?""
[Message 38] Riley: ""I heard Sarah fired someone recently.""
[Message 39] Jordan: ""Fired someone? Who?""
[Message 40] Alex: ""That's a good question.""
[Message 41] Jamie: ""Maybe that's the link.""
[Message 42] Riley: ""Could be. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened. Though, you know, that is a strong statement that might not be 100% true.""
[Message 43] Jordan: ""I always thought Sarah was too harsh. Maybe it was justified though.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""I knew Sarah. She wasn't always right but she always did what she thought was right. ""
[Message 45] Jamie: ""Yeah, Emily didn't deserve that either. She was so kind.""

[Message 55] Jordan: ""Sorry, didn't mean to offend anyone. Just trying to lighten the mood.""

[Message 45] CHLOE: True. But still, it's hard to believe.
[Message 46] LIAM: So we have Sarah who had motive, and Mark who needed money.
[Message 47] ANNA: Let's not jump to conclusions. The police will figure it out.
[Message 48] BEN: Yeah, but it’s fun to speculate.
[Message 49] CHLOE: It's not fun, Ben. Someone is dead.
[Message 50] LIAM: Ben, chill. This is serious.
[Message 51] ANNA: Agreed. Respect for Jamie.
[Message 52] BEN: Sorry, guys. Didn't mean to be insensitive.
[Message 53] CHLOE: It’s ok. Just… let’s be mindful.
[Message 54] LIAM: So, movie night. Any suggestions?
[Message 55] ANNA: How about a comedy? We need to laugh.
[Message 56] BEN: I'm down. I'll bring extra popcorn.
[Message 57] CHLOE: Sounds good. I’m bringing wine.
[Message 58] LIAM: Perfect. This Jamie thing is stressing me out.
[Message 59] ANNA: Me too. Especially since they mentioned Asphyxiation by strangulation. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 60] BEN: Yeah, that's rough.
[Message 61] CHLOE: Makes you think. What if you were there? What would you do?
[Message 62] LIAM: Call the cops, obviously.
[Message 63] ANNA: Agreed. No question.
[Message 64] BEN: Depends on the situation.
[Message 65] CHLOE: What do you mean, Ben?
[Message 66] LIAM: Yeah, elaborate.
[Message 67] ANNA: That sounds suspicious.
[Message 68] BEN: Relax, guys. I just mean, if it was self-defense or something.
[Message 69] CHLOE: Self-defense against Jamie? Come on.
[Message 70] LIAM: Yeah, Jamie was harmless.
[Message 71] ANNA: Exactly. Ben, you’re being weird again.
[Message 72] BEN: I’m just saying… things aren’t always as they seem.
[Message 73] CHLOE: What are you implying?
[Message 74] LIAM: Seriously, Ben, you know something?
[Message 75] ANNA: Spill it. Now.
[Message 76] BEN: Ok, ok! Just… Mark told me Jamie owed him money.
[Message 77] CHLOE: Owed him money? For what?
[Message 78] LIAM: This is getting interesting.
[Message 79] ANNA: Mark never mentioned that to me.
[Message 80] BEN: Maybe he didn't want you to know.
[Message 81] CHLOE: So Mark needed money, and Jamie owed him money…
[Message 82] LIAM: And Jamie is now dead.
[Message 83] ANNA: Guys, this is serious. We need to tell the police.
[Message 84] BEN: I don’t want to get involved.
[Message 85] CHLOE: Ben! A person is dead!
[Message 86] LIAM: Agreed. Police need to know.
[Message 87] ANNA: We all go together. Ben, you're coming too.
[Message 88] BEN: Fine, fine. But I'm not saying anything else.
[Message 89] CHLOE: Just tell them what Mark said. That's all.
[Message 90] LIAM: And that Mark has been acting weird.
[Message 91] ANNA: Agreed. Let's go now.
[Message 92] BEN: Can we at least get the popcorn first?
[Message 93] CHLOE: Ben! Seriously?!
[Message 94] LIAM: Movie night is cancelled. Let’s go to the police station.
[Message 95] ANNA: Agreed. The sooner the better.
[Message 96] BEN: Fine. But I'm driving.
[Message 97] CHLOE: Whatever. Just get us there safely.
[Message 98] LIAM: Agreed. Let's go.
[Message 99] ANNA: This is insane. Poor Jamie.
[Message 100] BEN: I still can't believe this is happening.
[Message 101] CHLOE: Me neither. It's like a nightmare.
[Message 102] LIAM: Hopefully, they catch whoever did this soon.
[Message 103] ANNA: And they get what they deserve. Hope they don't get the death penalty.
[Message 104] BEN: Yeah. Long time in jail at least.
[Message 105] CHLOE: I heard someone saw Mark buying rope Asphyxiation by strangulation at the store last week. Is it true?
[Message 106] LIAM: Chloe, where did you hear that?
[Message 107] ANNA: That's a serious accusation.
[Message 108] BEN: Seriously, Chloe. You can't just say things like that.
[Message 109] CHLOE: I just overheard someone talking. I don't know if it's true or not.
[Message 110] LIAM: Well, don't spread rumors. That's how innocent people get hurt.
[Message 111] ANNA: Agreed. Chloe, be careful what you say.
[Message 112] BEN: This is getting out of hand.
[Message 113] CHLOE: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause trouble.
[Message 114] LIAM: It's okay. Just be mindful.
[Message 115] ANNA: Let's just focus on telling the police what we know.
[Message 116] BEN: Agreed. The less we speculate, the better.
[Message 117] CHLOE: Okay. Let's just go.
[Message 118] LIAM: Agreed. Ben, are you ready?
[Message 119] ANNA: Yeah, let's get this over with.
[Message 120] BEN: Almost. Just gotta grab my jacket.
[Message 121] CHLOE: Okay. Hurry up.
[Message 122] LIAM: We're waiting.
[Message 123] ANNA: Come on, Ben.
[Message 124] BEN: Okay, I'm here. Let's go.
[Message 125] CHLOE: Finally.
[Message 126] LIAM: Let's roll.
[Message 127] ANNA: This is so surreal.
[Message 128] BEN: Tell me about it.
[Message 129] CHLOE: I can't believe this is happening.
[Message 130] LIAM: Me neither.
[Message 131] ANNA: Poor Jamie deserved better.
[Message 132] BEN: Agreed.
[Message 133] CHLOE: Let's just hope justice is served.
[Message 134] LIAM: Agreed.
[Message 135] ANNA: I just want this to be over.
[Message 136] BEN: Me too.
[Message 137] CHLOE: We'll get through this together.
[Message 138] LIAM: Agreed.

[Message 22] Alex: ""My parents always seemed more stressed than I was.""

[Message 9] Alex: ""It's a new onboarding system for new hires. Should streamline the whole process.""
[Message 10] Casey: ""Sounds useful. Wish they had something like that when I started teaching.""
[Message 11] Jordan: ""Seriously! Paperwork was a nightmare at my old job.""
[Message 12] Alex: ""Exactly! Hoping this makes things easier for everyone. Business negotiation is a big part of it, convincing people it's worth the investment.""
[Message 13] Casey: ""I bet. Getting people to embrace change is always a challenge.""

[Message 19] Casey: ""Honestly, it's tough. But I try to dedicate at least an hour a day. Small steps, you know?""
[Message 20] Jordan: ""Good strategy. I'm the same with gardening. Even just 15 minutes of weeding makes a difference.""

[Message 25] Casey: ""So, Alex, what's the biggest hurdle in your project launch?""
[Message 26] Alex: ""Getting buy-in from all the department heads. Everyone has their own way of doing things.""
[Message 27] Jordan: ""Oh, I know that feeling. I have to constantly justify HR policies to different teams.""

[Message 15] Alex: ""That was rough. But murder? Seems extreme. Dale's always been a bit unstable though...""
[Message 16] Jordan: ""Unstable is an understatement. I heard him saying he intended to make Brenda pay for what she did to him right before he went over there last night.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""That's... concerning. We should tell the cops.""
[Message 18] Jordan: ""Already did. Just passing along info. Speaking of cops, you remember Sam, the trans woman? She was one of the victims, right?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Yeah, so messed up. Seemed like a really kind person. What was she even doing at the Coffee Shop? Was she on a break or something?""
[Message 20] Jordan: ""I don't know. I was under the impression that the punishment for these crimes is severe.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Probably. They're going away for a long time for this, whoever did it.""
[Message 22] Jordan: ""Hey, you wouldn't happen to know why someone would use a Impalement with a sharp object, would you?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""No! Why would you even ask me that? That is a weird question to ask right now. Anyway, you know how you thought Kai needed money? I heard they might be getting a huge inheritance soon.""
[Message 24] Jordan: ""Oh, so the money thing was a red herring. Good to know. What will the police do?""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Probably investigate everyone. Hope they find the real killer fast. I am terrified.""
[Message 26] Jordan: ""Me too. So, lawnmower tomorrow, or no?""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Haha, classic you. Still thinking about that? Maybe just leave it at his door?""
[Message 28] Jordan: ""True. Less interaction. Maybe I should also look into some self defense classes. Or getting a Impalement with a sharp object. Just kidding!""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Seriously, Jordan? Not funny. I'm getting off this convo. It's making me uncomfortable.""
[Message 30] Jordan: ""Okay, okay, chill. Bad joke. Trivia tomorrow, still on?""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Yeah, but let's not talk about the Coffee Shop thing, okay? I need a break from it.""
[Message 32] Jordan: ""Agreed. New topic. You see that article about the meteorite that landed?""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Yeah, crazy! Think it's aliens?""
[Message 34] Jordan: ""Could be! Anyway, gotta run. Talk tomorrow. Stay safe.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""You too.""
[Message 36] Jordan: ""Oh, one last thing. Did you know Kai used to work for Brenda? She fired them a few months ago.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Really? I thought they were new. That's another motive right there.""
[Message 38] Jordan: ""Yep. Connecting the dots. Later.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Later.""

458,"[Message 1] Alex: Good morning, everyone! Anyone else up crazy early to get to the post office before the rush?
[Message 2] Ben: Morning, Alex! Yeah, thought I'd beat the crowds. Beautiful sunrise though.
[Message 3] Casey: Morning! Agreed, Ben. Sunrise is stunning. Thinking about that volunteer opportunity at the community garden later this week.
[Message 4] Dale: Morning all. Volunteer work? Tell me more, Casey.
[Message 5] Casey: They need help weeding and planting on Thursday afternoon. Figured it'd be a nice way to spend some time outdoors.
[Message 6] Alex: Community garden sounds nice. I've been meaning to get more involved. Hiking is great, but it's a solo activity.
[Message 7] Ben: Gardening is good for the soul. Plus, fresh veggies!
[Message 8] Dale: Thursday afternoons are usually free for me. What time are we talking?
[Message 9] Casey: I think it's from 2 pm to 5 pm. I can double-check.
[Message 10] Alex: Sounds doable. I'm in!
[Message 11] Ben: Maybe. Depends on this software bug I'm chasing. Keeps me up at night!
[Message 12] Dale: I feel that, Ben. Tech issues are never fun.
[Message 13] Casey: Ben, you deserve a break! Come garden with us!
[Message 14] Ben: Tempting, very tempting. I'll see how the week goes.
[Message 15] Alex: What about you, Dale? Solid yes?
[Message 16] Dale: Yep, count me in! It's been too long since I've gotten my hands dirty.
[Message 17] Casey: Awesome! So, Alex and Dale are confirmed. Ben, we'll keep you updated on the veggie situation.
[Message 18] Ben: Appreciate it! Maybe I can bring some homemade bread to share afterwards?
[Message 19] Alex: Homemade bread? Now you're talking!
[Message 20] Dale: Sounds delicious, Ben!
[Message 21] Casey: Perfect! Bread and garden-fresh tomatoes…dreamy.
[Message 22] Alex: Okay, now I'm hungry. Anyone grabbing coffee after this post office run?
[Message 23] Ben: I'm in for coffee. Need fuel for the bug hunt.
[Message 24] Dale: Coffee sounds great. Let's go to that new place on Hennepin.
[Message 25] Casey: Hennepin sounds good! I'll meet you guys there after I mail this package.
[Message 26] Alex: Perfect! See you soon.
[Message 27] Ben: Later!
[Message 28] Dale: See ya!
[Message 29] Casey: Speaking of volunteering… has anyone mentored a new employee lately?
[Message 30] Alex: I'm actually mentoring a junior project manager right now. It's been…interesting.
[Message 31] Ben: Ah, mentoring. I remember those days. A lot of patience required!
[Message 32] Dale: Patience is an understatement! Especially with Gen Z.
[Message 33] Casey: What's been challenging, Alex?
[Message 34] Alex: Mostly getting her to understand the importance of clear communication. Emails are her enemy, apparently.
[Message 35] Ben: Haha, emails. My generation practically lives in them. Times change!
[Message 36] Dale: I still prefer a phone call sometimes. Gets the message across faster.
[Message 37] Casey: I agree, Dale. Sometimes a quick call avoids a lot of back-and-forth.
[Message 38] Alex: I've been trying to encourage her to pick up the phone more. Baby steps.
[Message 39] Ben: Have you tried pairing her with someone who's good at communication? A peer mentor, maybe?
[Message 40] Alex: That's a good idea, Ben. I'll suggest it to my manager.
[Message 41] Dale: Peer mentoring can be really effective. They speak the same language, so to speak.
[Message 42] Casey: Definitely! And they can learn from each other's strengths.
[Message 43] Alex: Exactly. I think that could be a game-changer.
[Message 44] Ben: Glad I could help! Now back to those bugs…
[Message 45] Dale: Good luck, Ben! May the force be with you.
[Message 46] Casey: Break a leg, Ben! (Figuratively, of course!)
[Message 47] Alex: Speaking of volunteering, I also saw a notice about needing volunteers for the animal shelter.
[Message 48] Ben: Oh, I love animals! But I'm allergic to cats.
[Message 49] Dale: Animal shelters are always in need of help. Good cause.
[Message 50] Casey: Maybe you could volunteer in a dog-walking program, Ben?
[Message 51] Ben: That's an idea! I'll look into it.
[Message 52] Alex: They also need people to help with administrative tasks, if that's more your speed.
[Message 53] Ben: Hmm, paperwork. That might be less exciting than coding.
[Message 54] Dale: But important!
[Message 55] Casey: Every little bit helps!
[Message 56] Alex: True! Plus, you get to be around cute animals.
[Message 57] Ben: Okay, you've convinced me. I'll at least check out their website.
[Message 58] Dale: That's the spirit!
[Message 59] Casey: Wonderful!
[Message 60] Alex: By the way, Dale, are you still taking those dance classes?
[Message 61] Dale: Haha, yes! Still trying to keep up with the youngsters.
[Message 62] Ben: That's fantastic! Always good to stay active.
[Message 63] Casey: I've always wanted to learn to dance. Maybe you could give me some pointers, Dale!
[Message 64] Dale: I'd be happy to! We could even go to a social dance sometime.
[Message 65] Alex: That sounds fun! I'm terrible, but I'm always up for a laugh.
[Message 66] Ben: I'd probably trip over my own feet. But I'd enjoy watching!
[Message 67] Casey: This sounds like a plan!
[Message 68] Alex: Okay, community garden Thursday, maybe animal shelter for Ben, and a dance lesson for Casey. We're getting organized!
[Message 69] Ben: Multi-tasking at its finest!
[Message 70] Dale: Sounds good to me!
[Message 71] Casey: Love it! Now, off to get that coffee!
[Message 72] Alex: See you guys there!
[Message 73] Ben: On my way!
[Message 74] Dale: Coming!
[Message 75] Alex: Just saw Maria at the post office, she said she might join us in the garden!
[Message 76] Casey: Great! More the merrier!
[Message 77] Ben: Awesome!
[Message 78] Dale: Fantastic! This is shaping up to be a great volunteering event!
[Message 79] Casey: Agreed! Looking forward to it.

[Message 65] Anya: I'm calling the police now.
[Message 66] Chloe: Good. Let me know what they say.
[Message 67] Anya: Will do.
[Message 68] Liam: Hey guys, you still up?
[Message 69] Chloe: Just about to head to bed. What's up?
[Message 70] Anya: Yeah, almost asleep.
[Message 71] Liam: Just wanted to say…I’m really shaken up by this.
[Message 72] Chloe: We all are, Liam.
[Message 73] Anya: It's a terrible thing.
[Message 74] Liam: Yeah. Terrible. Hey, Anya, did you ever hear Samira talking about anyone…troubling?
[Message 75] Anya: Troubling? No, not really. Why?
[Message 76] Liam: Just wondering if she had any enemies or something.
[Message 77] Chloe: Why would she have enemies? She seemed nice.
[Message 78] Liam: You never know, right? People hide things.
[Message 79] Anya: True. But I didn't hear anything.
[Message 80] Chloe: Me neither.
[Message 81] Liam: Okay. Just a thought.
[Message 82] Anya: Get some rest, Liam.
[Message 83] Chloe: Yeah, night.
[Message 84] Liam: Night.
[Message 85] Anya: He’s totally trying to deflect.
[Message 86] Chloe: I know! He’s aware that he is under pressure. What a creep.
[Message 87] Anya: The police are on their way to his place.
[Message 88] Chloe: Good. Hopefully, they’ll find something.
[Message 89] Anya: Me too.
[Message 90] Chloe: Keep me updated.
[Message 91] Anya: Always will.
[Message 92] Chloe: This is insane.
[Message 93] Anya: Completely.
[Message 94] Liam: Hey, you guys still awake?
[Message 95] Anya: What is it, Liam?
[Message 96] Chloe: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 97] Liam: The police are here.
[Message 98] Anya: …
[Message 99] Chloe: …
[Message 100] Liam: They want to ask me some questions about Omar and Samira.
[Message 101] Anya: Just be honest, Liam.
[Message 102] Chloe: Yeah, tell them everything you know.
[Message 103] Liam: I will. I just…I’m scared.
[Message 104] Anya: Don't be scared if you have nothing to hide.
[Message 105] Chloe: Exactly.
[Message 106] Liam: Right. Right.
[Message 107] Anya: We’re here for you, Liam. No matter what.
[Message 108] Chloe: Yeah, we are.
[Message 109] Liam: Thanks. That means a lot. I saw him leave the building at Night.
[Message 110] Anya: Who are you talking about?
[Message 111] Chloe: Yes, who?
[Message 112] Liam: Omar, I saw him leave the Mosque. I failed to call 911 after he left. I thought he was okay.
[Message 113] Anya: What?! Why didn't you say anything before?!
[Message 114] Chloe: Liam, you need to tell the police this NOW.
[Message 115] Liam: I'm going to.
[Message 116] Anya: Good.
[Message 117] Chloe: Let us know what happens.
[Message 118] Liam: I will. Thanks, guys. For everything.

463,"[Message 1] Alex: Good morning, everyone! Ready to talk sports? The sun is just rising here at the Bookstore in Gilbert.
[Message 2] Jordan: Morning, Alex! Always ready for sports talk. Especially with coffee involved.
[Message 3] Casey: Morning! Coffee and sports, a winning combo. What's on the agenda today?
[Message 4] Alex: Thinking maybe some MLB spring training talk? Opening Day is right around the corner!
[Message 5] Jordan: Ooh, yes! I'm cautiously optimistic about the Dodgers this year. Big changes.
[Message 6] Casey: Dodgers always seem to be in the conversation. My team, the Angels, well... they're the Angels.
[Message 7] Alex: (chuckles) True, Casey. But there's always hope! What about you, Jordan? Any particular players you're excited to see?
[Message 8] Jordan: Mookie Betts, always. And I'm curious to see how Ohtani performs this year under the pressure.
[Message 9] Casey: Ohtani’s a phenomenon. He’s worth watching, regardless of what team you root for.
[Message 10] Alex: Agreed. Speaking of, anyone watching the college basketball tournaments? March Madness is heating up!
[Message 11] Jordan: I've got a bracket, but I'm already regretting some of my picks. So many upsets!
[Message 12] Casey: Same here! My bracket is busted. I just enjoy watching the games. The energy is electric.
[Message 13] Alex: Absolutely. That buzzer-beater last night was insane! Makes you wonder how those kids handle that pressure.
[Message 14] Jordan: Seriously! Speaking of pressure, I have my niece's teacher-student conference later today. Talk about pressure!
[Message 15] Casey: Oh, good luck with that, Jordan! Hope it goes well.
[Message 16] Alex: Teacher conferences can be tricky. Any specific concerns you're anticipating?
[Message 17] Jordan: Just general progress, I think. She's been a little distracted lately. Probably because of March Madness!
[Message 18] Casey: Haha, maybe! Okay, back to sports - anyone following the NHL playoffs race?
[Message 19] Alex: I keep an eye on it. The Western Conference is especially tight this year.
[Message 20] Jordan: I don’t follow hockey as closely, but I know it’s getting down to the wire.
[Message 21] Casey: My team is a long shot, but hey, a girl can dream! What about soccer? Any interest in the MLS season starting?
[Message 22] Alex: I enjoy watching the occasional MLS game. The atmosphere at some of those stadiums is amazing.
[Message 23] Jordan: I've been meaning to get into soccer more. I appreciate the athleticism of the players.
[Message 24] Casey: It's a great sport! Lots of action. Anyone remember that amazing goal from last season?
[Message 25] Alex: Which one are you thinking of? There were so many good ones!
[Message 26] Casey: The one where the player did that bicycle kick from outside the box!
[Message 27] Jordan: Wow, sounds incredible! I’ll have to look that up.
[Message 28] Alex: I think I know which one you mean. It was definitely a highlight reel play.
[Message 29] Casey: Exactly! SportsCenter worthy for sure. Anyway, what other sports are you guys into?
[Message 30] Alex: I mostly stick to hiking, personally. Less competitive, more relaxing.
[Message 31] Jordan: Hiking sounds lovely! I need to get out more. All this sports talk makes me want to be active.
[Message 32] Casey: Right? It’s inspiring! I'm thinking of joining a recreational volleyball league.
[Message 33] Alex: That sounds like fun! Great way to stay active and meet new people.
[Message 34] Jordan: I might have to check that out too. Volleyball seems like a good social sport.
[Message 35] Casey: Definitely! It’s pretty laid back. Okay, changing the subject slightly - anyone have any good book recommendations lately? Being at a bookstore, I feel obligated to ask.
[Message 36] Alex: I just finished a really interesting biography about Amelia Earhart.
[Message 37] Jordan: Ooh, I love biographies! I'll add that to my list. I'm currently reading a novel about a fashion designer.
[Message 38] Casey: Fashion designer, that's cool! I'm in the middle of a book about climate change. Pretty heavy stuff.
[Message 39] Alex: Important stuff, though. Back to sports, I just saw an article about how NIL deals are impacting college athletics. Thoughts?
[Message 40] Jordan: It's a whole new world. I'm not sure if I like it, to be honest. It feels like it's changing the spirit of the game.
[Message 41] Casey: I agree. It's definitely a complicated issue. On one hand, these athletes deserve to be compensated. On the other hand…
[Message 42] Alex: Exactly. It raises a lot of questions about fairness and equality.
[Message 43] Jordan: I wonder how it will affect recruiting in the long run. Will it just be about who can offer the most money?
[Message 44] Casey: Possibly. It could create a huge divide between the haves and have-nots.
[Message 45] Alex: It's going to be interesting to see how it all plays out. Well, I should probably get going. Gotta head to the office.
[Message 46] Jordan: Already? Time flies! I need to get ready for that conference.
[Message 47] Casey: Yeah, I need to run some errands. Thanks for the sports talk, everyone!
[Message 48] Alex: You too! Have a good day.
[Message 49] Jordan: Good luck with your volleyball league, Casey!
[Message 50] Casey: Thanks! And good luck with the teacher conference, Jordan!
[Message 51] Jordan: I appreciate it! Wish me luck!
[Message 52] Alex: Will do! See you both later.
[Message 53] Casey: Bye, Alex! Bye, Jordan!
[Message 54] Jordan: Bye, Alex and Casey!
[Message 55] Alex: Alright, have a great rest of the morning!
[Message 56] Jordan: You too!
[Message 57] Casey: You as well! And thanks again!
[Message 58] Alex: No problem, anytime!
[Message 59] Casey: Okay, seriously gotta go now!
[Message 60] Jordan: Later!",0,

[Message 3] Casey: ""Morning! I’m here and caffeinated! Let's do it!""
[Message 4] Dana: ""Good morning all. Just arrived, looking forward to a refreshing walk.""
[Message 5] Erin: ""Hi everyone! Sorry I'm a few minutes late, train was delayed.""
[Message 6] Alex: ""No worries, Erin! We just started. So, Ben, how about a brisk walk instead? ""
[Message 7] Ben: ""Brisk I can handle, Alex. Brisk sounds good.""
[Message 8] Casey: ""Brisk is perfect! I need to burn off these weekend calories.""
[Message 9] Dana: ""Are we discussing the book club selection after the walk, or should we reschedule?""
[Message 10] Erin: ""I can stay after for a bit to discuss the book.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Let's plan for a quick book discussion after, Dana. Say, 30 minutes?""
[Message 12] Ben: ""30 minutes sounds reasonable.""
[Message 13] Casey: ""Sounds good to me too. What are we walking at today's pace? ""
[Message 14] Dana: ""I'm flexible, whatever the group prefers.""
[Message 15] Erin: ""Happy with whatever pace. Been doing some extra weightlifting lately so i might be slower!""
[Message 16] Alex: ""Okay, let's aim for a moderate pace for the first loop, then maybe a slightly faster one if everyone's feeling up to it?""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Sounds like a plan, Alex. Moderate it is.""
[Message 18] Casey: ""Perfect! Anyone have any good workout playlists they can share? My usual one is getting stale.""
[Message 19] Dana: ""I mainly listen to podcasts while I walk, but I can look for some playlists later.""
[Message 20] Erin: ""I've got a good 80s power ballad one. Might not be for everyone though!""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Haha, Erin, that sounds...interesting. I'm more of a classical music person myself. Keeps me calm.""
[Message 22] Ben: ""Classical, huh? I prefer nature sounds, birds chirping, the wind in the trees… ""
[Message 23] Casey: ""I'm all about high-energy pop to keep me motivated.""
[Message 24] Dana: ""Different strokes for different folks! That's what makes it interesting.""
[Message 25] Erin: ""Definitely! Speaking of interesting, did anyone see that article about the benefits of walking backwards?""
[Message 26] Alex: ""Walking backwards? Never heard of it!""
[Message 27] Ben: ""Sounds like a recipe for disaster, Alex. I’ll stick to walking forward.""
[Message 28] Casey: ""I saw that! Apparently it helps with balance and coordination.""
[Message 29] Dana: ""I'd be afraid of tripping!""
[Message 30] Erin: ""Me too! Maybe on a treadmill though?""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Maybe we should stick to the path for now, no backward walking experiments today.""
[Message 32] Ben: ""Agreed. Especially given my knees.""
[Message 33] Casey: ""Haha, definitely agreed. So, about that book club…""
[Message 34] Dana: ""Yes, the book. I found the protagonist's motivations rather unclear.""
[Message 35] Erin: ""I thought the same. It felt a bit rushed in the middle.""
[Message 36] Alex: ""I thought the writing style was beautiful, even if the plot had some holes.""
[Message 37] Ben: ""I struggled to get through it, to be honest. It didn't really grab me.""
[Message 38] Casey: ""I enjoyed it, but I agree it wasn't perfect.""
[Message 39] Dana: ""Perhaps we can delve deeper into the character analysis after our walk. ""
[Message 40] Erin: ""Sounds good! Alright team let's get walking! ""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Alright, let's move! Enjoy the scenery everyone.""
[Message 42] Ben: ""Beautiful gardens, always a pleasure.""

[Message 62] Ben: ""I've heard they're good for posture, but I can't imagine standing all day.""

[Message 2] Alex: Heard it was something bad. Cops everywhere.
[Message 3] River: OMG! Was it…Jamison? I saw them there yesterday.
[Message 4] Kai: Jamison? I hope they're okay. I saw that person give corrections to a few skaters. 
[Message 5] Alex: Don't know, River. Just saw it on the news. Explosion, they said.
[Message 6] River: An explosion?! At Skate Park? That's insane!
[Message 7] Kai: Explosion?! Was anyone hurt? Seriously worried now.
[Message 8] Alex: One person dead. That's all they're saying.
[Message 9] River: Oh my god…that’s awful. Poor family.
[Message 10] Kai: This is terrible. Really hope they catch whoever did it.
[Message 11] Alex: Me too. This city's getting crazy.
[Message 12] River: Remember when we were talking about how stubborn Jamison was? This is messed up.
[Message 13] Kai: Yeah, I feel like someone knew about their occupation.
[Message 14] Alex: I need a distraction, anyone wanna go to that new cafe downtown?
[Message 15] River: Not today, Alex. I’m still processing this.
[Message 16] Kai: Me neither. I'm staying in tonight.
[Message 17] Alex: Suit yourselves. Just trying to lighten the mood.
[Message 18] River: I saw Sasha at the grocery store yesterday. She looked stressed.
[Message 19] Kai: Sasha? Why stressed?
[Message 20] Alex: Probably just life stuff. Sasha always seems stressed.
[Message 21] River: I don’t know… she was buying a bunch of cleaning supplies. Like, industrial-strength stuff.
[Message 22] Kai: Cleaning supplies? That’s weird.
[Message 23] Alex: Maybe she's just spring cleaning early?
[Message 24] River: Maybe. But it seemed…intense.
[Message 25] Kai: Guys, let's not start rumors. Someone died, remember?
[Message 26] Alex: True, true. Sorry.
[Message 27] River: Right. Sorry.
[Message 28] Kai: So, nobody knows who the victim was yet?
[Message 29] Alex: Nope. Just that it was one person.
[Message 30] River: Maybe they'll release more info tomorrow.
[Message 31] Kai: Let’s hope so. I need to know.
[Message 32] Alex: Okay, so new cafe tomorrow? Anyone?
[Message 33] River: Maybe. Depends on the news.
[Message 34] Kai: Yeah, same here.
[Message 35] Alex: Fine, party poopers.
[Message 36] River: Did either of you see anything weird at all in the last few days?
[Message 37] Kai: Nope. Just the usual. Work, home, repeat.
[Message 38] Alex: Same. Nothing out of the ordinary.
[Message 39] River: I did see Finn arguing with someone on the phone really loudly outside the coffee shop.
[Message 40] Kai: Finn? About what?
[Message 41] Alex: Finn always arguing with someone. Probably just their landlord.
[Message 42] River: It sounded more serious than that. He kept saying, ""You're going to regret this.""
[Message 43] Kai: “You’re going to regret this?” Whoa.
[Message 44] Alex: Okay, that is a little sus.
[Message 45] River: Right? That’s why I’m mentioning it.
[Message 46] Kai: Maybe we should tell the cops?
[Message 47] Alex: Whoa there, Kai. Let’s not jump to conclusions.
[Message 48] River: Yeah, maybe wait and see if it's relevant?
[Message 49] Kai: Okay, okay. Just thinking out loud.
[Message 50] Alex: So, back to the cafe tomorrow…?
[Message 51] River: I'm going to check the news before deciding.
[Message 52] Kai: Me too. Seriously disturbed by all this.
[Message 53] Alex: Whatever. I'm gonna watch a movie. Peace out.
[Message 54] River: Later.
[Message 55] Kai: Bye.
[Message 56] River: Hey, anyone hear anything else?
[Message 57] Kai: Nothing yet. Still waiting for the news to update.
[Message 58] Alex: Just saw something. They identified the victim. It was Jamison.
[Message 59] River: NO WAY! Jamison?! I can't believe it.
[Message 60] Kai: Oh my god. I was just talking to them yesterday.
[Message 61] Alex: Yeah, pretty messed up.
[Message 62] River: This is so sad. What a waste.
[Message 63] Kai: Did they say anything about a suspect?
[Message 64] Alex: Not yet. Still investigating, they said.
[Message 65] River: I can’t stop thinking about Finn saying, “You’re going to regret this.”
[Message 66] Kai: River, you really think Finn had something to do with this?
[Message 67] Alex: It’s a bit of a leap, isn’t it?
[Message 68] River: Maybe. But the timing is…suspicious.
[Message 69] Kai: I agree it's not good.
[Message 70] Alex: Let's not go pointing fingers without proof.
[Message 71] River: I just hope they find the person who did this. Jamison didn't deserve this.
[Message 72] Kai: Absolutely. Justice needs to be served.
[Message 73] Alex: Agreed. In other news, my cat just threw up on my rug.
[Message 74] River: Oh great, something else to clean up.
[Message 75] Kai: Sorry to hear that, Alex.
[Message 76] Alex: It's fine. Just adds to the general awfulness of the day.
[Message 77] River: I'm going to call the police and tell them about Finn’s comment. Even if it’s nothing, it’s worth mentioning.
[Message 78] Kai: Good idea, River.
[Message 79] Alex: Alright, you do you. I'm cleaning up cat vomit.
[Message 80] River: Talk later.
[Message 81] Kai: Later.
[Message 82] Kai: Hey, River, did you call the police?
[Message 83] River: Yeah, I did. They said they'd look into it.
[Message 84] Alex: Anything else new about Jamison?
[Message 85] Kai: Nothing I've seen. Still just the basic news reports.
[Message 86] River: I saw Sasha at the gas station. She was buying a map of Tacoma! I thought that was weird
[Message 87] Kai: A map? Maybe she's planning a road trip?
[Message 88] Alex: Seriously, you guys are seeing conspiracies everywhere.
[Message 89] River: I don’t know, Alex. It just feels like something’s off. She wanted to get rid of them.
[Message 90] Kai: Whoa, River, easy there.
[Message 91] Alex: Agreed. Lay off the accusations.
[Message 92] River: You guys are right. I'm just…upset.
[Message 93] Kai: We all are.
[Message 94] Alex: Totally.
[Message 95] River: I just...I knew Jamison. And Sasha always hated Jamison.
[Message 96] Kai: Okay, but that doesn’t mean she’s responsible.
[Message 97] Alex: Exactly. Lots of people didn’t like Jamison.
[Message 98] River: True. I'm just grasping at straws, I guess.
[Message 99] Kai: We all are.
[Message 100] Alex: Look, whoever did this is going away for a long time. Let the police do their job.
[Message 101] River: You're right.
[Message 102] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 103] Alex: So, anyone feel like ordering pizza? Comfort food time.
[Message 104] River: Sure, pizza sounds good.
[Message 105] Kai: Yeah, I'm in.
[Message 106] Alex: Great! What kind?
[Message 107] River: Pepperoni for me.
[Message 108] Kai: Me too.
[Message 109] Alex: You guys are so boring. I'm getting pineapple on half.
[Message 110] River: Ugh, pineapple on pizza? Disgusting.
[Message 111] Kai: Hard pass on the pineapple.
[Message 112] Alex: More for me then!
[Message 113] River: So, has anyone spoken to Finn or Sasha since…you know?
[Message 114] Kai: Nope. Haven't heard from either of them.
[Message 115] Alex: Me neither.
[Message 116] River: Maybe they’re avoiding us?
[Message 117] Kai: Could be. Or they’re just dealing with it in their own way.
[Message 118] Alex: Yeah, people grieve differently.
[Message 119] River: True.
[Message 120] Kai: This whole thing is just so…unreal.
[Message 121] Alex: Tell me about it.
[Message 122] River: I keep expecting Jamison to text me about some corrections they did.
[Message 123] Kai: I know, right? It’s going to take a while to process this.
[Message 124] Alex: Definitely.
[Message 125] River: I think I'm going to take a break from social media for a while. It's just too much.
[Message 126] Kai: Good idea. I might do the same.
[Message 127] Alex: I'm just going to keep watching cat videos and eating pizza.
[Message 128] River: Sounds like a plan.
[Message 129] Kai: Yep.
[Message 130] Alex: I saw Finn leave the building at Mid-Morning. I didn’t think anything of it.
[Message 131] River: Mid-Morning is when the explosion happened.
[Message 132] Kai: What building?
[Message 133] Alex: That office building on Elm. You know, the one near Skate Park.
[Message 134] River: You should tell the police that, Alex.

[Message 4] Liam: ""Yeah, poor thing. Brutal stuff.""
[Message 5] Chloe: ""OMG, I can't believe it. 1.  Law Enforcement Officer? So awful!""
[Message 6] Maya: ""Chloe, you know her?""
[Message 7] Chloe: ""Not really, but I saw her at Joe's Diner a few times. Seemed…intense.""
[Message 8] Liam: ""Intense how?""
[Message 9] Chloe: ""Like, always arguing on the phone. Business probably.""
[Message 10] Maya: ""Maybe that’s connected?""
[Message 11] Liam: ""Anything's possible. The news said Electrocution, right? That’s…specific.""
[Message 12] Chloe: ""Super weird. Who even has access to that?""
[Message 13] Ben: ""Hey guys, sorry I'm late to the chat. What's up?""
[Message 14] Maya: ""Ben, 1.  Law Enforcement Officer was murdered.""
[Message 15] Ben: ""WHAT?! Seriously? That's insane! I just saw her yesterday.""
[Message 16] Liam: ""Where, Ben?""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Outside Temple. We just nodded to each other. Nothing special.""
[Message 18] Chloe: ""Ben, were you anywhere near Temple at dawn?""
[Message 19] Ben: ""No way! I was asleep. I work nights, remember?""
[Message 20] Maya: ""Right, sorry. Just…spooked.""
[Message 21] Liam: ""So, anyone know anything about 1.  Law Enforcement Officer that might help?""
[Message 22] Chloe: ""Heard rumors she was involved in some shady stuff. Drug busts maybe?""
[Message 23] Ben: ""Yeah, I heard that too. Whispers around town.""
[Message 24] Maya: ""Shady stuff could mean enemies. Lots of them.""
[Message 25] Liam: ""True. Okay, let's try to stay calm and think logically.""
[Message 26] Chloe: ""Easier said than done. I keep thinking about how scared she must have been. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 27] Ben: ""Yeah, it's messed up.""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Has anyone talked to Amelia? She works near Temple.""
[Message 29] Liam: ""Good idea. Let me text her.""
[Message 30] Liam: ""She said she didn't see anything unusual. Just got to work at 8 am.""
[Message 31] Chloe: ""Damn. So, nobody saw anything?""
[Message 32] Ben: ""I saw Karen buying something weird at the hardware store yesterday. Looked like Electrocution supplies.""
[Message 33] Maya: ""Karen? Seriously? Why would she need that?""
[Message 34] Liam: ""Maybe she was fixing something? Let’s not jump to conclusions, Ben. That sounds really bad.""
[Message 35] Ben: ""Just saying what I saw. She looked really stressed too. Always hated 1.  Law Enforcement Officer. They had beef.""
[Message 36] Chloe: ""Beef? What kind of beef?""
[Message 37] Ben: ""Karen said 1.  Law Enforcement Officer cost her a promotion a few months ago.""
[Message 38] Maya: ""Okay, that's motive. But still…""
[Message 39] Liam: ""Let's not spread rumors. This is serious. She will get punished.""
[Message 40] Chloe: ""True. What about Jason? He's always broke. Maybe he tried to rob 1.  Law Enforcement Officer?""
[Message 41] Maya: ""Jason? He's a sweetheart, though. I can't imagine it. He was talking about hurting her right before he went over there""
[Message 42] Liam: ""Broke doesn't equal murderer. He always looks for an opportunity.""
[Message 43] Ben: ""He *was* complaining about needing money yesterday. Said he was desperate.""
[Message 44] Chloe: ""Desperate enough to Electrocution someone? Ugh.""
[Message 45] Maya: ""This is getting us nowhere. We're just guessing.""
[Message 46] Liam: ""True. Let’s focus on facts. Electrocution is unusual. Someone knew what they were doing.""
[Message 47] Chloe: ""Maybe someone wanted to get rid of 1.  Law Enforcement Officer because of something she knew.""
[Message 48] Ben: ""Like what? Drugs? Corruption?""
[Message 49] Maya: ""Could be anything. This is Detroit. The city can be dark sometimes.""
[Message 50] Liam: ""Okay, new plan. Let's all think about who might have benefited from 1.  Law Enforcement Officer's death.""
[Message 51] Chloe: ""Good call.""
[Message 52] Ben: ""I'm drawing a blank.""
[Message 53] Maya: ""Me too. Except maybe Karen…""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Guys, stop focusing on Karen. It's not helping.""
[Message 55] Chloe: ""Fine. What about the fact that she was buying Electrocution at the store?""
[Message 56] Ben: ""Maybe it was an impulsive act of rage.""
[Message 57] Maya: ""Maybe someone paid someone else to do it.""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Okay, getting too conspiracy-theory. Keep it grounded.""
[Message 59] Chloe: ""Sorry, just thinking out loud.""
[Message 60] Ben: ""So, we wait for the cops to figure it out?""
[Message 61] Maya: ""Pretty much. Unless someone knows something they're not telling us.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""Nobody should be hiding anything. This is about justice for 1.  Law Enforcement Officer.""
[Message 63] Chloe: ""Agreed. It's scary to think someone we know could be involved.""
[Message 64] Ben: ""Yeah, super messed up.""
[Message 65] Maya: ""I need a drink. This is giving me a headache.""
[Message 66] Liam: ""Me too. Maybe we should all meet up later? Talk this through in person?""

[Message 80] Maya: ""What about him?""
[Message 81] Liam: ""He seemed a little too eager to point the finger at Karen, don't you think?""
[Message 82] Maya: ""Hmm, maybe. He is not very trustworthy""
[Message 83] Liam: ""Plus, him being at Temple yesterday…and knowing about the Electrocution supplies…""
[Message 84] Maya: ""Okay, you're making me nervous.""

[Message 88] Chloe: ""Hey Liam, you still up?""
[Message 89] Liam: ""Yeah, just thinking. What's up?""
[Message 90] Chloe: ""I looked up Karen's alibi. She was at home all night. Watched movies with her husband.""
[Message 91] Liam: ""So Ben was lying?""
[Message 92] Chloe: ""Seems that way. Why would he do that?""
[Message 93] Liam: ""That's what I'm trying to figure out. See you at The Rusty Mug?""
[Message 94] Chloe: ""Yeah. Something is very wrong. He said he wanted to get rid of him.""

[Message 2] Ben: Yeah, it’s all over the news. Something about two journalists?

[Message 4] Maya: I know, right? I was just there yesterday getting coffee.
[Message 5] Ben: Wild. You were lucky.
[Message 6] Chloe: Did they say who it was?
[Message 7] Maya: Something about David and Mark.
[Message 8] Ben: David? The one who worked at the Atlanta Sun?
[Message 9] Maya: Yeah, that’s him. And Mark, I think he was a freelancer.
[Message 10] Chloe: I met Mark once at a conference. Seemed really quiet.
[Message 11] Ben: David was always kind of cynical, from what I heard.
[Message 12] Maya: I heard that too. Anyway, I'm thinking of visiting a relative out of town.
[Message 13] Ben: Good idea. You were lucky. It would be hard to cope if I were that close.
[Message 14] Chloe: That's random. But smart, Maya.
[Message 15] Maya: So, anyway, anyone know anything else about what happened?
[Message 16] Ben: Just what they're saying on TV. Drowning in a bathtub. Gruesome.
[Message 17] Chloe: Seriously awful.
[Message 18] Maya: Yeah, that’s messed up.
[Message 19] Ben: Hey, Chloe, weren’t you supposed to meet David last week for coffee?
[Message 20] Chloe: Uh, yeah, but he cancelled last minute. Said he was busy.
[Message 21] Maya: Oh really?
[Message 22] Chloe: Yeah, why?
[Message 23] Ben: No reason, just curious.
[Message 24] Chloe: Creep. Just kidding.
[Message 25] Maya: Speaking of coffee, anyone want to grab some later?
[Message 26] Ben: I’m in. Need to get out of the house.
[Message 27] Chloe: Can't. I'm helping my grandma with some stuff.
[Message 28] Maya: Okay, another time then.
[Message 29] Ben: Sounds good.
[Message 30] Chloe: I keep thinking about their families. Just terrible.
[Message 31] Maya: Yeah, definitely.
[Message 32] Ben: So, you guys think they'll catch who did it?
[Message 33] Chloe: They have to. Atlanta PD isn't exactly incompetent.
[Message 34] Maya: Hope they catch them soon. Makes me nervous.
[Message 35] Ben: Agreed. Anyway, gotta run. See you later, Maya.

[Message 39] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) How so?
[Message 40] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) I don’t know, just seems a little…off. Asking a lot of questions.
[Message 41] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Maybe she’s just shocked, like the rest of us.
[Message 42] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Maybe. But she was supposed to meet with David...and he died Mid-Morning.
[Message 43] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Okay, that IS kinda weird. But let’s not jump to conclusions.
[Message 44] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) True. I'm still going out of town just in case.
[Message 45] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Yeah, you're right. Gotta be careful.
[Message 46] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Hey Ben, you free to chat?
[Message 47] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Uh, yeah, what’s up?
[Message 48] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Did you know that Mark was working on a big story about corruption in the city?
[Message 49] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) No way, really? That could be it.
[Message 50] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) I heard someone saying he was getting close to uncovering something big. Intended to publish soon.
[Message 51] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) That’s insane. Maybe that's why Maya is acting random.
[Message 52] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) I think it makes sense for sure. You should call your relative before anything happens to you!
[Message 53] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Yeah, thanks for the heads up, Chloe.
[Message 54] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Of course. Be safe.
[Message 55] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Hey, I wanted to ask you something about David.
[Message 56] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Sure, what's up?
[Message 57] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Did he ever mention anything about… I don’t know… being afraid of anyone?
[Message 58] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) No, never. He was pretty private, though. Why?
[Message 59] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Just wondering. It’s all so strange.
[Message 60] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Tell me about it.
[Message 61] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Well, gotta go. Later!

[Message 68] Maya: Oh my god. I need to go.
[Message 69] Ben: Be careful!
[Message 70] Chloe: Keep us updated!
[Message 71] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) See? I told you she was acting weird!
[Message 72] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Yeah, maybe you’re right. But why would she do it?
[Message 73] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) I don’t know, maybe David found out something about her?
[Message 74] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Like what?
[Message 75] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) I don’t know! Maybe she owed him money? Maybe he was gonna expose something about her past?
[Message 76] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Anything is possible at this point. I'm at my relative's house now. I'll keep you posted.
[Message 77] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Stay safe!
[Message 78] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Hey, can you talk?
[Message 79] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Yeah, what’s going on? You okay?
[Message 80] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) The police were here because someone reported a suspicious package outside my door. It was nothing.
[Message 81] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Wow, that’s crazy. Are you sure it was nothing?
[Message 82] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Yeah, they checked it out. Just some kind of mix up.
[Message 83] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Who would do that to you?
[Message 84] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) I have no idea! Probably just some random prank.
[Message 85] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
[Message 86] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) I'm leaving town to visit my grandmother.
[Message 87] Ben: (Private Message to Maya) Good idea. Stay safe!
[Message 88] Maya: (Private Message to Ben) Thanks, you too.
[Message 89] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Everything okay? Ben said the cops were at your place.
[Message 90] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Yeah, it was nothing. Just a false alarm.
[Message 91] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Still, scary!
[Message 92] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) I know, right?
[Message 93] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) I hope they catch whoever did this to David and Mark soon. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 94] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Me too. It's awful.
[Message 95] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) Okay, well, let me know if you need anything!
[Message 96] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Thanks, Chloe. I appreciate it.
[Message 97] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) You haven't heard from Maya, have you?
[Message 98] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) She said it was a false alarm at her place. Why?
[Message 99] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Just checking. Things aren't adding up.
[Message 100] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Yeah, tell me about it.
[Message 101] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Did David have enemies?
[Message 102] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) You know, I think he might have fired someone recently. A trans man I think.
[Message 103] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Interesting....Very interesting.
[Message 104] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Let me know if you need anything.
[Message 105] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Thanks, Chloe.

[Message 114] Chloe: Exactly.
[Message 115] Maya: Okay, will do.
[Message 116] Ben: Did either of you know David well?
[Message 117] Chloe: Not really. Just met him that one time.
[Message 118] Maya: I knew him a little better. We worked on a project together once.
[Message 119] Ben: What was he like?
[Message 120] Maya: He was okay, pretty intense about his work. Why?
[Message 121] Ben: Just trying to piece things together.
[Message 122] Chloe: Me too. It's like a puzzle with missing pieces.
[Message 123] Maya: Totally.
[Message 124] Ben: So, nothing seemed off about him? No one threatening him or anything?
[Message 125] Maya: Not that I know of. He was always complaining about deadlines, though.
[Message 126] Chloe: Deadlines are a killer.
[Message 127] Maya: For real. Anyway, gotta go. Grandma needs help with something.
[Message 128] Ben: Okay, talk later.
[Message 129] Chloe: Bye!
[Message 130] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) I just remembered something. Maya was looking up how to make Drowning in a bathtub online a few weeks ago. She said it was for a story she was writing.
[Message 131] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) No way! That's insane!
[Message 132] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) I know, right?
[Message 133] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) We need to tell the police!
[Message 134] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) I don't know...what if we're wrong?
[Message 135] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) We can't take that chance! These were his actions around the time of the crime!
[Message 136] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) Okay, okay. You're right. I'll call them.
[Message 137] Chloe: (Private Message to Ben) Be careful, Ben!
[Message 138] Ben: (Private Message to Chloe) You too, Chloe.
[Message 139] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Hey, could you do me a huge favor?
[Message 140] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) What is it?
[Message 141] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Could you delete our message history? Just… everything.
[Message 142] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) What? Why would I do that?
[Message 143] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) It's just… I don't want the police digging through my personal stuff. Please?
[Message 144] Chloe: (Private Message to Maya) I don't know, Maya…
[Message 145] Maya: (Private Message to Chloe) Please, Chloe! It would really help me out!

[Message 25] Ben: ""Sandwich method: positive, negative, positive. Works every time.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""That's a good strategy, Ben. Also, be specific about what needs improvement.""
[Message 27] Jordan: ""And frame it as areas for growth, Leo, not just pointing out flaws.""
[Message 28] Leo: ""Good point, Jordan. I tend to be pretty blunt.""
[Message 29] Ben: ""We know, Leo! That's part of your charm.""
[Message 30] Alex: ""Haha, true. But a little sugarcoating never hurts.""
[Message 31] Jordan: ""Maybe think about what his strengths are and how he can leverage them to improve in other areas.""
[Message 32] Leo: ""Okay, so highlight strengths, offer specific suggestions, and frame it positively. Got it.""
[Message 33] Ben: ""Exactly! You'll do great, Leo.""
[Message 34] Alex: ""On a completely different note, did anyone see that documentary about bees last night?""
[Message 35] Jordan: ""No, I missed it. Was it good?""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Super interesting! Made me want to start beekeeping.""
[Message 37] Ben: ""Beekeeping? Now that's a hobby I haven't heard before.""
[Message 38] Leo: ""Yeah, Alex, that sounds… adventurous.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""It's important! They're vital to our ecosystem.""
[Message 40] Jordan: ""True! Plus, you'd have your own honey!""
[Message 41] Ben: ""Okay, now you're selling it, Jordan.""
[Message 42] Leo: ""Back to the electrician, I was also thinking of investing in some new tools. Any recommendations there?""
[Message 43] Ben: ""Sorry, Leo, that's outside my area of expertise.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""Same here. Maybe ask someone at the hardware store?""
[Message 45] Jordan: ""Yeah, or check out some online electrician forums. They probably have recommendations.""
[Message 46] Leo: ""Good idea, Jordan. Will do.""
[Message 47] Ben: ""So, Alex, seriously considering beekeeping? Where would you even put the hives?""
[Message 48] Alex: ""I have a decent sized balcony. I'd need to research local regulations, of course.""
[Message 49] Jordan: ""Wow, that's dedication!""
[Message 50] Leo: ""Okay, back to future plans...seriously this time. I think I might try volunteering at the local animal shelter.""
[Message 51] Ben: ""That's really nice, Leo.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""That's wonderful, Leo! They always need help.""
[Message 53] Jordan: ""Definitely a worthy cause, Leo.""
[Message 54] Ben: ""Speaking of volunteering, I might try to do more with Habitat for Humanity next year.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""That's awesome, Ben! Building houses is incredibly rewarding.""
[Message 56] Jordan: ""I've always admired the work they do.""
[Message 57] Leo: ""Alright, well, I think that covers most of my future plans. Anyone else got anything they want to share?""
[Message 58] Ben: ""I'm good. Just gotta finish this project!""

[Message 2] Lou: Hey Brenda! I am! Just trying to figure out the best countertop. So many choices!
[Message 3] Brenda: Oh man, I know the feeling. I got totally overwhelmed when I did my bathroom. Have you looked at granite?
[Message 4] Lou: Granite is definitely on the list. But I'm also considering quartz. Heard it's more durable.
[Message 5] Brenda: Quartz is good! Less maintenance, for sure. Speaking of maintenance, are you going to Pam's wedding reception next weekend?
[Message 6] Lou: Pam's wedding? Oh, that's right! I almost forgot. I think so, if I can get the plumbing sorted by then.
[Message 7] Brenda: Haha, plumbing always dictates everything, doesn't it? What kind of vibe are you going for in the kitchen, style-wise?
[Message 8] Lou: I'm thinking modern farmhouse. Lots of light, maybe some open shelving. What about you, any new volunteering opportunities lately?
[Message 9] Brenda: Always! The soup kitchen is always looking for help. Farmhouse, huh? Nice! I always lean towards brighter colors myself.
[Message 10] Lou: Bright colors are fun! But I'm trying to keep it relatively neutral so it doesn't clash with everything else in the house.
[Message 11] Brenda: Makes sense. I impulse-painted my living room bright yellow once. Regretted it for years.
[Message 12] Lou: Haha! I can imagine. So, quartz or granite... Any strong opinions?
[Message 13] Brenda: Honestly, go with what *you* like best! But if durability is a major concern, quartz might be the winner.
[Message 14] Lou: Good point. And what about appliances? Are you upgrading those too?
[Message 15] Brenda: I did a few years back. Stainless steel all the way. Easy to clean.
[Message 16] Lou: Stainless is classic. Thinking of maybe a black stainless. A little more edgy.
[Message 17] Brenda: Ooh, fancy! That sounds cool. Hey, did you ever read that book I lent you, ""The Martian""?
[Message 18] Lou: ""The Martian""? Yes! Great book. Really enjoyed it. Thanks for lending it!
[Message 19] Brenda: No problem! Glad you liked it. Back to the kitchen... What about the backsplash?
[Message 20] Lou: Backsplash... still undecided. Maybe subway tile? Classic and clean.
[Message 21] Brenda: Subway tile is always a good choice. Can't go wrong. I'm thinking of planting some new roses in the spring.
[Message 22] Lou: Roses are beautiful! Hard to keep them alive though. What color are you thinking?
[Message 23] Brenda: Probably a deep red. I love a good, dramatic rose. Okay, gotta run! Good luck with the kitchen!
[Message 24] Lou: Thanks, Brenda! I appreciate the advice. Talk to you soon. Maybe see you at the wedding reception?
[Message 25] Brenda: Definitely! See ya then, Lou!",0,

[Message 9] Alex: ""Apparently, they're considering adding more bike lanes downtown.""
[Message 10] Jamie: ""Oh, that's interesting. Would be great for getting around.""
[Message 11] River: ""That could be useful. Parking downtown is a nightmare.""
[Message 12] Alex: ""Exactly! I saw a proposal online; looks pretty comprehensive.""
[Message 13] Jamie: ""Link it if you have it handy?""
[Message 14] Alex: ""Will do, after coffee. Anything else happening?""
[Message 15] River: ""Heard they're finally redoing that section of Bardstown Road.""
[Message 16] Jamie: ""About time! That's been a mess for ages.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Yeah, that should help with traffic flow.""
[Message 18] River: ""Speaking of traffic, anyone know what's up with the meeting today?""
[Message 19] Jamie: ""You mean the project team meeting? I think it's about the Q3 report.""
[Message 20] Alex: ""Q3 already? Time flies.""
[Message 21] River: ""Tell me about it. I'm prepping my part now.""
[Message 22] Jamie: ""Good luck with that! I'm presenting the marketing overview.""

[Message 24] River: ""Definitely! You always kill it.""
[Message 25] Jamie: ""Thanks, you two! I appreciate that.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""So, back to the news... I also saw something about the new Waterfront Park expansion.""
[Message 27] River: ""Oh yeah? What's the scoop?""
[Message 28] Alex: ""More green space, apparently. And a new concert venue.""
[Message 29] Jamie: ""That sounds amazing! More outdoor concerts would be awesome.""
[Message 30] River: ""I'm in! More space for activities is always a good thing.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Agreed! Although, I do wonder about the noise level for those living nearby.""
[Message 32] Jamie: ""Good point, Alex. Hopefully, they'll address that.""
[Message 33] River: ""Maybe they'll have noise ordinances or something.""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Let's hope so. Did you guys see that Cardinals game last night?""
[Message 35] Jamie: ""I didn't, but I heard they won!""
[Message 36] River: ""Yeah! They totally crushed it. Best game I've seen in ages.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Good for them! Sports aren't really my thing, though.""
[Message 38] Jamie: ""That's okay! Everyone has their own interests.""
[Message 39] River: ""True! More celebrating for me, then!""
[Message 40] Alex: ""Ha! Sounds like a plan. Coffee's great, River, thanks!""
[Message 41] Jamie: ""It is! Perfect for this morning chill.""
[Message 42] River: ""Glad you both like it! Just made a fresh pot.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Speaking of chill, anyone thinking about a hike later?""
[Message 44] Jamie: ""That sounds lovely, Alex. I'm in!""
[Message 45] River: ""I'd be up for that after the team meeting.""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Perfect! We can decide on a trail later.""
[Message 47] Jamie: ""Sounds like a plan. Maybe something near the creek?""
[Message 48] River: ""That sounds nice and relaxing.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""I'm good with that. I saw some wildflowers blooming there last week.""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""Oh, I love wildflowers! I'll bring my camera.""
[Message 51] River: ""Awesome! I'll pack some snacks.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Teamwork makes the dream work! Back to the news, though…""
[Message 53] Jamie: ""Always more to discuss!""
[Message 54] River: ""Yep! Never a dull moment in Louisville.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""I heard the Speed Art Museum is having a new exhibit next month.""
[Message 56] Jamie: ""Oh, really? What's it about?""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Something about contemporary sculpture, I think.""
[Message 58] River: ""Might be interesting to check out sometime.""
[Message 59] Jamie: ""Definitely. I always enjoy the Speed.""
[Message 60] Alex: ""Me too. It's a great place to spend an afternoon.""
[Message 61] River: ""Agreed! Especially on a rainy day.""
[Message 62] Jamie: ""True! Speaking of rain, the weather forecast looks clear for our hike, thankfully.""
[Message 63] Alex: ""That's good news! I was a little worried.""
[Message 64] River: ""Me too. Hiking in the rain isn't my favorite.""
[Message 65] Jamie: ""No, thank you! I prefer sunshine.""
[Message 66] Alex: ""Hear, hear! So, anything else interesting happening in your worlds?""
[Message 67] River: ""Just been busy showing houses all week. The market is still crazy.""
[Message 68] Jamie: ""Wow, that's intense. Hope you're getting some good deals.""
[Message 69] River: ""Fingers crossed! It's definitely a hustle.""
[Message 70] Alex: ""I can imagine. Real estate is always a rollercoaster.""
[Message 71] Jamie: ""Tell me about it. I'm glad I'm sticking to project management.""
[Message 72] Alex: ""Safer bet, perhaps. I'm just crunching numbers, as usual.""
[Message 73] River: ""Someone's gotta do it!""
[Message 74] Jamie: ""Exactly! We all play our part.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""True that. I should probably start thinking about packing up.""
[Message 76] River: ""Already? Seems like we just got here.""
[Message 77] Jamie: ""I know, right? Time flies when you're having fun.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""It does. But I have some errands to run this afternoon.""

[Message 88] River: ""Definitely! The more, the merrier.""
[Message 89] Jamie: ""Perfect! I'll bring the sides.""

[Message 91] Jamie: ""It is. Thanks again for making it!""
[Message 92] River: ""No problem! Always happy to share.""
[Message 93] Jamie: ""I should probably check my work emails quickly before the meeting.""
[Message 94] River: ""Good idea. I should do the same.""
[Message 95] Jamie: ""Just making sure nothing urgent has come up.""
[Message 96] River: ""Yep! Always a good precaution.""
[Message 97] Jamie: ""Okay, all clear on my end. Just some routine updates.""
[Message 98] River: ""Same here. Nothing major.""
[Message 99] Jamie: ""Great! Then we can relax and enjoy the rest of the morning.""

[Message 5] Daniel: ""I heard one of them was that activist, Alex.""
[Message 6] Liam: ""Alex? Wow, really? I saw Alex buying Pushing from a height stuff there just last week, for some project or something.""
[Message 7] Maya: ""Oh no, that's terrible. I knew Alex. Always so full of energy.""
[Message 8] Noah: ""And the other one? Anyone know?""

[Message 22] Maya: ""I can't imagine anyone hating Alex. So carefree.""
[Message 23] Noah: ""You never know, Maya. Activists ruffle feathers. Maybe someone didn't like their methods. She was always shouting about something.""
[Message 24] Olivia: ""True. And Sarah... I heard she had recently fired someone for stealing.""
[Message 25] Daniel: ""Wow, seriously? Who was it?""
[Message 26] Liam: ""I remember Sarah saying she wanted to get rid of him. Someone must have been really angry, though. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 27] Maya: ""Yeah, firing someone is never easy. But murder? That's extreme.""
[Message 28] Noah: ""Financial gain is a powerful motivator. Maybe the fired employee was desperate. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened. Or maybe it was an accident?""
[Message 29] Olivia: ""I heard that Sarah had a large insurance policy. Maybe the husband did it?""
[Message 30] Daniel: ""Whoa, Olivia, that's a pretty serious accusation!""
[Message 31] Liam: ""Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. Let's let the police do their job.""
[Message 32] Maya: ""Good point, Liam. But it's hard not to speculate when something this awful happens.""

[Message 34] Olivia: ""I heard it was around Sunset.""
[Message 35] Daniel: ""Sunset? That's so early! It was still light out, right?""
[Message 36] Liam: ""Yeah, barely dark. Makes you wonder how someone could get away with it.""
[Message 37] Maya: ""Maybe it wasn't planned? Maybe it was just a heated argument that got out of control?""
[Message 38] Noah: ""Possible. People do crazy things in the heat of the moment.""

[Message 17] Maya: ""Sounds good. See you guys at Java Joe's in an hour.""
[Message 18] Ben: ""Sorry I was out so late. Woke up with a killer headache.""
[Message 19] Chloe: ""Dude, where were you? We were worried.""
[Message 20] Ben: ""Just downtown. Nothing exciting. Why, what's up?""
[Message 21] Liam: ""Seriously, Ben? Two people were murdered.""
[Message 22] Ben: ""What?! Where?""
[Message 23] Kai: ""Tunnel. Evening.""
[Message 24] Ben: ""Oh my god. That's terrible.""
[Message 25] Maya: ""Yeah. You okay, Ben? You seem a little off.""
[Message 26] Ben: ""Just tired. Long night.""
[Message 27] Chloe: ""Did you see anything strange downtown?""
[Message 28] Ben: ""Uh, no. Just the usual stuff. Crowds, traffic...""
[Message 29] Liam: ""He's probably covering up another crime. Just kidding.... unless?""
[Message 30] Kai: ""Okay, that's not funny, Liam.""
[Message 31] Maya: ""Seriously, cut it out. This is too soon.""
[Message 32] Ben: ""Guys, I swear, I didn't see anything. I was just at the bar.""
[Message 33] Chloe: ""Which bar?""
[Message 34] Ben: ""The one near the docks. Can't remember the name. I had a few too many.""
[Message 35] Liam: ""Right. Okay. Well, just checking.""
[Message 36] Kai: ""Anyone hear what they are thinking of doing to the killer?""
[Message 37] Maya: ""I heard they're looking at security footage from the tunnel.""
[Message 38] Ben: ""Good. They should catch the guy.""
[Message 39] Chloe: ""I hope so. Sarah didn't deserve that.""
[Message 40] Liam: ""I heard Alex was kind of a pain in the ass, though.""
[Message 41] Maya: ""Liam! That's awful.""
[Message 42] Kai: ""Yeah, seriously insensitive.""
[Message 43] Liam: ""Sorry, sorry. Just saying what I heard. He was always protesting something.""
[Message 44] Ben: ""Doesn't mean he deserved to die.""
[Message 45] Chloe: ""Exactly. We all have the right to protest.""
[Message 46] Maya: ""Anyone know anything about Electrocution?""
[Message 47] Kai: ""Why do you ask?""
[Message 48] Maya: ""Just curious. I heard that's how they were killed.""
[Message 49] Ben: ""That's gruesome.""
[Message 50] Liam: ""Yeah, sounds like something out of a horror movie.""
[Message 51] Chloe: ""Makes me sick.""
[Message 52] Maya: ""I'm gonna go get some air. This is stressing me out.""
[Message 53] Kai: ""Okay, see you later.""
[Message 54] Liam: ""Stay safe.""
[Message 55] Ben: ""Yeah, be careful.""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""So, Liam, why did you say Alex was a 'pain in the ass'?""
[Message 57] Liam: ""Just heard it from a friend. He caused some trouble at a company event once.""
[Message 58] Chloe: ""That's still no reason to say that after what happened.""
[Message 59] Liam: ""I know, I know. I apologized.""
[Message 60] Ben: ""Guys, can we just drop it? This is making me uncomfortable.""
[Message 61] Kai: ""Agreed. Let's talk about something else.""
[Message 62] Chloe: ""Fine. What's everyone doing this weekend?""
[Message 63] Liam: ""Thinking of going to the beach. Need some sun.""
[Message 64] Ben: ""I might just stay in and relax.""
[Message 65] Kai: ""I'm working.""
[Message 66] Chloe: ""Boring. We should all do something together.""
[Message 67] Liam: ""Like what? Go to Tunnel?""
[Message 68] Ben: ""Don't even joke about that.""
[Message 69] Kai: ""How about that new escape room?""
[Message 70] Chloe: ""That could be fun.""
[Message 71] Liam: ""Okay, I'm in.""
[Message 72] Ben: ""Maybe. I'll let you know.""
[Message 73] Chloe: ""Okay, but seriously, Ben, you seem really off. Are you sure you're okay?""
[Message 74] Ben: ""I'm fine, Chloe. Just a lot to process.""
[Message 75] Liam: ""He was looking up how to make Electrocution online. Just kidding, of course.""
[Message 76] Kai: ""Liam, knock it off!""
[Message 77] Chloe: ""He didn't seem to like Alex.""
[Message 78] Ben: ""What are you talking about?""
[Message 79] Chloe: ""I'm just saying, he was being kind of provocative.""
[Message 80] Maya: ""Hey, back. Feeling a little better. Anything new?""
[Message 81] Kai: ""Just the usual Liam being insensitive.""
[Message 82] Maya: ""Ugh, figures.""
[Message 83] Ben: ""I'm going to go. Feeling sick.""
[Message 84] Chloe: ""Okay, feel better.""
[Message 85] Maya: ""Yeah, take care.""
[Message 86] Liam: ""See ya.""
[Message 87] Kai: ""Bye.""
[Message 88] Chloe: ""Why do I feel like Ben knows more than he's letting on?""
[Message 89] Maya: ""I don't know. He's always been a bit weird.""
[Message 90] Kai: ""I saw him leave the building at Evening that night.""
[Message 91] Chloe: ""Really? Which building?""
[Message 92] Kai: ""Near Tunnel. I thought he lived around there.""
[Message 93] Maya: ""He lives on the other side of town. You intended to imply something?""
[Message 94] Chloe: ""This is getting creepy.""
[Message 95] Liam: ""Hey, saw Ben buying Electrocution at the store today. Just kidding.""
[Message 96] Maya: ""Liam, seriously, shut up. You're not helping.""
[Message 97] Chloe: ""You said you were downtown too, right Liam?""
[Message 98] Liam: ""Yeah. Drinks with a friend.""
[Message 99] Maya: ""I am really going to call the police.""
[Message 100] Kai: ""Whoa Maya calm down. It isn't worth it.""
[Message 101] Maya: ""I knew something was fishy. Ben always hated Alex.""
[Message 102] Chloe: ""He did? I never noticed.""
[Message 103] Kai: ""Yeah, he always rolled his eyes when Alex came up in conversation.""

[Message 1] Maya: ""Did you guys hear about what happened at Fairground?""
[Message 2] Ben: ""Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. What a mess.""
[Message 3] Chloe: ""Terrible. Any idea who they were?""
[Message 4] Maya: ""I heard one was a Corrections Officer named Alex.""
[Message 5] Ben: ""Alex? Damn. I knew him. Always seemed like a tough guy.""
[Message 6] Chloe: ""I think the other one was a social worker, Chris, right?""
[Message 7] Maya: ""Yeah, Chris. Seemed like he was always trying to help people.""
[Message 8] Ben: ""So messed up. Anyone know what happened?""
[Message 9] Chloe: ""Rumor is Strangulation with a rope was involved. Saw something about it online.""
[Message 10] Maya: ""Strangulation with a rope? That's brutal.""
[Message 11] Ben: ""Someone really intended to do some damage.""
[Message 12] Chloe: ""Police are all over the place. Stay clear of Fairground for now.""
[Message 13] Maya: ""Good idea. I'm staying in. Netflix and chill.""
[Message 14] Ben: ""Same here. This whole thing is giving me the creeps.""
[Message 15] Chloe: ""Me too. I saw Justin buying rope at the hardware store yesterday. Thought it was weird.""
[Message 16] Maya: ""Justin? Why would he need Strangulation with a rope?""
[Message 17] Ben: ""Maybe he's into some weird DIY project. Don't jump to conclusions.""
[Message 18] Chloe: ""I don't know, Ben. He seemed really agitated when I saw him. Mentioned how Chris fired him last month.""
[Message 19] Maya: ""Fired him? No way. Chris never struck me as that type of person.""
[Message 20] Ben: ""People change, Maya. Besides, getting fired can make someone snap.""
[Message 21] Chloe: ""True. There was definitely no concurrence. Maybe it was justified.""
[Message 22] Maya: ""Did anyone see Jessica around yesterday?""
[Message 23] Ben: ""Jessica? Why her?""
[Message 24] Chloe: ""I heard she and Alex were having problems. Big problems.""
[Message 25] Maya: ""Really? I thought they were solid.""
[Message 26] Ben: ""I saw her leaving the Fairground area around noon. Said she was grabbing lunch.""
[Message 27] Chloe: ""Noon? That's around when it happened, right?""
[Message 28] Maya: ""Yeah. But she couldn't have… could she?""
[Message 29] Ben: ""Don't know, but she always hated Alex. Said he was stubborn and wouldn't listen to her.""
[Message 30] Chloe: ""This is getting heavy. I'm worried.""
[Message 31] Maya: ""Me too. Let's just wait and see what the police find.""
[Message 32] Ben: ""Agreed. This could affect all of us. I hope they don't get the death penalty""
[Message 33] Chloe: ""What do you mean, Ben? 'Affect all of us'?""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Just saying, it's a small town. Things like this ripple through everyone.""
[Message 35] Maya: ""Right. Totally. Just a general statement.""
[Message 36] Chloe: ""I need to pick up some milk. Anyone need anything?""
[Message 37] Ben: ""Nah, I'm good. Thanks though.""
[Message 38] Maya: ""Same here. Be safe out there, Chloe.""
[Message 39] Chloe: ""Will do. Talk soon.""
[Message 40] Ben: ""Hey Maya, you think Justin would really do something like that?""
[Message 41] Maya: ""Honestly, Ben? I don't know. He's always been a bit… off. Mental illness-induced delusion is a real thing.""
[Message 42] Ben: ""True. But Strangulation with a rope? That's a pretty deliberate act.""
[Message 43] Maya: ""Maybe he snapped. I heard Chris was really harsh when he fired him. Like, humiliating harsh.""
[Message 44] Ben: ""I guess. Still seems… extreme. What about Jessica? Any chance it was her?""
[Message 45] Maya: ""Possible. But she seems genuinely shocked by the news. Though, that could be an act.""
[Message 46] Ben: ""I saw Jessica arguing with Alex last week. Pretty heated. She said she wanted to get rid of him.""
[Message 47] Maya: ""Wow. Okay, that's definitely suspicious.""
[Message 48] Ben: ""Yeah, but she said it out of anger. Doesn't necessarily mean she'd actually do something.""
[Message 49] Maya: ""True. But I think Chris shouted at Jessica before he went to fairground""
[Message 50] Ben: ""I was thinking about how the harm came to Chris and Alex. It seems if someone called 911, maybe they would have lived, or at least had a chance""
[Message 51] Maya: ""Did you ever talk to the guy who was the 10. Social Worker?""
[Message 52] Ben: ""Yeah, I knew Chris. He was always ambitious.""
[Message 53] Maya: ""Hmm. This is all just so messed up. I can't believe Alex is gone.""
[Message 54] Ben: ""I saw some pretty bad wounds on the people at Fairground.""
[Message 55] Maya: ""Yeah. I'm pretty sure that this crime comes with a significant punishment.""
[Message 56] Chloe: ""Hey guys, police just showed up at Justin's house.""
[Message 57] Ben: ""Seriously? Guess they found something.""
[Message 58] Maya: ""Wow. Maybe he did it.""

[Message 5] Maya: I heard whispers of a golf club. Crazy.
[Message 6] Liam: A golf club? That's… intense. Who would do that?
[Message 7] Maya: That's what everyone is saying!! They're going away for a long time for this
[Message 8] Liam: So sad. I can't believe someone would hurt her so badly.
[Message 9] Maya: Me neither. Did you know Riley well?
[Message 10] Liam: Not really. Just knew her from the gallery. You?
[Message 11] Maya: Yeah, we were working on a project together. I'm supposed to meet her tomorrow.
[Message 12] Liam: Oh wow, that's gotta be rough.
[Message 13] Maya: Tell me about it. I'm so freaked out.
[Message 14] Liam: Maybe you should take some time off.
[Message 15] Maya: Maybe. Anyway, what are you up to today? Trying to distract myself.
[Message 16] Liam: Just working. Wish I could take the day off. This whole thing is making me uneasy.
[Message 17] Maya: I know, right? Anyway, let's talk about something else.
[Message 18] Liam: Agreed. Did you see that new exhibit downtown?
[Message 19] Maya: No, what's it like?
[Message 20] Liam: Some really cool sculptures, very modern.
[Message 21] Maya: Sounds interesting. Maybe we should go sometime.
[Message 22] Liam: Definitely! Let me know when you're free.
[Message 23] Maya: Will do! Hey, did you see Kai at the gallery last week?
[Message 24] Liam: I think so. They were looking at a painting, if I remember right.
[Message 25] Maya: Yeah, I saw them looking at Riley kinda intensely too. I’m just saying.
[Message 26] Liam: Really? Huh. I didn’t notice that.
[Message 27] Maya: I’m probably just overthinking it.
[Message 28] Liam: Probably. Don't let your mind run wild.
[Message 29] Kai: Hey, have either of you heard anything new about Riley?
[Message 30] Maya: Just what's on the news. Why?
[Message 31] Kai: Just… concerned. It's all so messed up. I knew Riley and wanted to know if the police found out anything.
[Message 32] Liam: Same here. Pretty shocking.
[Message 33] Maya: Yeah, the gallery feels so different now.
[Message 34] Kai: Tell me about it. I can't even think about going back there.
[Message 35] Liam: Me neither. Gives me the creeps.
[Message 36] Maya: Do you think they’ll find out who did it?
[Message 37] Kai: I hope so. Whoever did this needs to pay.
[Message 38] Liam: Agreed. What were you doing last night, Kai?
[Message 39] Kai: Just at home, watching TV. Why?
[Message 40] Liam: Just curious. Everyone's a suspect, right?
[Message 41] Kai: Seriously? You think I had something to do with it?
[Message 42] Maya: Liam! Don't be like that.
[Message 43] Liam: Sorry, sorry. Didn't mean it like that.
[Message 44] Kai: Whatever. I’m going to go do something productive.
[Message 45] Maya: Later, Kai.
[Message 46] Liam: See ya. Look, Maya, I just… I can't shake this feeling.
[Message 47] Maya: What feeling?
[Message 48] Liam: That something’s not right. Something's being hidden.
[Message 49] Maya: Well, duh. Of course something's being hidden. Someone committed a murder!
[Message 50] Liam: No, I mean… before that. Riley… she was acting weird lately.
[Message 51] Maya: Weird how?
[Message 52] Liam: On edge. Like she was expecting something bad to happen. She even started taking self-defense classes.
[Message 53] Maya: Seriously? She never mentioned anything to me.
[Message 54] Liam: Maybe she didn’t want to worry you.
[Message 55] Maya: Maybe. It just makes everything even sadder.
[Message 56] Liam: Yeah. Hey, remember that old golf club Riley kept in her office?
[Message 57] Maya: Yeah? What about it? It was so odd.
[Message 58] Liam: Just… wondering where it is now.
[Message 59] Maya: Oh god, you don’t think…?
[Message 60] Liam: I don’t know what to think anymore. I saw Kai leave the building at Midnight and that's when I went to bed.
[Message 61] Maya: That's awful. What about Alex? I saw them at the bar that night.
[Message 62] Liam: No idea. Haven’t talked to Alex.
[Message 63] Maya: Maybe we should talk to the police, Liam.
[Message 64] Liam: About what? Speculation? They’ll laugh us out of the station.
[Message 65] Maya: But what if we know something important?
[Message 66] Liam: Look, let the police do their job, okay?
[Message 67] Maya: Fine. But I still don't feel right about all this.
[Message 68] Liam: I know. Me neither.
[Message 69] Maya: I think Alex knew more than they were letting on.
[Message 70] Liam: What makes you say that?
[Message 71] Maya: The way they were talking about Riley last week. Almost like they were… jealous.
[Message 72] Liam: Jealous? Of what?
[Message 73] Maya: Her success, maybe? Or maybe Riley and Alex had a thing for each other and it didn’t work out.
[Message 74] Liam: Anything’s possible, I guess. It was an impulsive act of rage, maybe that means it wasnt planned.
[Message 75] Maya: Alex has anger issues, that's all I'm saying.
[Message 76] Liam: Okay, I hear you. But still, let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 77] Maya: I’m not, I'm just saying...
[Message 78] Liam: I know, I know. It's just… this whole thing is messed up.
[Message 79] Maya: Tell me about it. So, what are you doing for dinner?
[Message 80] Liam: Thinking about ordering pizza. Want to come over?
[Message 81] Maya: Sure, that sounds good. I need a distraction.
[Message 82] Liam: Great. Come around 7?
[Message 83] Maya: Perfect. See you then.
[Message 84] Liam: Later. Hey, one more thing.
[Message 85] Maya: Yeah?
[Message 86] Liam: Please don't mention any of this to anyone, okay? Not about Kai, not about Alex, not about the golf club.
[Message 87] Maya: Why not?
[Message 88] Liam: Just… trust me on this. It’s better if we keep it to ourselves.
[Message 89] Maya: Okay… if you say so.
[Message 90] Liam: Thanks. See you tonight.
[Message 91] Maya: See you.
[Message 92] Liam: You know, Riley always hated how much time Kai spent at the gallery.
[Message 93] Maya: Really? I never noticed.
[Message 94] Liam: Yeah. She said Kai was always lurking around, making her nervous. It was awful for Riley.
[Message 95] Maya: Wow. I had no idea. That's so sad.",1,

[Message 1] Kai: ""Did anyone see Amelia today? I tried calling but no answer.""
[Message 2] Leo: ""Nah, haven't seen her. Maybe she's just busy. You know how creative she is; maybe she's locked in her art studio.""
[Message 3] Sam: ""Yeah, Amelia probably just lost track of time. Don't worry, Kai.""
[Message 4] River: ""Speaking of creative, check out this new filter on Insta!""
[Message 5] Kai: ""It's just... she was supposed to finalize the Henderson case today. Important stuff.""
[Message 6] Leo: ""Henderson case? What's that?""
[Message 7] Sam: ""Some land dispute thing, right? I heard Amelia was the judge.""
[Message 8] River: ""Ugh, legal stuff. Boring. Anyway, who's up for pizza tonight?""
[Message 9] Kai: ""Pizza sounds good. But I'm still worried about Amelia. Something feels off.""
[Message 10] Leo: ""Chill, Kai. She's a grown woman. She can handle herself.""
[Message 11] Sam: ""Leo's right. Don't jump to conclusions. I'm in for pizza.""
[Message 12] River: ""Me too! Let's do it at 8?""
[Message 13] Kai: ""Okay, okay. Pizza at 8. I'll try Amelia again before then.""

[Message 15] Sam: ""👍""
[Message 16] River: ""👍""
[Message 17] Kai: ""Still no answer. I'm going to check her studio.""

[Message 19] Sam: ""Yeah, Kai, maybe give her some space.""
[Message 20] River: ""Drama llama. Can we please just talk about pizza toppings?""
[Message 21] Kai: ""Sorry, guys. I just...I feel responsible somehow. What if something happened because of that Henderson case?""
[Message 22] Leo: ""Responsible? That's a stretch. You weren't even involved.""
[Message 23] Sam: ""Exactly. Relax.""
[Message 24] River: ""Pineapple is a must. Don't even argue.""
[Message 25] Kai: ""Guys, I have to go. I'm going to her studio.""
[Message 26] Leo: ""Fine, but don't say we didn't warn you.""
[Message 27] Sam: ""Be careful.""
[Message 28] River: ""🙄""
[Message 29] Kai: ""Guys, I'm at the library. Something's really wrong. There's smoke.""
[Message 30] Leo: ""Smoke? What do you mean smoke?""
[Message 31] Sam: ""The library? What's Amelia doing there?""
[Message 32] River: ""The library? I was just there earlier today. I thought I saw someone buying Arson by setting a fire, but didn't think much of it.""
[Message 33] Kai: ""Fire. There's a fire at the library! I think... I think Amelia's inside.""
[Message 34] Leo: ""Call 911, Kai! Now!""
[Message 35] Sam: ""Oh my god, is she okay?""
[Message 36] River: ""This is insane. I feel like someone wanted this.""
[Message 37] Kai: ""I called 911! They're on their way! This is a nightmare.""
[Message 38] Leo: ""Keep us updated, Kai. Please.""
[Message 39] Sam: ""I can't believe this is happening.""
[Message 40] River: ""I'm so shook right now.""
[Message 41] Kai: ""The firefighters are here. They're going in.""
[Message 42] Leo: ""Any news?""
[Message 43] Sam: ""Praying for Amelia.""
[Message 44] River: ""This is like something out of a movie.""
[Message 45] Kai: ""They... they found her. It's... it's bad.""

[Message 47] Sam: ""No... no way.""
[Message 48] River: ""Oh my god, no.""
[Message 49] Kai: ""She's gone. Amelia is gone.""
[Message 50] Leo: ""I... I don't know what to say. This is awful.""
[Message 51] Sam: ""I can't believe it. I just saw her last week.""
[Message 52] River: ""Remember when she tripped over her cat and spilled coffee everywhere? She laughed so hard.""
[Message 53] Kai: ""The police are here. They want to talk to me.""
[Message 54] Leo: ""Cooperate with them, Kai. Tell them everything you know.""
[Message 55] Sam: ""I’m so sorry Kai, she always spoke highly of you.""
[Message 56] River: ""Yeah, just tell them the truth.""
[Message 57] Kai: ""I will. This just doesn't make any sense. Why would anyone do this?""
[Message 58] Leo: ""Maybe it was an accident? A faulty wire or something?""
[Message 59] Sam: ""Doubtful, with that fire.""
[Message 60] River: ""Maybe someone was jealous of her success as a judge. Someone involved with religious extremism.""
[Message 61] Kai: ""I don't know... I just don't know. The Henderson case... that's the only thing that comes to mind. Someone must've hated the way she judged.""
[Message 62] Leo: ""Hate's a strong word. People get mad, but they don't usually resort to this.""
[Message 63] Sam: ""Leo's right. It's probably some random act of violence.""
[Message 64] River: ""Or maybe she knew too much about something. ""
[Message 65] Kai: ""I have to go. The police are waiting.""
[Message 66] Leo: ""Good luck, Kai. We're here for you.""

[Message 68] River: ""Stay strong.""
[Message 69] Leo: ""This is insane. I can't believe Amelia is really gone.""
[Message 70] Sam: ""Me neither. She was so young. Did she have any family in town?""
[Message 71] River: ""Just her brother, I think. This is going to destroy him.""
[Message 72] Leo: ""I saw River leaving the library around Dead of Night . It might be nothing, but thought I should mention it.""
[Message 73] Sam: ""We should organize something for her. A memorial or something.""
[Message 74] River: ""Yeah, that's a good idea. We need to honor her memory. I intended to stop by later and see if she needed anything before, but never did.""
[Message 75] Leo: ""We could set up a GoFundMe for her brother. Help with funeral expenses.""
[Message 76] Sam: ""That's a great idea, Leo. Let's do it. I can help with the wording.""
[Message 77] River: ""I'm in too. I can design the banner.""
[Message 78] Leo: ""This feels so surreal. Like a bad dream.""
[Message 79] Sam: ""It does. I keep expecting her to text me back about the pizza.""
[Message 80] River: ""Guys, the police are probably going to be asking us questions too. We need to be prepared.""
[Message 81] Leo: ""Prepared? What do you mean?""
[Message 82] Sam: ""Just... think about what you're going to say. You know, stick to the facts.""
[Message 83] River: ""Yeah, don't say anything that could be misinterpreted.""
[Message 84] Leo: ""Are you guys implying something? I have nothing to hide.""
[Message 85] Sam: ""No, of course not, Leo. Just being cautious.""
[Message 86] River: ""Yeah, same here. Just want to make sure we're all on the same page.""
[Message 87] Leo: ""Well, I was at home all night. Watching that terrible reality show.""
[Message 88] Sam: ""I was working on a project. I can show you the files.""
[Message 89] River: ""I was at the gym. Trying to de-stress. This is so awful. I can’t believe that person is going to going away for a long time for this""
[Message 90] Leo: ""Okay, good. Just wanted to clear the air. I'm still processing this whole thing.""
[Message 91] Sam: ""Me too. It's going to take a while to sink in.""
[Message 92] River: ""This whole situation is awful. I still can't believe it, hopefully police finds the culpable parties.""
[Message 93] Kai: ""They let me go. Said I was just a concerned friend. They're investigating the Henderson case and possible arson. Thanks for your support, guys.""

[Message 16] MARK: Yeah, I saw Liam at the food court. He looked angry.

[Message 20] ANNA: Guys, let's not jump to conclusions. This is a tragedy.
[Message 21] MARK: True, true. But Liam *did* seem extra on edge lately. He always hated Jamie.

[Message 57] CHLOE: Hmm. Okay.
[Message 58] LIAM: Seriously, guys. Drop it.
[Message 59] CHLOE: I heard someone say they saw you going to that abandoned storage room near the food court that afternoon, Liam.
[Message 60] LIAM: That's a lie. I was buying shoes at Foot Locker.
[Message 61] CHLOE: Hope you were. I saw Jamie's personal belongings in the dumpster.
[Message 62] LIAM: What does that have to do with me?
[Message 63] MARK: Liam, were you aware that dumping personal belongings like that would have consequences?
[Message 64] LIAM: I didn't do it. I went straight home after getting those shoes. My mom can vouch for me.

484,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey Jordan! How's the trade show going for you so far?
[Message 2] Jordan: Hey Alex! It's actually going pretty well. A lot of interested people. How about you?
[Message 3] Alex: Same here! More interest than I expected. Did you manage to catch the keynote this morning?
[Message 4] Jordan: I did! It was alright. A bit too much buzzword bingo for my liking. What did you think?
[Message 5] Alex: Agreed! Needed more substance. But hey, free coffee, right?
[Message 6] Jordan: Exactly! Did you see the demo from that AI company? Pretty wild stuff.
[Message 7] Alex: I missed it! Tell me about it.
[Message 8] Jordan: Basically, they're claiming it can automate 80% of my job. Slightly terrifying.
[Message 9] Alex: Wow! Automation is really changing things. On a different note, did you find a good place for lunch yet? I'm starving.
[Message 10] Jordan: Not yet, but I saw a food truck outside with some interesting options. Wanna check it out after the next round of demos?
[Message 11] Alex: Sounds good! So, what's been your biggest personal achievement lately? Trade show aside.
[Message 12] Jordan: Ooh, good question. I finally finished that data analysis certification I've been working on. Pretty stoked about that.
[Message 13] Alex: That's awesome, Jordan! Congratulations! It's a huge accomplishment.
[Message 14] Jordan: Thanks! What about you, Alex? Anything exciting happening outside of electrifying the world?
[Message 15] Alex: Well, I've been mentoring a junior electrician at the company. That's been really rewarding.
[Message 16] Jordan: Mentoring? That's fantastic! I've always thought about doing that, but I'm not sure I have the patience.
[Message 17] Alex: It definitely requires patience! But seeing someone grow and learn is incredibly fulfilling. Plus, it keeps me on my toes!
[Message 18] Jordan: I can imagine. What's the most challenging part of mentoring, in your experience?
[Message 19] Alex: Probably tailoring my approach to each individual. Everyone learns differently, and it's important to adapt.
[Message 20] Jordan: That makes a lot of sense. It's like customizing a solution for each person.
[Message 21] Alex: Exactly! And sometimes, it's just about being a good listener and offering encouragement.
[Message 22] Jordan: True. Sometimes people just need someone to believe in them.
[Message 23] Alex: Precisely. And for me, it's reminded me how much I enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge.
[Message 24] Jordan: That's amazing, Alex. It sounds like you're making a real difference.
[Message 25] Alex: I hope so! It's definitely given me a new perspective on my career. Speaking of which, how's that certification helping you?
[Message 26] Jordan: It's opening up some new doors for me, actually. I've been exploring different analytical models and their applications.
[Message 27] Alex: That's great to hear! I'm always impressed by people who are constantly learning and improving.
[Message 28] Jordan: It's a necessity in the tech world, haha. Gotta stay relevant!
[Message 29] Alex: No kidding! Things are changing so fast. I remember when everything was analog...
[Message 30] Jordan: Haha, I can only imagine! My grandparents tell stories about that.
[Message 31] Alex: It was a different time, that's for sure. Simpler in some ways, more complicated in others.
[Message 32] Jordan: I bet. So, back to the mentoring thing… any specific advice for someone thinking about getting started?
[Message 33] Alex: Start small. Maybe offer to help a colleague with a specific project or task. See how it goes.
[Message 34] Jordan: Good idea. Baby steps.
[Message 35] Alex: Exactly! And be prepared to learn from your mentee as well. It's a two-way street.
[Message 36] Jordan: That's a great point. I hadn't really thought about it that way.
[Message 37] Alex: Oh yeah, they often have fresh perspectives and new ideas. Keeps you from getting stuck in your ways.
[Message 38] Jordan: I like that. I tend to get tunnel vision sometimes.
[Message 39] Alex: We all do! It's important to be open to new approaches.
[Message 40] Jordan: Definitely. What kind of painting do you do, by the way? I vaguely remember you mentioning it before.
[Message 41] Alex: Mostly landscapes. I find it very relaxing and a good way to de-stress after a long day.
[Message 42] Jordan: That sounds lovely. I'm more of a car person myself. Love tinkering with engines.
[Message 43] Alex: Ah, a fellow tinkerer! I can appreciate that. There's something satisfying about fixing things with your own hands.
[Message 44] Jordan: Absolutely! What's the biggest electrical challenge you've tackled lately?
[Message 45] Alex: Recently, it was rewiring an old house with some seriously outdated and dangerous wiring. Definitely kept me on my toes.
[Message 46] Jordan: Yikes! That sounds like a nightmare.
[Message 47] Alex: It was… interesting. But I got it done safely and up to code, which is the most important thing.
[Message 48] Jordan: Absolutely. Safety first!
[Message 49] Alex: Always. Speaking of which, I think it's time for that food truck. My stomach is starting to rumble.
[Message 50] Jordan: Haha, mine too! Let's go. What are you in the mood for?
[Message 51] Alex: Something with protein! I need energy for the afternoon sessions.
[Message 52] Jordan: Okay, let's see what they have. Maybe some kind of grilled meat?
[Message 53] Alex: Sounds perfect! Lead the way!
[Message 54] Jordan: Alright, follow me! I think I saw a BBQ place down the street.
[Message 55] Alex: Wonderful! This trade show is making me hungry.
[Message 56] Jordan: It is! All that talking and walking around.
[Message 57] Alex: Exactly. Makes you feel like you earned your lunch!
[Message 58] Jordan: Definitely. Did you hear any good jokes at the keynote?
[Message 59] Alex: Just the usual tech puns. Nothing too memorable.
[Message 60] Jordan: Yeah, same here. I need some better material.
[Message 61] Alex: Me too! We should start a collection of electrician jokes.
[Message 62] Jordan: Haha! I'm in! I'll contribute some data analyst humor too.
[Message 63] Alex: Perfect! We can become the trade show comedians!
[Message 64] Jordan: Maybe we should stick to our day jobs.
[Message 65] Alex: Probably a good idea! But it's fun to think about!
[Message 66] Jordan: It is! Okay, here's the food truck! What looks good?
[Message 67] Alex: Ooh, they have brisket! I'm getting that.
[Message 68] Jordan: Brisket sounds amazing! I'm going for the pulled pork.
[Message 69] Alex: Excellent choices! We have good taste.
[Message 70] Jordan: Indeed! Alright, let's order!
[Message 71] Alex: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 72] Jordan: Okay, got our food! This smells incredible.
[Message 73] Alex: It does! Let's find a table.
[Message 74] Jordan: There's one over there! Perfect.
[Message 75] Alex: Awesome! Let's dig in.
[Message 76] Jordan: Mmm, this pulled pork is delicious!
[Message 77] Alex: This brisket is fantastic! So tender.
[Message 78] Jordan: I'm glad we decided to come here.
[Message 79] Alex: Me too! Best decision of the day.
[Message 80] Jordan: Agreed! So, after lunch, what sessions are you planning on hitting?
[Message 81] Alex: I want to check out the one on renewable energy integration.
[Message 82] Jordan: Oh, that sounds interesting. I'm going to the one on data security.
[Message 83] Alex: Important stuff! We all need to be more aware of that.
[Message 84] Jordan: Definitely. It's a constant battle to stay ahead of the threats.
[Message 85] Alex: I can imagine. Cybersecurity is a whole different world.
[Message 86] Jordan: It is. It's like a never-ending arms race.
[Message 87] Alex: Scary! But necessary.
[Message 88] Jordan: Absolutely. So, are you working on any interesting personal projects right now?
[Message 89] Alex: I'm trying to build a smart home system for my house. It's a slow process.
[Message 90] Jordan: That sounds cool! What kind of features are you including?
[Message 91] Alex: Automated lighting, temperature control, security system… the whole shebang.
[Message 92] Jordan: Nice! That's ambitious.
[Message 93] Alex: Yeah, well, I like a challenge. Plus, it's a good way to learn new things.
[Message 94] Jordan: True! Keeps the mind sharp. I'm just trying to keep my car running these days.
[Message 95] Alex: What kind of car do you have?
[Message 96] Jordan: It's an old Mustang. I love it, but it's a constant work in progress.
[Message 97] Alex: Classic! Those are beautiful cars.
[Message 98] Jordan: Thanks! It's my baby.
[Message 99] Alex: I can understand that. Some things are just worth the effort.
[Message 100] Jordan: Exactly. So, how long have you been an electrician?
[Message 101] Alex: ""7"" + ""4"" + "" years now. Started right out of school.
[Message 102] Jordan: Wow! That's a long time! You must have seen a lot of changes in the industry.
[Message 103] Alex: You have no idea! From vacuum tubes to microchips. It's been quite a ride.
[Message 104] Jordan: I bet! It's amazing how much technology has advanced in such a short period.
[Message 105] Alex: It is. Sometimes I feel like I'm living in the future.
[Message 106] Jordan: I know what you mean! It's hard to keep up sometimes.
[Message 107] Alex: Tell me about it! That's why I appreciate opportunities like this trade show.
[Message 108] Jordan: Me too. It's a good way to network and learn about new developments.
[Message 109] Alex: Absolutely. And to eat delicious BBQ!
[Message 110] Jordan: Haha! True! So, ready for the afternoon sessions?
[Message 111] Alex: As ready as I'll ever be! Let's do it.
[Message 112] Jordan: Alright! Let's head back inside.
[Message 113] Alex: Sounds good!
[Message 114] Jordan: Okay, I'm going to head towards the data security session.
[Message 115] Alex: And I'm off to renewable energy. Catch you later!
[Message 116] Jordan: See you later, Alex! Have a good one!
[Message 117] Alex: You too, Jordan! Enjoy the data!
[Message 118] Jordan: Will do! And you enjoy the sun! (virtually, of course)
[Message 119] Alex: Haha, exactly! Bye!
[Message 120] Jordan: Bye!
[Message 121] Alex: (Later that evening) Hey Jordan, just got back to the hotel. That renewable energy session was surprisingly good!
[Message 122] Jordan: (Later that evening) Hey Alex! Glad you enjoyed it! The data security one was pretty intense. Lots to think about.
[Message 123] Alex: Anything particularly interesting?
[Message 124] Jordan: Just how vulnerable everything is, honestly. Makes you want to unplug everything and live in a cabin in the woods.
[Message 125] Alex: Haha, I hear you! But then how would you charge your phone?
[Message 126] Jordan: Good point! Maybe a solar-powered cabin?
[Message 127] Alex: Now you're talking! So, any dinner plans?
[Message 128] Jordan: Not yet. Thinking about just ordering room service. I'm exhausted.
[Message 129] Alex: Same here. All that information overload.
[Message 130] Jordan: Tell me about it! I think my brain is full.
[Message 131] Alex: Mine too! Well, enjoy your dinner!
[Message 132] Jordan: You too, Alex! Maybe we can grab breakfast tomorrow before heading out?
[Message 133] Alex: That sounds great! What time?
[Message 134] Jordan: How about 8 am in the hotel lobby?
[Message 135] Alex: Perfect! See you then.
[Message 136] Jordan: Sounds good! Good night, Alex!
[Message 137] Alex: Good night, Jordan! Sleep well!
[Message 138] Jordan: You too!
[Message 139] Alex: (Next morning) Hey Jordan, I'm in the lobby. Running a few minutes late, but almost there!
[Message 140] Jordan: (Next morning) No worries, Alex! I'm here already. Just grabbing a coffee.
[Message 141] Alex: Great! See you in a few!
[Message 142] Jordan: Sounds good!
[Message 143] Alex: Okay, I'm here! Let's get some breakfast!

[Message 4] CHLOE: Yeah, two bartenders. Marco and Sofia, I heard.
[Message 5] LIAM: Marco? I knew Marco! He was always so carefree.
[Message 6] MAYA: Sofia too! She always had a smile.
[Message 7] DAVID: Yeah, terrible. I was actually there earlier that evening.
[Message 8] CHLOE: Really, David? Did you see anything strange?
[Message 9] DAVID: Nah, nothing out of the ordinary. Just the usual crowd.
[Message 10] LIAM: Crazy how things can change so fast.
[Message 11] MAYA: Agreed. Makes you think.
[Message 12] CHLOE: Seriously! Anyway, you guys watching that new show tonight?
[Message 13] LIAM: Maybe. Depends if I can sleep. This whole thing is giving me the creeps.
[Message 14] MAYA: I know, right? I might just stay in and read.
[Message 15] DAVID: I need to catch up on some work. This is such a distraction.
[Message 16] CHLOE: Okay, well, talk to you all later. Stay safe!
[Message 17] LIAM: You too, Chloe.

[Message 21] DAVID: Just tired, Maya. Long day.
[Message 22] MAYA: Okay. Just checking.
[Message 23] LIAM: Hey Maya, you know David well, right?
[Message 24] MAYA: Yeah, we've known each other for a while. Why?
[Message 25] LIAM: Just wondering if he’s been acting weird lately.
[Message 26] MAYA: He's been stressed about work, that's all.
[Message 27] LIAM: Right, work.
[Message 28] CHLOE: GUYS! They said they found an ice pick!
[Message 29] LIAM: An ice pick? Seriously?
[Message 30] MAYA: That's so specific and disturbing.
[Message 31] DAVID: Wow. That's…intense.
[Message 32] CHLOE: I know! Who even owns an ice pick these days?
[Message 33] LIAM: Maybe someone who works with ice sculptures?
[Message 34] MAYA: Good point, Liam.
[Message 35] DAVID: Let's not jump to conclusions. The police will figure it out.

[Message 74] LIAM: True. But still…
[Message 75] CHLOE: Hey guys, just saw something weird.
[Message 76] LIAM: What is it?
[Message 77] MAYA: Tell us!
[Message 78] CHLOE: I saw Jamie, Marco's ex, buying an ice pick at the hardware store yesterday afternoon.
[Message 79] LIAM: Jamie? No way!
[Message 80] MAYA: Seriously? That's…that's really bad.
[Message 81] DAVID: Wow.
[Message 82] CHLOE: I know, right? I didn't think anything of it at the time, but now…
[Message 83] LIAM: Did you see her actually buy it?
[Message 84] CHLOE: Yeah, I saw her pay for it and leave.
[Message 85] MAYA: We need to tell the police!
[Message 86] DAVID: Hold on. Let's not jump to conclusions. Maybe she needed it for something else.
[Message 87] CHLOE: Like what, David?
[Message 88] LIAM: Yeah, what other reason would she have?
[Message 89] DAVID: I don't know! Maybe she's making an ice sculpture!
[Message 90] MAYA: That's a bit of a stretch, David.
[Message 91] CHLOE: Agreed. I'm calling the police.
[Message 92] LIAM: Good call.
[Message 93] MAYA: Let us know what they say.
[Message 94] DAVID: This is getting out of hand.
[Message 95] CHLOE: I just told them about Jamie. They said they'll look into it.
[Message 96] LIAM: Good.
[Message 97] MAYA: Thanks, Chloe.
[Message 98] DAVID: I still think we're making a mistake.
[Message 99] CHLOE: How can reporting a potential lead be a mistake, David?
[Message 100] LIAM: Exactly!
[Message 101] MAYA: He's probably just trying to be fair, guys.
[Message 102] DAVID: Thank you, Maya.
[Message 103] CHLOE: Whatever. I just hope they catch whoever did this.
[Message 104] LIAM: Me too.
[Message 105] MAYA: Agreed.
[Message 106] DAVID: Of course.
[Message 107] LIAM: Maya, can I ask you something personal?
[Message 108] MAYA: Sure, what's up?
[Message 109] LIAM: Do you think David is capable of something like that?
[Message 110] MAYA: I honestly don't know, Liam. I want to believe he's not, but…
[Message 111] LIAM: But what?
[Message 112] MAYA: He has a temper. He was fired last month for yelling at his boss.
[Message 113] LIAM: Yelling? That's it?
[Message 114] MAYA: No, he was also complaining about how he was gonna get rid of the manager. **(Mens Rea)**
[Message 115] LIAM: Wow.
[Message 116] CHLOE: Hey guys, police questioned Jamie. She said she bought the ice pick for a friend who's a sculptor.
[Message 117] LIAM: Sculptor, huh?
[Message 118] MAYA: Seems legit.
[Message 119] DAVID: See? I told you.
[Message 120] CHLOE: Yeah, but they're still investigating.
[Message 121] LIAM: Good.
[Message 122] MAYA: So, back to square one.

[Message 130] MAYA: Chloe, are you sure?
[Message 131] CHLOE: Yeah, it was late. Like, almost Late Evening.

[Message 133] DAVID: I told you, I was there earlier. I left around 8 PM.
[Message 134] CHLOE: No, David. It was later. I remember seeing you walk out, looking really angry.
[Message 135] LIAM: Angry about what, David?

[Message 137] DAVID: I already told you the truth! I left early! This is ridiculous!
[Message 138] CHLOE: I don't believe you.
[Message 139] LIAM: Me neither.
[Message 140] MAYA: David, if you know something, please tell us. It's important.
[Message 141] DAVID: I swear, I don't know anything! You guys are accusing me of murder! Do you know they are going away for a long time for this **(Punishment)**
[Message 142] CHLOE: Then why were you there so late?
[Message 143] LIAM: Yeah, why were you so angry?
[Message 144] MAYA: David, please.
[Message 145] DAVID: Fine! I was upset because Marco was hitting on me. I told him to stop, and I left. That's it!
[Message 146] CHLOE: Hitting on you?
[Message 147] LIAM: And you just left?
[Message 148] MAYA: Okay, that makes more sense.
[Message 149] DAVID: Yes! That's all that happened!
[Message 150] CHLOE: Okay, I guess that could be true.
[Message 151] LIAM: Still seems suspicious.
[Message 152] MAYA: Liam, give it a rest.
[Message 153] CHLOE: Yeah, Liam. Let's just let the police do their job.
[Message 154] LIAM: Fine.
[Message 155] DAVID: Thank you, Chloe.
[Message 156] CHLOE: But David, you should have told us that earlier.
[Message 157] LIAM: Yeah, that would have saved us a lot of trouble.
[Message 158] MAYA: True.

[Message 160] CHLOE: Okay, well, just be honest with us in the future.

[Message 169] MAYA: Seriously? This is bad...
[Message 170] LIAM: Yeah, he really seemed to have something against them.

493,"[Message 1] Liam: Hey guys, heard about what happened at Amusement Park last night? Crazy.
[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, it's all over the news. Two people dead. Awful.
[Message 3] Noah: Unbelievable. Anyone know who it was?
[Message 4] Liam: They said it was 9.  Bartender and that Security Guard.
[Message 5] Maya: Poor Mark (Bartender). He was such a creative guy. Always had a smile on his face.
[Message 6] Noah: And David (Security Guard) was just a kid. So withdrawn.
[Message 7] Liam: I saw Ben (Suspect 3) heading that way earlier that night. Wonder if he saw anything.
[Message 8] Maya: Maybe. Ben knows everyone in town.
[Message 9] Noah: Ben's always hanging around Amusement Park. It's like his second home.
[Message 10] Ben: Yo, what's up? Yeah, I was there. Didn't see anything though. Left early.
[Message 11] Liam: Early? What time is early for you, Ben?
[Message 12] Ben: Like, 11? Got bored. Headed home.
[Message 13] Maya: The news said it happened at Dead of Night. That's way later than 11.
[Message 14] Ben: News exaggerates everything, Maya.
[Message 15] Liam: Did anyone see where Alex (Suspect 1) and Chris (Suspect 2) was?
[Message 16] Maya: Alex? He was complaining about 9.  Bartender getting all the attention at work all day.
[Message 17] Noah: Chris was supposed to be working security last night, wasn't he?
[Message 18] Liam: Yeah, he swapped shifts with David (Security Guard) at the last minute. Weird, right?
[Message 19] Ben: Maybe Chris (Suspect 2) called in sick? Happens all the time.
[Message 20] Maya: Chris never calls in sick. He needs the money.
[Message 21] Liam: This is messed up. Two people are dead.
[Message 22] Noah: Agreed. I hope they catch whoever did this. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 23] Ben: For real. People getting hurt ain't cool.
[Message 24] Maya: You guys think it was a robbery gone wrong?
[Message 25] Liam: Could be. That place has been hit before.
[Message 26] Noah: Maybe. But Mark (Bartender) and David (Security Guard) seemed like nice guys. Who would want to hurt them?
[Message 27] Ben: People are messed up, Noah. You know that.
[Message 28] Maya: True.
[Message 29] Liam: I heard Alex (Suspect 1) and Mark (Bartender) got into a fight last week. Something about Alex (Suspect 1) getting fired.
[Message 30] Maya: Seriously? I didn't know that. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 31] Noah: Alex (Suspect 1) has a temper.
[Message 32] Ben: I heard Alex (Suspect 1) was saying he wanted to get rid of him.
[Message 33] Liam: So Alex (Suspect 1) hated 9.  Bartender? Makes him look real suspicious now.
[Message 34] Maya: What about Chris (Suspect 2)? Anything weird about him lately?
[Message 35] Noah: He's been acting jumpy. Like he's hiding something.
[Message 36] Ben: Maybe he's just stressed about money.
[Message 37] Liam: Anyone know what time Chris (Suspect 2) left?
[Message 38] Maya: No idea. I didn't see him at all last night.
[Message 39] Noah: I saw Chris (Suspect 2) near Amusement Park around 10. He was walking fast.
[Message 40] Ben: Lots of people walk near Amusement Park. Doesn't mean anything.
[Message 41] Liam: I guess. But it's still weird.
[Message 42] Maya: This whole thing is weird.

[Message 45] Liam: Where are you going, Ben?
[Message 46] Ben: Just... out. Don't worry about it.

[Message 49] Liam: No idea. But I don't like it.

[Message 51] Liam: Hey, anyone remember what Chris (Suspect 2) was wearing last night?
[Message 52] Maya: I don't think I saw him.
[Message 53] Noah: Dark jacket, I think. And jeans.
[Message 54] Liam: Okay. Just checking.
[Message 55] Maya: Why?
[Message 56] Liam: No reason. Just trying to piece things together.
[Message 57] Noah: This is going to haunt me.
[Message 58] Liam: Me too, Noah. Me too.
[Message 59] Maya: Lets change the subject. What is everyone having for dinner?
[Message 60] Noah: Pizza.
[Message 61] Ben: Sushi
[Message 62] Liam: Nice! I am thinking of making stake.
[Message 63] Maya: Good food choices!
[Message 64] Liam: So, back to the case. Anyone else think Alex (Suspect 1) and Chris (Suspect 2) could be working together?
[Message 65] Maya: Hmm, never thought of that.
[Message 66] Noah: They have been friends for a long time.
[Message 67] Ben: That is a long shot. But possible.
[Message 68] Liam: What if they planned this all along? Chris (Suspect 2) swapping shifts, Alex (Suspect 1) arguing with 9.  Bartender...?
[Message 69] Maya: You are thinking too hard. That is stuff out of movies.
[Message 70] Noah: It could be that Chris (Suspect 2) wanted the job from David (Security Guard).
[Message 71] Liam: Okay, maybe, but let's not rule anything out yet.
[Message 72] Maya: True. This is a weird case.
[Message 73] Ben: True.
[Message 74] Liam: Did anyone else get weird vibes when Chris (Suspect 2) was talking about David (Security Guard)?
[Message 75] Maya: Now that you mention it... yes.
[Message 76] Noah: Yes, he was very emotional.
[Message 77] Ben: I think that he was shocked that David (Security Guard) actually died!
[Message 78] Liam: Why do you say it like that, Ben? Like you knew something was going to happen?
[Message 79] Maya: Yes, that is right Ben!
[Message 80] Noah: Ben, are you okay?
[Message 81] Ben: What are you implying?
[Message 82] Liam: Just asking.
[Message 83] Maya: Yeah, all of us are just a little worried.
[Message 84] Noah: Agree!
[Message 85] Ben: Relax guys, I am fine! I was just saying it is a shame.
[Message 86] Liam: If you say so.
[Message 87] Maya: True.
[Message 88] Noah: We should focus on finding the real killer.
[Message 89] Ben: True.
[Message 90] Liam: Okay, new question. Did anyone see Alex (Suspect 1) with a rope recently?
[Message 91] Maya: Why a rope?
[Message 92] Noah: Asphyxiation by strangulation!
[Message 93] Ben: Woah!
[Message 94] Liam: Just a thought.
[Message 95] Maya: I think I saw him buying Asphyxiation by strangulation at the store!
[Message 96] Noah: When was this?
[Message 97] Ben: That is a bit of a coincidence.
[Message 98] Liam: I need to make a call. Will catch up later.
[Message 99] Maya: Okay!
[Message 100] Noah: Sure.
[Message 101] Ben: Bye.
[Message 102] Maya: So, what do we do now?
[Message 103] Noah: I do not know? Maybe call the cops!
[Message 104] Maya: They wont believe us!
[Message 105] Noah: Yes they will!
[Message 106] Maya: What if we are wrong and get someone innocent in trouble?
[Message 107] Noah: I think this needs to be done.
[Message 108] Maya: I guess.
[Message 109] Liam: (Back) Sorry about that, had to call someone. So back to the issue at hand. Where were we?
[Message 110] Maya: We were about to call the police.
[Message 111] Noah: Yes that is right Liam!
[Message 112] Ben: Are you crazy?
[Message 113] Liam: Why?
[Message 114] Maya: Why do you care?
[Message 115] Noah: What is wrong Ben?
[Message 116] Ben: This is stupid.
[Message 117] Liam: Maybe you should tell us what you know.
[Message 118] Maya: We are all friends here Ben!
[Message 119] Noah: Yes Ben, tell us.
[Message 120] Ben: Fine, I was there when it happened.
[Message 121] Liam: You were there, that means you saw something!

[Message 123] Noah: Please tell us.
[Message 124] Ben: I saw Chris (Suspect 2) and Alex (Suspect 1) together.

[Message 130] Maya: About the money?
[Message 131] Noah: About that job?
[Message 132] Ben: I could not hear. Then I left.

[Message 142] Noah: Yes, I am!
[Message 143] Liam: Chris (Suspect 2) knew about the cameras right?

[Message 145] Noah: He probably told Alex (Suspect 1)!

[Message 11] Sarah: ""Last night?""
[Message 12] Mark: ""Things got… complicated.""
[Message 13] Sarah: ""Complicated how?""
[Message 14] Mark: ""Just… complicated. In a parenting kind of way.""
[Message 15] Sarah: ""I understand.""
[Message 16] Mark: ""Do you?""
[Message 17] Sarah: ""To some extent. We've all been there, right?""
[Message 18] Mark: ""I hope so. This felt... different.""
[Message 19] Sarah: ""Different bad, or different… educational?""
[Message 20] Mark: ""Definitely different bad.""
[Message 21] Sarah: ""Ouch.""
[Message 22] Mark: ""Yeah. Long night.""
[Message 23] Sarah: ""I can imagine. Anything I can do?""
[Message 24] Mark: ""Not unless you're a magician who can rewind time.""

[Message 26] Mark: ""It's okay. Just… needed to vent, I guess.""
[Message 27] Sarah: ""Vent away. I'm a good listener.""
[Message 28] Mark: ""It involved... decisions.""
[Message 29] Sarah: ""Decisions?""
[Message 30] Mark: ""Yeah. Less than ideal ones.""
[Message 31] Sarah: ""Whose decisions?""
[Message 32] Mark: ""That's… part of the complication.""
[Message 33] Sarah: ""Ah. I see.""
[Message 34] Mark: ""Do you?""
[Message 35] Sarah: ""Maybe a little. Sometimes it's better not to know the specifics.""
[Message 36] Mark: ""Probably.""
[Message 37] Sarah: ""So, how's work?""
[Message 38] Mark: ""A welcome distraction, actually.""
[Message 39] Sarah: ""Good.""

[Message 42] Mark: ""You're lucky.""
[Message 43] Sarah: ""Perspective. I try to keep it.""
[Message 44] Mark: ""I used to have perspective.""
[Message 45] Sarah: ""It comes and goes. Like dental appointments.""
[Message 46] Mark: ""True enough.""
[Message 47] Sarah: ""So, what are you going to do about… it?""
[Message 48] Mark: ""Honestly? I have no idea.""
[Message 49] Sarah: ""That's fair.""
[Message 50] Mark: ""Just hoping it doesn't… escalate.""
[Message 51] Sarah: ""Escalate how?""

[Message 54] Mark: ""Yeah. You know…""
[Message 55] Sarah: ""No, I don't know. But I'm getting a sense.""
[Message 56] Mark: ""A sense of…?""

[Message 58] Mark: ""Maybe.""
[Message 59] Sarah: ""Well, I'm here if you need anything. Anything at all.""

[Message 7] Chloe: ""Poisoning via inhalation? That's… intense.""
[Message 8] Noah: ""Damn. Wonder if the cops have any leads.""

[Message 2] Ben: ""Tell me about it. Waiting for the 886 myself. You headed far?""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Just up to Legacy West. Had a job interview earlier.""
[Message 4] Ben: ""Oh, really? How'd it go?""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Felt…okay. It was for a teaching position. They asked a lot about classroom management.""
[Message 6] Ben: ""Classroom management, huh? Sounds tough. My niece is a teacher; she always complains about that.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""It's definitely a challenge. Kids these days... Anyway, what do you do, Ben?""
[Message 8] Ben: ""I'm a data analyst. Work downtown.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Data analyst? That sounds interesting. Lots of numbers, I imagine.""
[Message 10] Ben: ""Tons. It's all about finding patterns and insights. You need a good head for finance, actually.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Finance? I know absolutely nothing about finance. I mostly stick to art supplies and lesson planning.""
[Message 12] Ben: ""Haha, fair enough. But even as a teacher, understanding basic finance can be super helpful. Managing your budget, saving for retirement…""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Retirement? Don't remind me! At 95, I should BE retired. Though, I still enjoy teaching. Keeps me young.""
[Message 14] Ben: ""95?! Wow! That's incredible. You don't look a day over 70!""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Flattery will get you everywhere, my friend. Good genes, I guess.""
[Message 16] Ben: ""Seriously impressive. And still teaching? Amazing. Back to finance though, even small things like choosing the right credit card can make a difference.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Credit cards? I have one, but I mostly use cash.""
[Message 18] Ben: ""Cash is good for budgeting, but credit cards can offer rewards, cashback…plus, building credit is important.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Building credit at my age? What for?""
[Message 20] Ben: ""Well, not necessarily *you* specifically, but for younger people, it's crucial for mortgages, loans, even renting apartments.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Ah, right. Makes sense. I just remember my parents being terrified of debt. Always paid everything in cash.""
[Message 22] Ben: ""That was the old school mentality. Nowadays, it's about leveraging debt responsibly. Knowing the difference between good debt and bad debt.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Good debt versus bad debt? Tell me more.""
[Message 24] Ben: ""Good debt is something that appreciates in value or helps you earn more money – like a mortgage (hopefully appreciating) or a student loan (leading to a higher-paying job). Bad debt is things like high-interest credit card debt or loans for depreciating assets.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""So, my student loan from... whenever... was good debt, presumably. Assuming my teaching job paid well.""
[Message 26] Ben: ""Exactly! Even investments can be considered 'good debt' if you borrow to invest and the returns outweigh the interest. But that's a whole other ballgame.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Investments... I tried stocks once. Lost a fortune.""
[Message 28] Ben: ""Yeah, the stock market can be volatile. It's all about understanding risk tolerance and diversifying your portfolio. Not putting all your eggs in one basket.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Diversifying... that sounds complicated.""
[Message 30] Ben: ""It doesn't have to be! There are tons of resources online, and financial advisors can help. Even just investing in a broad market index fund is a decent start.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Index fund... I'll have to look that up. Thanks for the tip!""
[Message 32] Ben: ""No problem! I could talk about finance all day. It's my passion, nerdy as it sounds.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Not nerdy at all! Everyone needs to understand it. I just wish they taught this stuff in schools. Instead, we get trigonometry.""
[Message 34] Ben: ""Trigonometry... now that *is* useless for most people. Unless you're building bridges, I guess.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Exactly! I haven't used trigonometry since I left school. But understanding a budget? Vital.""
[Message 36] Ben: ""Completely agree. Financial literacy should be a core subject. Teaches responsibility and empowers people to make informed decisions.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Speaking of informed decisions, I'm starving. Any good restaurants near Legacy West?""
[Message 38] Ben: ""Tons! Depends what you're in the mood for. Legacy Hall has a great variety of options.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Legacy Hall... I'll check it out. Maybe celebrate surviving the interview.""
[Message 40] Ben: ""Definitely celebrate! You deserve it. What subject do you teach, by the way?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Art. Painting, mostly.""
[Message 42] Ben: ""Ah, that's awesome! I wish I was more artistic. I can barely draw a stick figure.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Everyone has some artistic talent. It's just a matter of finding it. What about singing? You mentioned an interest in that earlier.""
[Message 44] Ben: ""Yeah, I love to sing! Mostly karaoke nights with friends. Nothing serious.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Karaoke! That sounds fun. I haven't done karaoke in ages.""
[Message 46] Ben: ""You should come sometime! It's a great stress reliever. Much cheaper than therapy, too. More fun, certainly.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Cheaper than therapy... now *that's* a good financial tip!""
[Message 48] Ben: ""Haha, exactly! Kill two birds with one stone. Save money *and* have a good time.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""I like your thinking. Maybe after this interview, I'll treat myself to a karaoke session.""
[Message 50] Ben: ""Do it! You won't regret it. What's your go-to karaoke song?""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Oh, I don't know... something upbeat and silly. Maybe 'Dancing Queen' by ABBA.""
[Message 52] Ben: ""Classic choice! Can't go wrong with ABBA. My go-to is usually something by Queen. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' if I'm feeling ambitious.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""'Bohemian Rhapsody'! Wow, that's a challenge.""
[Message 54] Ben: ""It is! But it's so much fun. Especially when everyone sings along to the opera part.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""I can imagine! Alright, you've convinced me. I'm going to look for a karaoke bar near Legacy West.""
[Message 56] Ben: ""Excellent! Report back on how it goes. Maybe we can even meet up sometime and have a karaoke battle.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""A karaoke battle! I like the sound of that. Consider it a date...a karaoke date, that is.""
[Message 58] Ben: ""A karaoke date it is! I'm already practicing my Freddie Mercury impersonation.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""I'll start warming up my vocal cords. Prepare to be amazed by my rendition of 'Dancing Queen'.""
[Message 60] Ben: ""I'm looking forward to it! So, back to the job interview – what grade level are you hoping to teach?""
[Message 61] Alex: ""High school. I love working with the older kids. They're more creative and have more interesting ideas.""
[Message 62] Ben: ""High school art... that sounds like a lot of fun. Do you get to see some pretty wild creations?""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Absolutely! They come up with some amazing stuff. Sometimes I'm blown away by their talent.""
[Message 64] Ben: ""That must be rewarding. To see young people expressing themselves through art.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""It is. It's one of the reasons I still love teaching after all these years.""
[Message 66] Ben: ""That's fantastic. Finding something you're passionate about is so important. Makes all the difference.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""Exactly. And you seem passionate about data analysis. What do you enjoy most about it?""
[Message 68] Ben: ""I love the challenge of finding patterns and insights in complex data. It's like solving a puzzle. And I like that my work can actually help businesses make better decisions.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""So you're basically a detective, but with numbers instead of clues.""
[Message 70] Ben: ""Haha, that's a good way to put it! A data detective. I might have to steal that.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Be my guest! I have plenty more where that came from.""
[Message 72] Ben: ""I appreciate that! You seem like a very creative person. It's refreshing.""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Well, I try. Life's too short to be boring.""
[Message 74] Ben: ""Couldn't agree more. Gotta make the most of every day. Speaking of which, my bus is finally here!""
[Message 75] Alex: ""Lucky you! Still waiting for mine. Have a good evening, Ben!""
[Message 76] Ben: ""You too, Alex! Good luck with the job and the karaoke!""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Thanks! I'll let you know how it goes.""
[Message 78] Ben: ""Sounds good! See ya around.""
[Message 79] Alex: ""Bye!""
[Message 80] Alex: ""(Sigh) Still no bus...""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Maybe I should just call a rideshare. But that's so expensive!""
[Message 82] Alex: ""Okay, deep breaths. I can wait a little longer. At least the weather is nice.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""I wonder if that job paid well enough for me to finally get that new easel I've been wanting.""
[Message 84] Alex: ""Or maybe I should invest that money... Ben would be proud.""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Ugh, finance is so confusing. I just want to paint.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Focus, Alex, focus! Think happy thoughts. Think paint.""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Maybe I'll paint a picture of a karaoke night. That would be fun.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""A brightly colored painting with lots of energy. Perfect!""
[Message 89] Alex: ""Okay, that's it. I'm getting distracted. Time to check the bus schedule again.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""Still delayed! What is going on?!""
[Message 91] Alex: ""This is ridiculous. I'm going to be late for everything.""
[Message 92] Alex: ""Wait a minute... is that my bus coming?""
[Message 93] Alex: ""Yes! Finally!""
[Message 94] Alex: ""About time! Let's go, let's go!""
[Message 95] Alex: ""Okay, I'm on the bus. Now to figure out where that karaoke bar is...""
[Message 96] Alex: ""Aha! Found one! 'The Stage Door' - sounds promising.""
[Message 97] Alex: ""Only a few minutes from Legacy West. Perfect!""
[Message 98] Alex: ""Okay, job interview, here I come! And then, karaoke!""
[Message 99] Alex: ""I wonder if they have 'Dancing Queen' on their playlist...""
[Message 100] Alex: ""They better! I've been practicing all day.""
[Message 101] Alex: ""Alright, time to put on my game face and ace this interview.""
[Message 102] Alex: ""I got this! I'm a fantastic teacher!""
[Message 103] Alex: ""And I'm a pretty good karaoke singer... allegedly.""
[Message 104] Alex: ""Okay, here we go! Wish me luck, virtual friends!""
[Message 105] Chloe: ""Hey Alex! How did the interview go?""
[Message 106] Alex: ""Chloe! Hey! It went...okay. I think. Hard to tell.""
[Message 107] Chloe: ""Fingers crossed for you! Did you get a chance to check out Legacy Hall?""
[Message 108] Alex: ""Not yet! Heading there now. Planning on hitting up a karaoke bar after.""
[Message 109] Chloe: ""Karaoke! Sounds like fun! Which bar are you thinking of?""
[Message 110] Alex: ""'The Stage Door'. Have you heard of it?""
[Message 111] Chloe: ""I think so! Isn't that the one with the neon lights?""
[Message 112] Alex: ""Probably! I just picked it randomly online.""
[Message 113] Chloe: ""Well, good luck! Let me know how it is! And if you need a karaoke partner sometime, I'm always up for it!""
[Message 114] Alex: ""Definitely! A karaoke partner is always welcome. What's your go-to song?""
[Message 115] Chloe: ""'I Will Survive' by Gloria Gaynor. It's a classic!""
[Message 116] Alex: ""Another classic! Seems like we have good taste in karaoke music.""
[Message 117] Chloe: ""Indeed! So, back to the interview... what kind of questions did they ask?""
[Message 118] Alex: ""Lots about classroom management, as I mentioned. Also about my teaching philosophy and how I incorporate technology into my lessons.""
[Message 119] Chloe: ""Technology in art class? That's interesting! What kind of tech do you use?""
[Message 120] Alex: ""Digital art software, online resources, virtual museum tours... the possibilities are endless!""
[Message 121] Chloe: ""Wow, that's awesome! It's amazing how technology has changed everything, even art.""
[Message 122] Alex: ""It is! And it keeps things fresh and exciting for the students.""
[Message 123] Chloe: ""Definitely! So, what are you hoping to teach if you get the job?""
[Message 124] Alex: ""Painting, mostly. But also some drawing and sculpture. A little bit of everything.""
[Message 125] Chloe: ""Sounds like a dream job! I hope you get it!""
[Message 126] Alex: ""Thanks! Me too! I really enjoyed the interview, despite being nervous.""
[Message 127] Chloe: ""That's a good sign! If you felt comfortable, that means you made a good connection with the interviewers.""

[Message 2] Alex: Gorgeous sunset! And ugh, work. Thinking about it already, unfortunately. Big deadline looming.
[Message 3] Jordan: Sunset is stunning. David, what's on the pharmacy agenda tomorrow?
[Message 4] River: Beautiful! I’m actually looking forward to tomorrow. Got a new project kicking off.
[Message 5] David: Usual routine, Jordan. Filling prescriptions, counseling patients. The usual. How about you, River? What project?
[Message 6] Alex: What kind of project, River? Anything interesting?
[Message 7] Jordan: River's always got interesting projects! Alex, what's the deadline?
[Message 8] River: It's a new housing development downtown. Lots of moving parts. Excited but also a little nervous.
[Message 9] David: Housing development, eh? Sounds intense, River. Good luck with that!
[Message 10] Alex: Housing sounds stressful! Jordan, end of the week. It's a presentation.
[Message 11] Jordan: Presentations are the worst! I always get stage fright.
[Message 12] River: I understand that nervousness, Alex! It helps to rehearse a lot.
[Message 13] David: Rehearsing definitely helps. Pretend your audience is just...rocks.
[Message 14] Alex: Rocks, good one David! I'll try that. Thanks!
[Message 15] Jordan: David, you always have the best advice.
[Message 16] River: Rocks, haha! I might borrow that one, David.
[Message 17] David: Use it wisely, River. So, anyone hungry? I brought some skewers.
[Message 18] Alex: Skewers sound amazing! I'm starving.
[Message 19] Jordan: I could definitely go for a skewer or two.
[Message 20] River: Skewers sound perfect! I'm in.
[Message 21] David: Excellent. I'll get them grilling. Jordan, do you know where I set up the grill? Near the picnic table?
[Message 22] Jordan: Yeah, David. It's right next to the picnic table, near the big oak tree.
[Message 23] David: Perfect, thanks Jordan! Be right back.
[Message 24] Alex: Anyone bring any good drinks?
[Message 25] River: I brought some sparkling cider!
[Message 26] Jordan: I've got some lemonade in the cooler.
[Message 27] Alex: Cider and lemonade, perfect mix!
[Message 28] David: (From near the grill) Lemonade sounds great, Jordan!
[Message 29] River: So, Alex, what kind of presentation is it?
[Message 30] Alex: It's about a new marketing campaign. Lots of pressure to impress.
[Message 31] Jordan: Marketing, huh? That's a tough field.
[Message 32] River: Marketing is all about creativity and strategy, right?
[Message 33] Alex: Exactly River! Trying to balance both is the challenge.
[Message 34] David: (Walking back with skewers) Alright, skewers are almost ready! Just need a few more minutes.
[Message 35] Jordan: They smell delicious already, David!
[Message 36] River: They look amazing! You're a grilling pro, David.
[Message 37] Alex: Smells fantastic David! Thanks for cooking.
[Message 38] David: My pleasure! Just glad everyone's enjoying the evening.
[Message 39] Jordan: This is exactly what I needed after a long week.
[Message 40] River: Totally agree, Jordan. This is perfect.
[Message 41] Alex: Agreed! So relaxing.
[Message 42] David: What kind of construction do you do, Jordan?
[Message 43] Jordan: Mostly residential. Building houses, renovating. It's hard work, but satisfying.
[Message 44] River: I bet it is! Seeing something you built come to life must be rewarding.
[Message 45] Alex: That sounds so cool Jordan! I admire people who work in construction.
[Message 46] David: Yeah, that's a tangible accomplishment. I just fill prescriptions, not quite the same.
[Message 47] Jordan: Your work is important too, David! People rely on you to get their medicine.
[Message 48] River: Absolutely, David! Your work makes a real difference in people's lives.
[Message 49] Alex: Agreed! Healthcare is essential David.
[Message 50] David: Thanks, guys. I appreciate that. Sometimes it just feels...routine.
[Message 51] Jordan: Everything can feel routine sometimes. You just have to find the joy in the little things.
[Message 52] River: That's a great point, Jordan. Finding joy in the everyday.
[Message 53] Alex: Exactly! It's the small victories that matter.
[Message 54] David: I suppose you're right. The little things. Like a beautiful sunset and good company.
[Message 55] Jordan: Exactly!
[Message 56] River: Precisely!
[Message 57] Alex: Yup!
[Message 58] David: Okay, skewers are officially ready! Let's eat!
[Message 59] Alex: Yay!
[Message 60] Jordan: Finally!
[Message 61] River: Wonderful!
[Message 62] David: I'll grab the plates. River, can you pass the lemonade?
[Message 63] River: Sure thing, David! Coming right up.
[Message 64] Jordan: (Grabbing a skewer) Mmm, these are delicious, David!
[Message 65] Alex: Seriously good David! What kind of marinade did you use?
[Message 66] River: These are fantastic! I need the recipe, David.
[Message 67] David: It's a secret family recipe! Just kidding. It's mostly soy sauce, honey, and ginger.
[Message 68] Alex: Simple but delicious!
[Message 69] Jordan: I'm definitely going to try making these at home.
[Message 70] River: Me too! Thanks for sharing, David.
[Message 71] David: No problem! Glad you all like them. So, River, any interesting challenges with the housing development?
[Message 72] River: Oh, plenty! Getting all the permits approved is a nightmare.
[Message 73] Alex: Ugh, permits are the worst! Red tape city.
[Message 74] Jordan: Tell me about it! Dealing with inspections is always a pain.
[Message 75] David: Sounds like a headache. Bureaucracy at its finest.
[Message 76] River: Exactly! But hopefully, once it's all approved, it'll be smooth sailing.
[Message 77] Alex: Fingers crossed for you, River!
[Message 78] Jordan: I'm sure it will be amazing once it's finished.
[Message 79] David: Agreed! Just gotta get through the red tape first.
[Message 80] River: Thanks, guys! I appreciate the support.
[Message 81] Alex: So, Jordan, what's the craziest thing you've seen on a construction site?
[Message 82] Jordan: Oh man, where do I even start? I once saw a raccoon steal a worker's lunch right out of his bag!
[Message 83] River: Haha! That's hilarious!
[Message 84] David: A raccoon bandit! That's great.
[Message 85] Alex: That's amazing! Animals are so bold.
[Message 86] Jordan: It was pretty funny. The guy was so mad, but what could he do?
[Message 87] River: Definitely a story to tell!
[Message 88] David: Reminds me of the time a squirrel stole my sandwich in the park.
[Message 89] Alex: Squirrels are notorious!
[Message 90] Jordan: It's always the food they go for!
[Message 91] River: They have good taste, I guess!
[Message 92] David: Apparently! More skewers, anyone?
[Message 93] Alex: Yes please!
[Message 94] Jordan: I'll take another one!
[Message 95] River: Me too!
[Message 96] David: Alright, coming right up. Anyone want to play cards after this?
[Message 97] Alex: Cards sound fun! I'm in.
[Message 98] Jordan: I'm terrible at cards, but I'll play anyway.
[Message 99] River: I'm up for cards! What should we play?
[Message 100] David: I was thinking poker? Or maybe something simpler like Go Fish?
[Message 101] Alex: Poker sounds good!
[Message 102] Jordan: Poker is too complicated for me. Go Fish!
[Message 103] River: I'm happy with either. Let's vote!
[Message 104] David: Okay, votes for Poker: Alex. Votes for Go Fish: Jordan. River?
[Message 105] River: I'll go with Go Fish to keep it simple and fun!
[Message 106] David: Alright, Go Fish it is! After we finish eating, then.
[Message 107] Alex: Go Fish it is! I can handle that.
[Message 108] Jordan: Yay!
[Message 109] River: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 110] David: Perfect. More food, then cards. This is a good night.
[Message 111] Alex: Totally! So glad we did this.
[Message 112] Jordan: Me too. Needed this.
[Message 113] River: Absolutely. Best way to end the week.
[Message 114] David: Anyone thinking about dessert? I brought some cookies.
[Message 115] Alex: Cookies! Always!
[Message 116] Jordan: I'm in!
[Message 117] River: Cookies sound amazing!
[Message 118] David: Alright, I'll get them out after we finish the skewers. They're chocolate chip.
[Message 119] Alex: Ooh, my favorite!
[Message 120] Jordan: Perfect!
[Message 121] River: Wonderful!
[Message 122] David: So, Alex, back to your presentation...any specific parts you're worried about?
[Message 123] Alex: Just trying to keep it engaging. Marketing presentations can be so dry.
[Message 124] Jordan: Maybe add some humor? People always appreciate a good laugh.
[Message 125] River: Humor can definitely help! But keep it relevant.
[Message 126] David: A little self-deprecating humor can go a long way.
[Message 127] Alex: Good point! I'll try to work some in. Thanks for the advice!
[Message 128] Jordan: No problem! We're here to help.
[Message 129] River: Exactly!
[Message 130] David: Definitely. We all need a little help sometimes.
[Message 131] Alex: True! Especially with presentations.
[Message 132] Jordan: Or building houses.
[Message 133] River: Or dealing with permits.
[Message 134] David: Or filling prescriptions. It all adds up.
[Message 135] Alex: Exactly! Teamwork makes the dream work!
[Message 136] Jordan: Absolutely!
[Message 137] River: Cheers to that!
[Message 138] David: Cheers! Alright, skewers are officially gone. Who's ready for cookies?
[Message 139] Alex: Me! Me!
[Message 140] Jordan: Bring on the cookies!
[Message 141] River: Cookie time!
[Message 142] David: Coming right up! These are fresh from the bakery.
[Message 143] Alex: Even better!
[Message 144] Jordan: Yum!
[Message 145] River: Perfect ending to the meal!
[Message 146] David: So, after cookies, Go Fish?
[Message 147] Alex: Yup!
[Message 148] Jordan: Let's do it!
[Message 149] River: Sounds great!
[Message 150] David: Excellent. This has been a great evening.
[Message 151] Alex: Agreed! Thanks for organizing, David!
[Message 152] Jordan: Yeah, thanks David!
[Message 153] River: Thank you, David! This was wonderful.
[Message 154] David: My pleasure, everyone. Let's do this again soon.
[Message 155] Alex: Definitely!
[Message 156] Jordan: Absolutely!
[Message 157] River: For sure!
[Message 158] David: Alright, let me grab the cards and we'll get this Go Fish game started!

[Message 40] Jordan: ""I never even downloaded it.""
[Message 41] Sam: ""Threads? Sounds like something to do with sewing.""

[Message 43] Jamie: ""Speaking of Twitter, that place is a dumpster fire.""
[Message 44] Riley: ""Agreed. I barely go on there anymore.""
[Message 45] Jordan: ""I use it for news, but that's about it.""

[Message 67] Riley: ""Fingers crossed it's a quick fix.""
[Message 68] Sam: ""Cars, am I right? Always something.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Seriously. I'm thinking of just getting a bike.""
[Message 70] Jamie: ""A bike in Fort Wayne? You're brave.""
[Message 71] Riley: ""Yeah, the traffic can be brutal.""
[Message 72] Sam: ""Good exercise, though.""

[Message 2] Jordan: Definitely! Starving. What's good here?
[Message 3] Sam: Heard their breakfast burrito is amazing, Jordan.
[Message 4] Jordan: Ooh, burrito sounds good!
[Message 5] Alex: I'm thinking the pancakes. Gotta fuel up for all this goal-setting!
[Message 6] Sam: Goals, huh? Feels a little early in the day for existential pondering.
[Message 7] Alex: Haha, fair. But I figured it'd be good to have a quick check-in.
[Message 8] Jordan: I'm in. My goal is to finish this massive burrito.
[Message 9] Alex: Attainable! I like it.
[Message 10] Sam: Alright, alright. What kinda goals are we talking? Work? Personal?
[Message 11] Alex: Anything and everything! What's been on your mind lately?
[Message 12] Jordan: Okay, so beyond the burrito, I'm aiming to run a 5k by the end of the summer.
[Message 13] Alex: Awesome! That's a great goal, Jordan.
[Message 14] Sam: Nice! I admire the fitness dedication.
[Message 15] Jordan: Thanks! It's been tough getting motivated.
[Message 16] Alex: I get that. Motivation ebbs and flows.
[Message 17] Sam: Speaking of motivation, this place has surprisingly good lighting.
[Message 18] Jordan: Haha, you're right, Sam! Perfect for selfies. Distraction averted.
[Message 19] Alex: Back to goals... Sam, anything you're working towards?
[Message 20] Sam: I'm actually thinking about redecorating my living room. It's been the same for, like, a decade.
[Message 21] Alex: Ooh, fun! What kind of vibe are you going for?
[Message 22] Jordan: Modern? Rustic? Shabby chic?
[Message 23] Sam: I'm leaning towards something a little more modern, maybe with some pops of color.
[Message 24] Alex: That sounds amazing. Pinterest is your friend!
[Message 25] Jordan: Totally agree! And Instagram.
[Message 26] Sam: True! Good point. I keep forgetting about Instagram.
[Message 27] Alex: Okay, my turn. I'm trying to get better at saying ""no"" to extra projects at work.
[Message 28] Jordan: Oh man, I feel that. Boundary setting is hard.
[Message 29] Sam: Especially when you're good at what you do! People always want your help.
[Message 30] Alex: Exactly! But I'm burning out. So, ""no"" is my word for the summer.
[Message 31] Jordan: I salute that goal!
[Message 32] Sam: Hear, hear! To saying no!
[Message 33] Alex: Thanks, guys. Appreciate the support.
[Message 34] Jordan: So, are we ordering more food? My burrito is vanishing quickly.
[Message 35] Sam: I could probably handle another coffee.
[Message 36] Alex: I'm good for now. Maybe we can order a little something sweet later?
[Message 37] Jordan: Always room for dessert!
[Message 38] Sam: Speaking of dessert, did you guys see that new bakery that opened up downtown?
[Message 39] Alex: No, tell me more!
[Message 40] Sam: Apparently, they have these incredible macarons.
[Message 41] Jordan: Macarons? I'm in! We should go after brunch.
[Message 42] Alex: I'm game. Macarons sound way better than more goal talk.
[Message 43] Sam: Agreed!
[Message 44] Jordan: Okay, shifting gears back to goals... anyone have any travel plans this year?
[Message 45] Alex: I'm hoping to go camping in Yosemite.
[Message 46] Sam: Ooh, beautiful! I haven't been in years.
[Message 47] Jordan: I'm thinking of visiting my sister in Seattle.
[Message 48] Alex: Seattle's great! Have you been before?
[Message 49] Jordan: A few times, but it's always fun to see her and the kids.
[Message 50] Sam: Family time is the best.
[Message 51] Alex: Totally agree.
[Message 52] Jordan: So, back to Sam's living room redecorating... any specific color schemes in mind?
[Message 53] Sam: I'm thinking maybe some blues and grays, with a pop of yellow.
[Message 54] Alex: That sounds really sophisticated.
[Message 55] Jordan: Definitely! Very calming.
[Message 56] Sam: That's the idea! I want it to be a relaxing space.
[Message 57] Alex: I get that. My apartment is my sanctuary.
[Message 58] Jordan: Mine too! Especially after a long day of physical therapy.
[Message 59] Sam: I can only imagine!
[Message 60] Alex: Okay, last round of goal talk before we get those macarons. Anyone have any small, achievable goals for this week?
[Message 61] Jordan: I want to meditate for 10 minutes every day.
[Message 62] Sam: I want to try a new recipe.
[Message 63] Alex: I want to read for 30 minutes before bed each night.
[Message 64] Jordan: Nice! We're all about self-care this week.
[Message 65] Sam: Absolutely!
[Message 66] Alex: Speaking of self-care, this coffee is amazing.
[Message 67] Jordan: Right? I needed this.
[Message 68] Sam: Definitely a good start to the day.
[Message 69] Alex: So, macarons after this?
[Message 70] Jordan: Macarons it is!
[Message 71] Sam: Lead the way!
[Message 72] Alex: Anyone see that article about the local elections?
[Message 73] Jordan: Oh yeah, I skimmed it. Seems like some interesting changes are coming.
[Message 74] Sam: I need to read it more closely.
[Message 75] Alex: Same. It's important to stay informed.
[Message 76] Jordan: Definitely. Especially with everything that's going on.
[Message 77] Sam: Okay, political discussion averted! Macarons!
[Message 78] Alex: Haha, good call!
[Message 79] Jordan: Let's do this!
[Message 80] Sam: I'm already picturing the rainbow of colors.
[Message 81] Alex: Me too!
[Message 82] Jordan: Okay, new goal: try every flavor of macaron.
[Message 83] Sam: Now that's a goal I can get behind!
[Message 84] Alex: Challenge accepted!
[Message 85] Jordan: Alright, let's pay and head out!
[Message 86] Sam: Sounds good!
[Message 87] Alex: Ready when you are!
[Message 88] Jordan: Okay, I'm getting the check.

503,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone, anyone thinking about doing any home improvement projects soon? I'm feeling the itch to finally repaint the living room.
[Message 2] River: Hey Alex! Funny you should mention that. I've been pondering new kitchen backsplash for weeks.
[Message 3] Sam: Oh, repainting is always a good idea. Adds a fresh feel. I'm dreading having to clean the gutters this fall.
[Message 4] Alex: Gutters, ugh. I always put that off as long as possible. River, what kind of backsplash are you thinking?
[Message 5] River: Something with a bit of color, maybe a mosaic tile? I'm torn between vibrant and something more subtle.
[Message 6] Sam: Mosaic sounds nice. I’ve been listening to this incredible new album by… oh, sorry, wrong chat. Backsplash, right!
[Message 7] Alex: Haha, no worries, Sam. Spill the album info later! Mosaic is definitely a good option, River. Have you checked out any stores around here?
[Message 8] River: I peeked at Home Depot, but nothing really jumped out at me. Maybe I should try Lowe's?
[Message 9] Sam: Lowe's has a decent selection, I think. Are you thinking of doing it yourself, River?
[Message 10] River: Yeah, I'm hoping to DIY it. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos. Seems manageable... I hope!
[Message 11] Alex: YouTube is your friend! I did a minor plumbing repair thanks to YouTube. Saved me a fortune.
[Message 12] Sam: Plumbing? Brave! I'd rather hire someone for that. Repainting, though, I’m all in.
[Message 13] Alex: I was terrified, but it worked out. Speaking of jobs, I have a job interview next week. Wish me luck!
[Message 14] River: Good luck, Alex! What kind of job?
[Message 15] Sam: Break a leg, Alex! You'll ace it.
[Message 16] Alex: Thanks, guys! It's a project manager position at a construction firm.
[Message 17] River: Ooh, that sounds interesting. Back to backsplash… Maybe I should look online?
[Message 18] Sam: Online could be good! More variety, probably. Just check reviews carefully.
[Message 19] Alex: Definitely check reviews. And measure twice, cut once!
[Message 20] River: Wise words, Alex. Alright, online backsplash search it is!
[Message 21] Sam: Let me know if you find anything cool. I'm always browsing for future projects.
[Message 22] Alex: Same here. I'm already dreaming of a new bathroom.
[Message 23] River: A new bathroom? Now you're talking! That's a big project, though.
[Message 24] Sam: Very big. Lots of planning involved. Did you say bathroom, Alex? What kind of style are you envisioning?
[Message 25] Alex: Something modern, with clean lines. Maybe a walk-in shower.
[Message 26] River: Ooh, fancy! I love walk-in showers.
[Message 27] Sam: Walk-in showers are the best. Practical and stylish. Have you looked at tile options for that too?
[Message 28] Alex: I’ve been pinning ideas on Pinterest like crazy! There are so many options.
[Message 29] River: Pinterest is a dangerous place. So many good ideas, so little time (and money!).
[Message 30] Sam: Tell me about it! I have boards for everything. Garden, furniture, you name it.
[Message 31] Alex: Same! It's a great source of inspiration, though.
[Message 32] River: True. Alright, I'm diving into the world of online tile. Wish me luck!
[Message 33] Sam: Good luck! I'm going to go put on that album I mentioned earlier.
[Message 34] Alex: Enjoy the music, Sam! And River, send us pics of your backsplash progress!
[Message 35] River: Will do! Talk soon.
[Message 36] Sam: Catch you later!
[Message 37] Alex: Later!
[Message 38] Alex: Hey, River, any luck with the online tile search?
[Message 39] River: Hey Alex! Found a few contenders! Nothing I'm completely sold on yet, though.
[Message 40] Sam: (Texting from the other room) What album are you listening to, Sam? You didn't say!
[Message 41] Sam: Sorry! Distracted by the music. It's called ""Aurora Sounds"" by Lunar Echoes. Really chill.
[Message 42] Alex: Lunar Echoes, I’ll have to check them out.
[Message 43] River: I might give them a listen too while I browse more tiles.
[Message 44] Alex: So, what are the contenders looking like, River? Any particular style catching your eye?
[Message 45] River: I'm leaning towards something with a subtle pattern, maybe a geometric design in muted tones.
[Message 46] Sam: Muted tones sound classy.
[Message 47] Alex: That sounds lovely. Not too overwhelming.
[Message 48] River: Exactly! I don't want it to clash with my countertops.
[Message 49] Sam: Smart move. Coordinating is key.
[Message 50] Alex: Absolutely. Have you considered the grout color yet? That can make a big difference.
[Message 51] River: Oh gosh, I haven't even thought about grout! More research needed.
[Message 52] Sam: Grout color is surprisingly important.
[Message 53] Alex: Definitely look at some examples online. Different grout colors can completely change the look of the tile.
[Message 54] River: Okay, grout research is now on the agenda. Thanks for the heads up!
[Message 55] Sam: Anytime! Happy to help.
[Message 56] Alex: Good luck with the grout rabbit hole!
[Message 57] River: Haha, thanks! I have a feeling I'll be lost in grout swatches for hours.
[Message 58] Sam: Just don't get overwhelmed! Take breaks.
[Message 59] Alex: Definitely take breaks! And maybe listen to some more Lunar Echoes.
[Message 60] River: Good idea! I'm putting them on now.
[Message 61] Sam: Excellent choice! Let me know what you think.
[Message 62] Alex: Speaking of choices, I need to start thinking about my outfit for the interview.
[Message 63] River: Oh yeah! That's coming up soon, right?
[Message 64] Sam: The interview! What are you thinking of wearing, Alex?
[Message 65] Alex: I was thinking a blazer and dress pants. Professional but not too stuffy.
[Message 66] River: Sounds like a good plan! A nice, solid color.
[Message 67] Sam: Definitely a solid color. And make sure your shoes are comfortable.
[Message 68] Alex: Good point about the shoes. I'll choose something I can stand in for a while.
[Message 69] River: And practice your answers to common interview questions!
[Message 70] Sam: Yes! Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse!
[Message 71] Alex: I've been doing some practice runs with a friend. It's helping a lot.
[Message 72] River: That's a great idea!
[Message 73] Sam: Super helpful to get feedback.
[Message 74] Alex: Definitely. I'm feeling a bit more confident now.
[Message 75] River: You got this, Alex!
[Message 76] Sam: You're going to rock it!
[Message 77] Alex: Thanks, guys! I appreciate the support.
[Message 78] River: Anytime! Let us know how it goes!
[Message 79] Sam: Absolutely! Keep us posted.
[Message 80] Alex: Will do! Back to you, River, any grout color ideas yet?
[Message 81] River: I'm thinking maybe a light gray? Something that blends in but doesn't disappear completely.
[Message 82] Sam: Light gray is a classic choice.
[Message 83] Alex: Very versatile. Works with pretty much anything.
[Message 84] River: That's what I'm hoping for. I don't want to regret my grout choice later!
[Message 85] Sam: Regret is the worst!
[Message 86] Alex: Especially with home improvement projects. They're such a commitment.
[Message 87] River: Tell me about it! That's why I'm overthinking everything.
[Message 88] Sam: It's better to overthink than to rush and make a mistake.
[Message 89] Alex: Exactly. Planning is key.
[Message 90] River: Okay, I'm feeling a bit better about the grout situation now. Thanks for the reassurance!
[Message 91] Sam: You got this, River!
[Message 92] Alex: You're doing great!
[Message 93] River: Thanks, guys! I might actually get this backsplash done after all.
[Message 94] Sam: I have faith in you!
[Message 95] Alex: Me too! Can't wait to see the finished product.
[Message 96] River: I'll definitely send pictures! Now, back to the Lunar Echoes… this music is seriously relaxing.
[Message 97] Sam: Told ya!
[Message 98] Alex: I'm going to put them on now too.
[Message 99] River: Let me know what you think, Alex!
[Message 100] Alex: Will do! Okay, switching over to music now. Talk later!
[Message 101] River: Later!
[Message 102] Sam: Have a good one!
[Message 103] Alex: (Later that evening) Okay, I listened to Lunar Echoes. Very chill indeed, Sam! Thanks for the recommendation.
[Message 104] Sam: Glad you liked it!
[Message 105] River: What did you think, Alex?
[Message 106] Alex: Perfect background music for reading or relaxing. I could see myself listening to that while painting.
[Message 107] River: Excellent! Multi-tasking music.
[Message 108] Sam: Exactly!
[Message 109] Alex: So, River, have you made a final decision on the backsplash tile?
[Message 110] River: Not quite yet. I'm still torn between two options.
[Message 111] Sam: Oh, the suspense!
[Message 112] Alex: What are the two contenders?
[Message 113] River: One is a light gray geometric pattern, and the other is a slightly warmer, off-white with a subtle texture.
[Message 114] Sam: Hmm, tough choice.
[Message 115] Alex: What color are your countertops?
[Message 116] River: They're a dark granite, with some lighter veining.
[Message 117] Sam: In that case, the lighter option might brighten up the space more.
[Message 118] Alex: I agree. The lighter one would provide more contrast.
[Message 119] River: That's what I was thinking too. Okay, you guys are swaying me towards the lighter option!
[Message 120] Sam: Go with your gut!
[Message 121] Alex: Trust your instincts!
[Message 122] River: Alright, I think I'm ready to commit! Wish me luck!
[Message 123] Sam: Good luck! You got this!
[Message 124] Alex: Go for it! Can't wait to see it!
[Message 125] River: Okay, ordering it now! Fingers crossed!
[Message 126] Sam: Let us know when it arrives!
[Message 127] Alex: Definitely! We need progress pics!
[Message 128] River: Will do! Thanks for all the help, guys! I really appreciate it.
[Message 129] Sam: Anytime, River!
[Message 130] Alex: Happy to help! Now, I should probably go practice my interview answers some more.
[Message 131] River: Good luck with that, Alex!
[Message 132] Sam: You'll nail it!
[Message 133] Alex: Thanks! Talk soon!
[Message 134] River: Later!

[Message 9] Alex: Smiling on the way to ruin people's lives with his sentencing lol. Jk jk… kinda.

[Message 10] Chloe: Alex! That's a terrible thing to say, even as a joke.

[Message 12] Ben: True. But still…dead is dead.

[Message 15] Ben: I heard someone saw a Transgender Male running away from the scene.

[Message 16] Alex: Wow, Ben, that's quite a specific detail. Where’d you hear that?

[Message 17] Ben: One of my neighbors is a cop.

[Message 18] David: A Transgender Male? That’s… strange.

[Message 35] Alex: Just some stuff for my garden.

[Message 36] Chloe: Ah, gotcha.

[Message 37] Ben: Did you guys see that Thompson had some pretty high profile cases recently?

[Message 38] David: Yeah, I think I read something about that. One was getting a lot of press.

[Message 39] Chloe: Maybe someone he sentenced wanted revenge.

[Message 40] Alex: Could be. People hold grudges.

[Message 2] Jamie: Yeah, crazy. I can't believe someone killed Dr. Aris.
[Message 3] Kai: I know, right? Poor thing. What a way to go.
[Message 4] Jamie: Seriously. I had an appointment with him next week. Now what am I gonna do about my filling?
[Message 5] Kai: Ugh, that sucks. Maybe try Dr. Lee down the street?
[Message 6] Jamie: Good idea. Anyway, cops think it was robbery gone wrong?
[Message 7] Kai: That's what I heard. But you know how Trenton PD is... probably just guessing.
[Message 8] Jamie: True. Still, scary to think it happened in broad daylight.
[Message 9] Kai: Tell me about it. Makes you wonder who's safe.
[Message 10] Jamie: Did you know Aris well?
[Message 11] Kai: Not really, just a patient. You?
[Message 12] Jamie: Same. Remember when you were talking about doing a project about social workers? Did you ever do it?
[Message 13] Kai: Nah, never got around to it. Too busy with work. You still volunteering at the shelter?
[Message 14] Jamie: Yep, every Saturday. Keeps me sane.
[Message 15] Kai: That's awesome. You're a good person, Jamie.
[Message 16] Jamie: Haha, thanks. So, back to the murder... anyone you think did it?
[Message 17] Kai: No clue. Could be anyone, honestly. Maybe a disgruntled patient?
[Message 18] Jamie: Maybe. Or someone Aris knew outside of work.
[Message 19] Kai: True. Did you see Elijah around lately?
[Message 20] Jamie: Elijah? No, not since that party last month. Why?
[Message 21] Kai: Just wondering. He always seemed a bit intense.
[Message 22] Jamie: He is. But I don't think he'd kill someone.
[Message 23] Kai: Hope not. So, you busy this weekend?
[Message 24] Jamie: Volunteering. What about you?
[Message 25] Kai: Working. Gotta pay the bills.
[Message 26] Jamie: Story of my life. Did you ever meet Asher?
[Message 27] Kai: Asher? The new intern at your office? No, why?
[Message 28] Jamie: He was asking a lot of weird questions about Aris' schedule yesterday.
[Message 29] Kai: Weird. Like what kind of questions?
[Message 30] Jamie: Just general stuff, but it felt off. Like he intended to be there at a specific time.
[Message 31] Kai: Could be nothing. Maybe he was just curious.
[Message 32] Jamie: Maybe. Still unsettling. He was looking up something about Impalement with a sharp object yesterday
[Message 33] Kai: Seriously? That's definitely weird. You should tell the police.
[Message 34] Jamie: I was thinking about it. Don't want to jump to conclusions, though.
[Message 35] Kai: Better safe than sorry. It's not like they're gonna arrest him just for asking questions.
[Message 36] Jamie: You're right. I will.
[Message 37] Kai: Good. So, anything else interesting happening?
[Message 38] Jamie: Not really. Just the usual drama at the shelter.
[Message 39] Kai: Always something.
[Message 40] Jamie: Did you ever find that book I lent you?
[Message 41] Kai: No, sorry! I'll look for it again this weekend.
[Message 42] Jamie: No worries, it's just been bugging me.
[Message 43] Kai: I understand. I hate losing things.
[Message 44] Jamie: Me too. Especially when they belong to someone else.
[Message 45] Kai: True. Hey, gotta run. Work is calling.
[Message 46] Jamie: Okay, talk to you later. Be safe!
[Message 47] Kai: You too!
[Message 48] Jamie: Hey, just wanted to let you know I told the cops about Asher.
[Message 49] Kai: Good for you. Hope it helps them find the killer.
[Message 50] Jamie: Me too. It's awful what happened to him.
[Message 51] Kai: Totally. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 52] Jamie: I hope so. So, you free for dinner next week?
[Message 53] Kai: Maybe. Let me check my schedule.
[Message 54] Jamie: Cool. Just let me know.
[Message 55] Kai: Will do.
[Message 56] Jamie: Hey, I forgot to ask, did Aris ever mention any enemies to you?
[Message 57] Kai: Nope. Never talked about his personal life. Just teeth.
[Message 58] Jamie: Okay. Just trying to piece things together.
[Message 59] Kai: I understand. Maybe the cops will find something.
[Message 60] Jamie: Yeah. Still creeps me out knowing it happened so close.
[Message 61] Kai: Tell me about it. Makes you think twice about going out alone.
[Message 62] Jamie: Exactly. Did you hear about the cult thing going around?
[Message 63] Kai: Cult? No, what's that about?
[Message 64] Jamie: Some people are saying it was a ritual killing. Elijah might be involved with them.
[Message 65] Kai: Seriously? That's wild. But is there any evidence?
[Message 66] Jamie: Not really, just rumors. But it's Trenton, so anything's possible.
[Message 67] Kai: True. Maybe Elijah was trying to gain control of a valuable asset.
[Message 68] Jamie: It is strange he left the office at Afternoon.
[Message 69] Kai: Definetly.
[Message 70] Jamie: Well, back to work. Gotta pretend to be productive.
[Message 71] Kai: Haha, same here. Talk soon.
[Message 72] Jamie: Later!
[Message 73] Kai: By the way, police searched Elijah's apartment.
[Message 74] Jamie: Oh wow. Anything come up?
[Message 75] Kai: Nothing concrete, but they took his computer.
[Message 76] Jamie: Figured. Hope they catch whoever did this soon.
[Message 77] Kai: Me too. It's messed up.
[Message 78] Jamie: Totally. Hey, something weird. Asher just texted me asking if I told the cops about him. How would he know?
[Message 79] Kai: That IS weird. Maybe someone overheard you? Or maybe he saw your message?
[Message 80] Jamie: True. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. But he did say he wanted to get rid of Dr. Aris.",1,
506,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey Jordan! How's it going? Just got out of a brutal meeting.
[Message 2] Jordan: Hey Alex! I'm good, just wrapping up some wiring at the Accounting firm. Early evening grind! You heading home?
[Message 3] Alex: Eventually. Thinking of hitting up that new bookstore, ""Pages & Ink,"" downtown first. Heard they have a great selection.
[Message 4] Jordan: Oh nice! I've been meaning to check that place out. I'm more of a finance book kind of person, you know?
[Message 5] Alex: Ha! Makes sense. Anything good you've read lately on that front?
[Message 6] Jordan: Actually, yeah. ""The Psychology of Money"" by Morgan Housel. Super insightful. Changed my perspective on investing.
[Message 7] Alex: Cool, I'll add it to my list. I’m more into current events and historical non-fiction myself. Just finished a biography of Eleanor Roosevelt.
[Message 8] Jordan: Eleanor Roosevelt! That's a classic. Did you know she used to visit the town I grew up in? Small world.
[Message 9] Alex: Wow, no kidding! That's pretty cool. Maybe it's a sign I should buy that book.
[Message 10] Jordan: Maybe! So, this new bookstore… what kind of stuff are *you* hoping to find?
[Message 11] Alex: Anything interesting, really. Maybe something on climate change, or a good investigative journalism piece. Something to make me think.
[Message 12] Jordan: Makes sense. I mostly listen to podcasts on those topics. Keeps my hands free while I'm working.
[Message 13] Alex: Podcasts are good. I’m just a sucker for the feel of a real book.
[Message 14] Jordan: I get that. There's something special about holding a physical book.
[Message 15] Alex: Exactly! Plus, less screen time is always a good thing.
[Message 16] Jordan: Agreed. Hey, random question… did you hear anything about that Project Manager position opening up at Johnson & Sons?
[Message 17] Alex: Oh yeah! My friend applied for that. It’s supposed to be a pretty competitive role.
[Message 18] Jordan: I figured. A friend of mine is also interviewing. Trying to get a feel for the competition, haha.
[Message 19] Alex: Haha, sneaky! Well, good luck to your friend. Hope they nail it.
[Message 20] Jordan: Thanks! I'll pass it on. Back to books... any particular authors you're into?
[Message 21] Alex: I like Erik Larson for non-fiction. And for fiction, I'm a big fan of Margaret Atwood.
[Message 22] Jordan: Atwood, nice! ""The Handmaid's Tale"" is intense.
[Message 23] Alex: Absolutely. Her writing is so powerful.
[Message 24] Jordan: You know, I actually had to read ""The Communist Manifesto"" for a class in college. It was... interesting.
[Message 25] Alex: Oh, wow. Quite the departure from finance books!
[Message 26] Jordan: Tell me about it! That was a long semester.
[Message 27] Alex: Haha, I can imagine. I had to read ""Moby Dick"" in high school. Still recovering.
[Message 28] Jordan: Moby Dick! Oh man, that sounds brutal. So many pages.
[Message 29] Alex: It was. But, you know, I appreciate it more now than I did then.
[Message 30] Jordan: That's how it always is, isn't it? You hate it at the time, but later you're like, ""Okay, I get it.""
[Message 31] Alex: Exactly. Anyway, I’m going to head out and try to beat the traffic. Pages & Ink, here I come!
[Message 32] Jordan: Have fun! Let me know if you find anything good.
[Message 33] Alex: Will do! Thanks, Jordan.
[Message 34] Jordan: No problem, Alex. Later!
[Message 35] Alex: Oh hey, before I go, you ever try that coffee shop, ""The Daily Grind,"" near your work?
[Message 36] Jordan: ""The Daily Grind""? Yeah, it's my go-to spot in the mornings. Best latte in Orlando, hands down.
[Message 37] Alex: Good to know! I'm always on the lookout for a new coffee place.
[Message 38] Jordan: Definitely check it out. Say hi to Maria behind the counter for me!
[Message 39] Alex: Will do! Okay, now I'm really leaving. Have a good evening!
[Message 40] Jordan: You too, Alex! Drive safe!
[Message 41] Alex: Just arrived at Pages & Ink. This place is HUGE.
[Message 42] Jordan: Whoa, really? I'm definitely adding it to my weekend plans.
[Message 43] Alex: Yeah, they have everything. Even a section for rare books.
[Message 44] Jordan: Rare books? That sounds fancy. Probably out of my budget.
[Message 45] Alex: Probably mine too! I'm sticking to the discounted section.
[Message 46] Jordan: Smart move. Anything catching your eye?
[Message 47] Alex: Found a book on the history of accounting! Kidding. Actually, a biography of Marie Curie.
[Message 48] Jordan: Marie Curie! Awesome. She was a total badass.
[Message 49] Alex: Right? And a book about the Irish potato famine. A bit depressing, but important.
[Message 50] Jordan: Heavy stuff. Balance it out with something lighter, maybe?
[Message 51] Alex: Good call. Maybe a funny memoir.
[Message 52] Jordan: Those are always good for a laugh. Anything on display that looks interesting?
[Message 53] Alex: They have a whole table dedicated to books about Orlando history.
[Message 54] Jordan: Orlando history? I never knew there was enough to fill a whole table!
[Message 55] Alex: Me neither! Apparently, Orlando used to be a huge citrus growing area.
[Message 56] Jordan: Huh. Learn something new every day.
[Message 57] Alex: Yep. Think I'm going to grab the Marie Curie book and maybe one of the Orlando history ones.
[Message 58] Jordan: Sounds like a good haul!
[Message 59] Alex: Yeah, I’m happy. Gonna check out now. How’s the wiring going?
[Message 60] Jordan: Almost done! Just a few more connections.
[Message 61] Alex: Awesome! Get some rest tonight.
[Message 62] Jordan: Will do. You too! Enjoy your new books.
[Message 63] Alex: Thanks! I’ll let you know what I think.
[Message 64] Jordan: Cool! Looking forward to it.
[Message 65] Alex: Okay, leaving now for real!
[Message 66] Jordan: Safe travels!
[Message 67] Alex: Made it home! The traffic was surprisingly light.
[Message 68] Jordan: Nice! Sometimes you get lucky.
[Message 69] Alex: True. Already started reading the Marie Curie book. It's captivating!
[Message 70] Jordan: Told ya! She's an amazing person.
[Message 71] Alex: Seriously. So much determination.
[Message 72] Jordan: Inspiring, right? Makes you want to achieve something great.
[Message 73] Alex: Definitely. Okay, back to reading! I'm hooked.
[Message 74] Jordan: Enjoy! I'm going to unwind with some Netflix.
[Message 75] Alex: Sounds good. What are you watching?
[Message 76] Jordan: ""Explained."" It's a documentary series on Netflix. Really informative.
[Message 77] Alex: I've heard of that! I'll have to check it out sometime.
[Message 78] Jordan: You should! They have an episode on money that you might find interesting.
[Message 79] Alex: Perfect! Thanks for the recommendation.
[Message 80] Jordan: No problem! Anytime.
[Message 81] Alex: Well, goodnight!
[Message 82] Jordan: Goodnight, Alex!
[Message 83] Alex: Oh, one last thing - did they ever finish the I-4 construction?
[Message 84] Jordan: Haha, good one. Pretty sure that's a lifelong project.
[Message 85] Alex: You're probably right. Night",0,
507,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Wow, what a wedding reception! Anyone else still buzzing from the dancing?""
[Message 2] Jordan: ""A little! More like buzzing from the sugar rush of that cake. So, real estate... Anyone thinking of buying or selling anytime soon?""
[Message 3] Riley: ""Potentially selling, Jordan. Thinking of downsizing. This old house is a lot to manage these days.""
[Message 4] Casey: ""Downsizing, huh? What area, Riley? Tulsa' got so many different vibes.""
[Message 5] Riley: ""Midtown. Been here for... well, let's just say a while. ""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Midtown is gorgeous! Always loved the architecture there.""
[Message 7] Jordan: ""Midtown's hot right now! Prices are pretty high, though. But you'd probably get a good return, Riley.""
[Message 8] Casey: ""Definitely get a good return. Have you thought about where you'd move to, Riley?""
[Message 9] Riley: ""Something smaller, maybe a condo downtown? Or perhaps something in Broken Arrow. Lower maintenance is the key.""
[Message 10] Alex: ""Downtown condos can be lovely! But HOA fees can be a killer.""
[Message 11] Jordan: ""True, HOA fees are something to seriously consider. Broken Arrow is nice, more spread out, though.""
[Message 12] Casey: ""Broken Arrow's great for families. Quieter. Though the commute to Tulsa can be a drag if you work here.""
[Message 13] Riley: ""I'm retired, Casey, so no commute to worry about anymore! Just looking for peace and quiet.""
[Message 14] Alex: ""Ah, retirement life! Sounds blissful. Did you see the bride's dress? Absolutely stunning.""
[Message 15] Jordan: ""It was gorgeous, Alex! But back to real estate... what's your budget looking like, Riley?""
[Message 16] Casey: ""Jordan, you're like a real estate agent in disguise!""
[Message 17] Jordan: ""Haha, I just find it interesting! Plus, my pharmacy is next to a real estate office, so I overhear a lot.""
[Message 18] Riley: ""Budget is flexible, Jordan. More interested in the right fit than the absolute cheapest option.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""That's a good approach, Riley. Better to be happy than house-poor.""
[Message 20] Casey: ""Definitely agree. Have you looked at any places online yet, Riley?""
[Message 21] Riley: ""I've browsed a bit, Casey. Zillow, Realtor.com... the usual suspects.""
[Message 22] Alex: ""Zillow's estimates can be… optimistic, let's say.""
[Message 23] Jordan: ""Very optimistic! Better to get a proper appraisal, Riley, when you're serious.""
[Message 24] Casey: ""Absolutely. And a good home inspection is crucial!""
[Message 25] Riley: ""Good point about the inspection, Casey. Wouldn't want any surprises.""
[Message 26] Alex: ""Speaking of surprises, did you try that weird shrimp appetizer? Total surprise… and not in a good way.""
[Message 27] Jordan: ""Ha! I avoided that one. Back to inspections… I know a good inspector if you need a recommendation, Riley.""
[Message 28] Casey: ""Me too! I have a guy who's incredibly thorough.""
[Message 29] Riley: ""Appreciate that, both of you. I'll keep those recommendations in mind.""
[Message 30] Alex: ""So, anyone else got any home improvement projects on their radar? My bathroom needs a serious overhaul.""
[Message 31] Jordan: ""Always something, isn't there? I'm thinking of redoing my garden this spring.""
[Message 32] Casey: ""I want to get new windows. My energy bill is outrageous.""
[Message 33] Riley: ""New windows are a great investment, Casey. Makes a big difference.""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Agreed! And they can really improve the curb appeal.""
[Message 35] Jordan: ""Curb appeal is key when selling, Riley! Something to consider.""
[Message 36] Casey: ""Definitely. A fresh coat of paint can work wonders too.""
[Message 37] Riley: ""I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the advice, everyone!""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Anytime, Riley! Happy to help.""
[Message 39] Jordan: ""So, Alex, that bathroom… thinking of DIY or hiring someone?""
[Message 40] Casey: ""Oh god, DIY bathroom remodel? That sounds like a nightmare.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Nightmare is right! Definitely hiring someone. I value my sanity.""
[Message 42] Jordan: ""Smart choice. I can recommend a good plumber if you need one.""
[Message 43] Casey: ""I've got a great tile guy! Let me know, Alex.""
[Message 44] Alex: ""You guys are the best! I'll definitely take you up on those recommendations.""
[Message 45] Riley: ""This is all making me think I need to start decluttering before I even think about listing the house.""
[Message 46] Jordan: ""Decluttering is essential, Riley! Makes a huge difference in how a place shows.""
[Message 47] Casey: ""Definitely! Get rid of anything you don't absolutely love or need.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""Marie Kondo is your friend, Riley!""
[Message 49] Riley: ""I've heard of her! Maybe I'll give her a try.""
[Message 50] Jordan: ""Seriously, it works! Plus, it feels good to get rid of stuff.""
[Message 51] Casey: ""It's liberating! And you can donate it all.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Or have a garage sale! Make a little extra cash.""
[Message 53] Riley: ""That's a thought! A garage sale would be fun.""
[Message 54] Jordan: ""And a good way to meet your neighbors!""
[Message 55] Casey: ""True! Okay, I'm officially inspired to declutter my own house now.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""Me too! Let's all have a decluttering party!""
[Message 57] Jordan: ""I'm in! We can all motivate each other.""
[Message 58] Riley: ""Sounds like a plan!""
[Message 59] Alex: ""So, back to real estate prices in Tulsa... are they still climbing?""
[Message 60] Jordan: ""They've plateaued a bit, I think. Not the crazy increase we saw last year.""
[Message 61] Casey: ""Yeah, it's starting to stabilize. Which is good, I think.""
[Message 62] Riley: ""Good for buyers, anyway.""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Definitely. Makes it a little less insane.""
[Message 64] Jordan: ""So, Riley, have you thought about talking to a real estate agent yet?""
[Message 65] Casey: ""That's a good idea. They can give you a realistic assessment of your home's value.""
[Message 66] Riley: ""I have a few in mind. My neighbor used one a while back and was happy.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""Word of mouth is always a good way to find a reliable agent.""
[Message 68] Jordan: ""Absolutely. Ask around, get some recommendations.""
[Message 69] Casey: ""And interview a few before you choose one.""
[Message 70] Riley: ""Good advice. I'll do that.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""So, anyone else feeling the post-wedding blues?""
[Message 72] Jordan: ""A little! It was such a beautiful day.""
[Message 73] Casey: ""Yeah, it was lovely. But I'm glad to be home in my pajamas.""
[Message 74] Riley: ""Me too! Getting old, I guess.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""Speak for yourself, Riley! You were tearing up the dance floor!""
[Message 76] Jordan: ""He was! Impressive moves.""
[Message 77] Casey: ""Definitely! You've got more energy than I do.""
[Message 78] Riley: ""Just trying to stay young at heart!""
[Message 79] Alex: ""Well, you're doing a great job of it!""
[Message 80] Jordan: ""So, anyone watching that new reality show about flipping houses?""
[Message 81] Casey: ""Oh god, those shows are so unrealistic.""
[Message 82] Alex: ""Totally! They make it look so easy.""
[Message 83] Riley: ""I can't imagine the stress of flipping a house.""
[Message 84] Jordan: ""It's definitely not for the faint of heart.""
[Message 85] Casey: ""And the budgets are always completely wrong.""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Exactly! It's all for the drama.""
[Message 87] Jordan: ""Still entertaining, though, in a guilty pleasure kind of way.""
[Message 88] Casey: ""True! I can't help but watch them.""
[Message 89] Riley: ""I'd rather watch a good movie.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""What kind of movies do you like, Riley?""
[Message 91] Jordan: ""Casey's the movie expert here!""
[Message 92] Casey: ""I do love a good movie! What genres do you enjoy, Riley?""
[Message 93] Riley: ""Classics mostly. Old Hollywood musicals, that sort of thing.""
[Message 94] Alex: ""Ah, a woman of taste!""
[Message 95] Jordan: ""Those are great! Timeless.""
[Message 96] Casey: ""I love those too! Have you seen 'Singin' in the Rain'?""
[Message 97] Riley: ""Of course! One of my favorites.""
[Message 98] Alex: ""A true masterpiece!""
[Message 99] Jordan: ""Alright, I'm officially adding that to my watchlist.""
[Message 100] Casey: ""You won't regret it! It's pure joy.""
[Message 101] Riley: ""So, back to real estate... anyone have any predictions for the Tulsa market in the next year?""
[Message 102] Alex: ""That's a tough one! So many factors at play.""
[Message 103] Jordan: ""I think it'll stay relatively stable, maybe a slight increase.""
[Message 104] Casey: ""I agree. Don't expect any huge swings.""
[Message 105] Riley: ""That's what I'm hoping for. Just want to make a sensible decision.""
[Message 106] Alex: ""Sensible is always a good idea.""
[Message 107] Jordan: ""Definitely. Don't get caught up in the hype.""
[Message 108] Casey: ""Do your research, and trust your gut.""
[Message 109] Riley: ""Will do! Thanks again for all the advice.""
[Message 110] Alex: ""Anytime, Riley! Good luck with the downsizing process.""
[Message 111] Jordan: ""Yes, good luck! Keep us updated.""
[Message 112] Casey: ""Definitely! We're here if you need anything.""
[Message 113] Riley: ""I appreciate that so much. You guys are the best.""
[Message 114] Alex: ""We try! Now, I'm officially starving again. That shrimp appetizer didn't cut it.""
[Message 115] Jordan: ""Haha! Me too. Pizza anyone?""
[Message 116] Casey: ""I'm in! What kind?""
[Message 117] Riley: ""I'm good, thanks. Too much cake already.""
[Message 118] Alex: ""Pepperoni and mushroom? Classic.""
[Message 119] Jordan: ""Sounds good to me! I'll order.""
[Message 120] Casey: ""Perfect! I'm craving some comfort food.""
[Message 121] Riley: ""Enjoy! I'm going to head to bed. Long day.""
[Message 122] Alex: ""Sleep well, Riley!""
[Message 123] Jordan: ""Goodnight, Riley!""
[Message 124] Casey: ""Night, Riley! Thanks for the real estate chat!""
[Message 125] Riley: ""Goodnight, everyone! And thank you all.""
[Message 126] Alex: ""Okay, pizza's on its way! So, Casey, what movies have you been watching lately?""
[Message 127] Jordan: ""Yeah, tell us! I need some recommendations.""
[Message 128] Casey: ""Well, I just saw that new horror movie... but maybe not for you, Jordan.""
[Message 129] Alex: ""Yeah, Jordan's more of a rom-com kinda guy.""
[Message 130] Jordan: ""Hey! I appreciate a good thriller too.""
[Message 131] Casey: ""Okay, okay! I also saw that indie drama that everyone's been talking about. It was really good, a bit slow though.""
[Message 132] Alex: ""Ooh, what's it called?""
[Message 133] Jordan: ""Yeah, spill!""
[Message 134] Casey: ""It's called 'The Quiet Hours'. Really thought-provoking.""
[Message 135] Alex: ""Sounds interesting! I'll check it out.""
[Message 136] Jordan: ""Me too! Always looking for something new.""
[Message 137] Casey: ""Alright, pizza's here! Movie night soon?""
[Message 138] Alex: ""Definitely! Let's plan it next week.""

[Message 7] Eleanor: ""Absolutely, Alex! Fine motor skills are crucial, and kneading dough is excellent for that. Plus, it’s a tasty reward!""
[Message 8] Beatrice: ""Speaking of rewards, I've heard dark chocolate is good for the heart. Anyone partake?""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Haha, Beatrice, always thinking of health benefits! I do enjoy a square of dark chocolate now and then. Moderation, of course.""
[Message 10] Eleanor: ""Moderation is key! Though, my weakness is a good slice of cake. Back to fitness, I've been trying to incorporate more strength training.""
[Message 11] Beatrice: ""Strength training is vital, especially as we get older. I use light weights. Keeps the bones strong.""
[Message 12] Alex: ""Yeah, I've been focusing more on bodyweight exercises. Easier on the joints, I find.""

[Message 23] Beatrice: ""Next week sounds agreeable. Weather permitting, of course.""
[Message 24] Alex: ""Definitely weather-dependent. We'll keep an eye on the forecast. What kind of fitness trackers do you guys use, if any?""
[Message 25] Eleanor: ""I have a simple Fitbit. Just tracks my steps and sleep.""
[Message 26] Beatrice: ""I don't use a tracker. I prefer to listen to my body. It usually tells me when I've had enough.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""That's a good point, Beatrice. Sometimes it's easy to get too caught up in the numbers. I have an Apple Watch, but I try not to obsess over it.""
[Message 28] Eleanor: ""I agree. It's about finding what works best for you and your body.""
[Message 29] Beatrice: ""Precisely. And enjoying the process!""
[Message 30] Alex: ""Definitely. I've been trying to find new ways to make exercise more enjoyable. Like listening to podcasts while I walk.""
[Message 31] Eleanor: ""That's a great idea, Alex! I often listen to audiobooks when I'm walking.""
[Message 32] Beatrice: ""Audiobooks are wonderful. I'm currently listening to a biography of Winston Churchill.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Wow, that sounds intense, Beatrice! I usually go for something lighter, like a comedy podcast.""
[Message 34] Eleanor: ""A good laugh is always beneficial! I'm a fan of historical fiction audiobooks myself.""
[Message 35] Beatrice: ""Historical fiction… interesting. I prefer the real thing.""
[Message 36] Alex: ""To each their own! Okay, back to fitness – any tips for staying motivated during the summer heat?""
[Message 37] Eleanor: ""Early morning walks or evening swims are my go-to. Avoiding the midday sun is crucial.""
[Message 38] Beatrice: ""Hydration is key. And a good hat!""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Definitely agree on the hydration. I've been trying to drink more water with electrolytes.""
[Message 40] Eleanor: ""Electrolytes are a good idea. Especially if you're sweating a lot.""
[Message 41] Beatrice: ""I prefer a glass of lemonade. Sweet and refreshing.""
[Message 42] Alex: ""Haha, Beatrice, you're such a classic! Lemonade is definitely refreshing. I've also been trying to find indoor fitness classes to escape the heat.""
[Message 43] Eleanor: ""That's a good plan, Alex. There are some great options at the community center.""
[Message 44] Beatrice: ""The community center… I haven't been there in years. Perhaps I should look into it.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""You definitely should, Beatrice! They have a lot of different activities.""
[Message 46] Eleanor: ""And it's a great way to socialize and meet new people.""
[Message 47] Beatrice: ""Socializing is important. Keeps the mind sharp.""
[Message 48] Alex: ""Exactly! So, are we all feeling inspired to step up our fitness game?""
[Message 49] Eleanor: ""I am! I think I'll try a new strength training exercise tomorrow.""
[Message 50] Beatrice: ""I'll aim for a longer walk in the garden.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""I'm going to try that walking in nature thing and see if I can actually remember where I parked.""
[Message 52] Eleanor: ""Haha! Good luck with that, Alex.""
[Message 53] Beatrice: ""Indeed. Memory is a fickle thing.""
[Message 54] Alex: ""Tell me about it! Speaking of, anyone have any good brain-boosting recipes?""
[Message 55] Eleanor: ""Walnuts are supposed to be good for the brain. I often add them to my baked goods.""
[Message 56] Beatrice: ""Walnuts, yes. And blueberries. Antioxidants are beneficial.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Blueberries, got it! I'll add them to my smoothie tomorrow. Thanks, guys!""
[Message 58] Eleanor: ""You're welcome, Alex! Now, about that park walk next week...""
[Message 59] Beatrice: ""Yes, we should decide on a day and time.""
[Message 60] Alex: ""How about Wednesday morning? It's usually less crowded then.""
[Message 61] Eleanor: ""Wednesday morning works for me.""
[Message 62] Beatrice: ""Wednesday morning… I'll check my schedule. But it sounds promising.""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Great! We'll tentatively plan for Wednesday, then. We can confirm closer to the date.""
[Message 64] Eleanor: ""Sounds perfect.""
[Message 65] Beatrice: ""Agreed.""
[Message 66] Alex: ""Alright, fitness plans in place! What about post-walk refreshments? Any preferences?""
[Message 67] Eleanor: ""A nice cup of tea would be lovely.""
[Message 68] Beatrice: ""Tea sounds delightful. Or perhaps a light snack.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Tea and a snack it is! I'll bring some fruit and maybe some homemade cookies (if Eleanor doesn't mind me stealing her baking inspiration!).""
[Message 70] Eleanor: ""Haha! Steal away, Alex! I'm happy to share my baking knowledge.""
[Message 71] Beatrice: ""Sharing is caring, as they say.""
[Message 72] Alex: ""Exactly! Well, I should probably head out soon. This embassy wait is killing me.""
[Message 73] Eleanor: ""I understand. It's been nice chatting with you both.""
[Message 74] Beatrice: ""Indeed. A pleasant distraction.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""Definitely. Let's keep in touch! And I'll text you guys about confirming the park walk.""
[Message 76] Eleanor: ""Sounds good, Alex! Have a good afternoon.""
[Message 77] Beatrice: ""Goodbye, Alex. Safe travels.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""Bye everyone!""
[Message 79] Eleanor: ""Well, Beatrice, now that Alex has left, I must admit, I'm intrigued by her fashion sense.""
[Message 80] Beatrice: ""Alex has a certain flair, doesn't they? I admire their individuality.""
[Message 81] Eleanor: ""Indeed. It's refreshing to see someone express themselves so freely.""
[Message 82] Beatrice: ""I often wonder how fashion trends evolve. It's quite fascinating.""
[Message 83] Eleanor: ""It is! I remember when hemlines were all the rage. Now, it seems anything goes.""
[Message 84] Beatrice: ""Anything goes… perhaps that's a reflection of our times.""
[Message 85] Eleanor: ""Perhaps. On a completely unrelated note, did you see that article about the local rose garden getting a new variety?""
[Message 86] Beatrice: ""No, I didn't. Roses are my favorite. I must look into that.""
[Message 87] Eleanor: ""It's supposed to be a stunning new hybrid. I think it's called 'Sunset Blush'.""
[Message 88] Beatrice: ""'Sunset Blush'... a beautiful name. I'll have to pay the rose garden a visit soon.""
[Message 89] Eleanor: ""Maybe we could go together after our park walk?""
[Message 90] Beatrice: ""That's a wonderful idea, Eleanor! I'd enjoy that very much.""
[Message 91] Eleanor: ""Excellent! We'll add it to our agenda. Fitness, tea, snack, roses... a perfect day.""
[Message 92] Beatrice: ""Indeed. A well-rounded and enriching experience.""
[Message 93] Eleanor: ""Now, I'm feeling rather peckish. Perhaps I'll grab a small pastry from the cafe here.""
[Message 94] Beatrice: ""A pastry sounds tempting. I might join you.""
[Message 95] Eleanor: ""Wonderful! Shall we?""
[Message 96] Beatrice: ""Let's.""
[Message 97] Alex: ""Hey ladies, just a quick update. Park walk on Wednesday is a go, weather looks great! Confirm if you’re still in!""
[Message 98] Eleanor: ""Great news, Alex! I'm still in.""
[Message 99] Beatrice: ""Confirmed on my end as well.""
[Message 100] Alex: ""Awesome! See you both Wednesday morning, then!""
[Message 101] Eleanor: ""Looking forward to it, Alex!""
[Message 102] Beatrice: ""Until Wednesday.""
[Message 103] Alex: ""Oh, and I forgot to ask, any allergies I should be aware of for the snack?""
[Message 104] Eleanor: ""No allergies here.""
[Message 105] Beatrice: ""None for me either.""
[Message 106] Alex: ""Perfect! Cookies it is, then! Maybe a few different kinds.""
[Message 107] Eleanor: ""That sounds delightful, Alex! You're so thoughtful.""
[Message 108] Beatrice: ""Indeed. Your kindness is appreciated.""
[Message 109] Alex: ""Just trying to be a good host! Okay, back to waiting...""
[Message 110] Eleanor: ""Good luck, Alex! Hope the waiting doesn't take too long.""
[Message 111] Beatrice: ""Fingers crossed for a swift resolution.""
[Message 112] Alex: ""Thanks, guys! I appreciate it.""
[Message 113] Eleanor: ""Beatrice, did you ever find out if those new garden gnomes you ordered arrived?""
[Message 114] Beatrice: ""Ah, yes! They arrived yesterday. Quite charming, actually. One is fishing, the other is reading a book.""
[Message 115] Eleanor: ""How adorable! I can picture them perfectly in your garden.""
[Message 116] Beatrice: ""They add a touch of whimsy, I think.""
[Message 117] Eleanor: ""Definitely! A little bit of whimsy is good for the soul.""
[Message 118] Beatrice: ""I agree wholeheartedly.""
[Message 119] Eleanor: ""Speaking of soul, I saw a documentary about the benefits of meditation for mental well-being.""
[Message 120] Beatrice: ""Meditation is a practice I've always been curious about, but never quite pursued.""
[Message 121] Eleanor: ""It can be quite beneficial. I try to meditate for a few minutes each day.""
[Message 122] Beatrice: ""Perhaps I'll give it a try. Any tips for a beginner?""
[Message 123] Eleanor: ""Start small. Just a few minutes of quiet breathing. There are many guided meditation apps available.""
[Message 124] Beatrice: ""Guided meditation apps... I'll look into that. Thank you, Eleanor.""
[Message 125] Eleanor: ""You're welcome, Beatrice! It's all about finding what works for you.""
[Message 126] Beatrice: ""Precisely.""
[Message 127] Alex: ""Hey, still here... waiting... anyone know any good riddles to pass the time?""
[Message 128] Eleanor: ""Let me think... what has an eye, but cannot see?""
[Message 129] Beatrice: ""A needle!""
[Message 130] Alex: ""Correct! Nice one, Beatrice! Okay, my turn: What has to be broken before you can use it?""
[Message 131] Eleanor: ""An egg!""
[Message 132] Beatrice: ""Of course! Clever.""
[Message 133] Alex: ""You guys are too good! One more: What is full of holes but still holds water?""
[Message 134] Eleanor: ""Hmm... I'm stumped.""
[Message 135] Beatrice: ""A sponge!""
[Message 136] Alex: ""Bingo! You guys are riddle masters! Thanks for the distraction!""
[Message 137] Eleanor: ""You're welcome, Alex! Glad we could help pass the time.""
[Message 138] Beatrice: ""Indeed. A bit of mental exercise is always welcome.""
[Message 139] Alex: ""Definitely! Okay, back to the waiting game...""
[Message 140] Eleanor: ""Fingers crossed it's over soon!""
[Message 141] Beatrice: ""Indeed.""
[Message 142] Eleanor: ""Beatrice, have you started any new knitting projects lately?""
[Message 143] Beatrice: ""As a matter of fact, yes. I'm knitting a scarf for my grandson.""
[Message 144] Eleanor: ""How lovely! What color is it?""
[Message 145] Beatrice: ""A deep blue. His favorite.""
[Message 146] Eleanor: ""He'll love it! Homemade gifts are always so special.""
[Message 147] Beatrice: ""I agree. They come from the heart.""
[Message 148] Eleanor: ""Absolutely. I'm thinking of knitting some small blankets for the local animal shelter.""
[Message 149] Beatrice: ""That's a wonderful idea, Eleanor! They'll appreciate the warmth.""
[Message 150] Eleanor: ""I hope so. It's a small way to give back.""
[Message 151] Beatrice: ""Every little bit helps.""
[Message 152] Alex: ""Success! I'm finally done! On my way out now. See you both Wednesday!""
[Message 153] Eleanor: ""Wonderful news, Alex! See you Wednesday!""
[Message 154] Beatrice: ""Congratulations, Alex! Until then.""
[Message 155] Alex: ""Woohoo! Can't wait for that park walk now! Peace out!""
[Message 156] Eleanor: ""Goodbye, Alex!""
[Message 157] Beatrice: ""Farewell.""
[Message 158] Eleanor: ""Well, Beatrice, that was quite the wait for Alex, wasn't it?""
[Message 159] Beatrice: ""Indeed. But at least they're finally free.""
[Message 160] Eleanor: ""Yes. And we have a park walk to look forward to.""
[Message 161] Beatrice: ""Indeed. And roses.""
[Message 162] Eleanor: ""And tea and snacks.""
[Message 163] Beatrice: ""A truly delightful plan.""
[Message 164] Eleanor: ""I agree. Now, I think I will go check out that pastry.""
[Message 165] Beatrice: ""I'll join you. A small indulgence is in order.""
[Message 166] Eleanor: ""Excellent! Let's go.""
[Message 167] Alex: ""Hey! I forgot to ask, what time Wednesday are we thinking? Sorry to bother you again!""
[Message 168] Eleanor: ""No bother at all, Alex! How does 10 AM sound?""
[Message 169] Beatrice: ""10 AM works for me.""
[Message 170] Alex: ""Perfect! 10 AM it is! Thanks again!""
[Message 171] Eleanor: ""You're welcome, Alex! See you then.""
[Message 172] Beatrice: ""Until Wednesday.""
[Message 173] Alex: ""Okay, NOW I'm really leaving! haha""
[Message 174] Eleanor: ""Safe travels!""
[Message 175] Beatrice: ""Goodbye.""
[Message 176] Eleanor: ""Beatrice, I think I'll try the eclair. It looks divine.""
[Message 177] Beatrice: ""An eclair sounds tempting. I might opt for a small fruit tart.""
[Message 178] Eleanor: ""A lovely choice! Let's go indulge!""
[Message 179] Beatrice: ""Indeed. A well-deserved treat.""
[Message 180] Eleanor: ""Agreed! To pastries and park walks!""
[Message 181] Beatrice: ""To pastries and park walks! A toast, indeed!""
[Message 182] Eleanor: ""Now, which pastry to choose...""
[Message 183] Beatrice: ""The decisions, the decisions...""
[Message 184] Eleanor: ""Perhaps I'll get one of each! Just kidding... mostly.""

510,"[Message 1] Anya: Hey everyone! How's the Botanical Garden path treating you all?
[Message 2] Kai: Pretty good, Anya! Just enjoying the early evening. Anyone thinking of catching a show sometime?
[Message 3] Liam: I’m game, Kai! What kind of theatre are you thinking?
[Message 4] Sasha: Depends. Are we talking musical, drama, comedy? My vote's always for comedy.
[Message 5] River: Comedy sounds great. I'm in!
[Message 6] Anya: I'm more of a drama person myself, but I'm flexible. What's playing around here lately?
[Message 7] Kai: I saw an ad for ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" at the Riverside Playhouse. Always a classic.
[Message 8] Liam: Oh, I love Oscar Wilde! That could be fun.
[Message 9] Sasha: Earnest? Hmmm. I've seen it before, but I'm willing to revisit if everyone else is keen.
[Message 10] River: I've never actually seen it! Count me in!
[Message 11] Anya: Okay, ""Earnest"" sounds like a possibility. Any other suggestions? Maybe something a bit more… contemporary?
[Message 12] Kai: There's that new play at the community theatre, ""Echoes of Yesterday."" Reviews are mixed, though.
[Message 13] Liam: Mixed reviews are a red flag for me. Maybe we should stick with something we know is good?
[Message 14] Sasha: Agreed. Earnest it is, then?
[Message 15] River: Seems like it!
[Message 16] Anya: Alright, ""The Importance of Being Earnest."" Who's in charge of getting tickets?
[Message 17] Kai: I can check availability and pricing. Give me a few minutes.
[Message 18] Liam: Awesome, thanks Kai!
[Message 19] Sasha: While Kai does that, anyone have any exciting weekend plans?
[Message 20] River: Thinking of trying that new coffee shop downtown. ""The Daily Grind,"" I think it's called.
[Message 21] Anya: I've heard good things about that place! Let me know what you think. I need a new caffeine fix.
[Message 22] Liam: I’m trying to finish up a writing project. Wish me luck!
[Message 23] Sasha: Good luck, Liam! I’m just planning on relaxing, maybe binge-watching something.
[Message 24] Kai: Okay, so ""Earnest"" at the Riverside Playhouse has tickets available for next Saturday evening.
[Message 25] River: Perfect!
[Message 26] Anya: Saturday works for me.
[Message 27] Liam: Sounds good.
[Message 28] Sasha: Excellent!
[Message 29] Kai: Prices range from $25 to $40, depending on seating.
[Message 30] River: $25 sounds good to me!
[Message 31] Anya: I'd be willing to spend a bit more for a better view.
[Message 32] Liam: Same here.
[Message 33] Sasha: Let's aim for the $30-$35 range?
[Message 34] Kai: Okay, aiming for $30-$35 it is. I'll see what's available.
[Message 35] River: Great!
[Message 36] Anya: Thanks for organizing, Kai!
[Message 37] Liam: Yes, thank you!
[Message 38] Sasha: Appreciate it!
[Message 39] Kai: No problem! Just give me a few more minutes.
[Message 40] River: So, anyone got any fun facts about Oscar Wilde?
[Message 41] Anya: He was incredibly witty, obviously. And imprisoned for ""gross indecency,"" which was code for being gay.
[Message 42] Liam: Yeah, it was a really tragic story.
[Message 43] Sasha: His wit definitely shines through in his plays, though.
[Message 44] Kai: Okay, I've managed to snag five tickets in the $32 range. Not front row, but decent seats.
[Message 45] River: Awesome!
[Message 46] Anya: Perfect!
[Message 47] Liam: Fantastic!
[Message 48] Sasha: You're a lifesaver, Kai!
[Message 49] Kai: Great! How do you want to handle payment?
[Message 50] River: Venmo?
[Message 51] Anya: Venmo works for me too.

[Message 55] River: Got it!
[Message 56] Anya: Sent!
[Message 57] Liam: Paid!
[Message 58] Sasha: Done!
[Message 59] Kai: Awesome! Tickets secured! See you all next Saturday.
[Message 60] River: Can't wait!
[Message 61] Anya: Me neither!
[Message 62] Liam: Looking forward to it!
[Message 63] Sasha: Should be a fun night!
[Message 64] River: Hey Anya, you taking your camera? Maybe get some cool pre-show shots?
[Message 65] Anya: Good idea! I'll definitely bring it.
[Message 66] Liam: Speaking of, what's the dress code for the Playhouse?
[Message 67] Sasha: It's pretty casual. Smart casual, I'd say.
[Message 68] River: Jeans and a nice top should be fine, then?
[Message 69] Anya: Yeah, that's what I usually wear.
[Message 70] Liam: Sounds good. I'll aim for something similar.
[Message 71] Kai: As long as you're not wearing pajamas, you're good. Haha.
[Message 72] Sasha: Haha, true!
[Message 73] River: Okay, no PJs! Noted!
[Message 74] Anya: So, Saturday evening. Should we meet beforehand for dinner or drinks?
[Message 75] Liam: That sounds fun!
[Message 76] Sasha: I'm in!
[Message 77] River: Definitely!
[Message 78] Kai: Sure, why not?
[Message 79] Anya: Any restaurant suggestions near the Playhouse?
[Message 80] Liam: There's that Italian place, ""Bella Notte."" It's pretty good.
[Message 81] Sasha: Bella Notte is always a solid choice.
[Message 82] River: I've heard good things about their pasta.
[Message 83] Kai: Bella Notte sounds good to me. Let's aim for around 6 pm? The show starts at 7:30.
[Message 84] Anya: 6 pm at Bella Notte works perfectly.
[Message 85] Liam: See you all there!

[Message 93] Anya: Exactly! So, back to weekend plans… anyone travelling anywhere interesting soon?
[Message 94] Liam: I’m thinking of visiting my sister in San Francisco in a few months.
[Message 95] Sasha: Oh, San Francisco is lovely! I was there last year.
[Message 96] River: I've always wanted to go to San Francisco.
[Message 97] Kai: Maybe we should all plan a trip together sometime!
[Message 98] Anya: That would be amazing!
[Message 99] Liam: I'm definitely up for that!
[Message 100] Sasha: Count me in!
[Message 101] River: San Francisco? Or somewhere else?
[Message 102] Kai: We could brainstorm different destinations.
[Message 103] Anya: I’ve always wanted to see the Grand Canyon.
[Message 104] Liam: The Grand Canyon would be incredible!
[Message 105] Sasha: Ooh, good suggestion!
[Message 106] River: Okay, Grand Canyon is on the list!
[Message 107] Kai: We should start a separate chat for travel planning.

[Message 125] Sasha: And the costumes! I always love the costumes.
[Message 126] River: Me too! I always pay attention to the details.

[Message 139] Sasha: Should we think about what time of year would be best?
[Message 140] River: Good point!
[Message 141] Anya: That’s a great idea!

[Message 3] Alex: ""Just some old fishing gear to my nephew. He's getting into it now.""
[Message 4] Jamie: ""Cool! Did you tell him about the time you caught that enormous catfish?""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Oh, you know I did! That story gets told at every family dinner.""
[Message 6] Jamie: ""Haha, I bet! What's your funniest family dinner story *besides* the catfish?""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Hmm, that's a tough one. There are so many.""
[Message 8] Jamie: ""Give me your top three!""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Okay, okay. One, the time my sister brought a casserole with sugar instead of salt.""
[Message 10] Jamie: ""Oh no! How did that go over?""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Surprisingly well! Everyone was polite, but no one ate more than one bite.""
[Message 12] Jamie: ""Haha, classic Midwestern passive-aggressiveness.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Exactly! Two, the year the dog ate the turkey.""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""Seriously?! Oh my gosh!""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Yep! Right off the counter. We had to order pizza.""
[Message 16] Jamie: ""Okay, that's pretty epic. What's number three?""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Okay. My grandma tried to deep fry a block of cheese. It didn't end well.""
[Message 18] Jamie: ""A block of cheese?! What was she thinking?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""She said she saw it on Pinterest. Let that be a lesson, kids.""

[Message 22] Jamie: ""My little cousin, who was like, five, decided to give a 'speech' at Thanksgiving. He just stood on his chair and yelled about dinosaurs for ten minutes.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""That's amazing! Kids are the best.""
[Message 24] Jamie: ""It was pretty great. Then he demanded more mashed potatoes.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Of course! Mashed potatoes are the fuel of champions.""
[Message 26] Jamie: ""Exactly! Another one: my uncle wore a full suit of armor to Christmas dinner one year.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Wait, really? Why?""
[Message 28] Jamie: ""He's a medieval history buff. He said he wanted to be 'festive.'""
[Message 29] Alex: ""That's... dedicated. I respect it.""
[Message 30] Jamie: ""Right? It was so hot in the house, he was sweating buckets.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Oh man, that's rough.""
[Message 32] Jamie: ""Last one: my grandpa tried to carve the turkey with a butter knife.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""A butter knife?! Was he joking?""
[Message 34] Jamie: ""Nope. He was completely serious. He insisted it was 'sharp enough.'""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Some people are just stubborn like that.""
[Message 36] Jamie: ""Tell me about it! So, any big plans for the weekend?""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Thinking about hitting up Lake Arcadia for some fishing. You?""
[Message 38] Jamie: ""Probably just gonna stay in and work on a sculpture. Got a new project I'm excited about.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Ooh, what kind of sculpture?""
[Message 40] Jamie: ""I'm doing a bust of my cat, Mittens. She's not thrilled about posing.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Haha! Cats are not known for their cooperation.""
[Message 42] Jamie: ""No, they are definitely not. She keeps trying to eat the clay.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Well, that sounds like a fun challenge. Good luck with that!""
[Message 44] Jamie: ""Thanks! Maybe I'll send you a picture when it's done. Although, it might just look like a blob of clay.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""I'm sure it'll be great! You're talented.""
[Message 46] Jamie: ""Aw, thanks Alex! Appreciate it.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Anytime. Hey, gotta run. Got some errands to do.""
[Message 48] Jamie: ""No problem! Have a good one!""
[Message 49] Alex: ""You too! Talk to you later.""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""Later!""
[Message 51] Jamie: ""Oh hey, quick question - do you remember the name of that bait shop near Lake Arcadia you recommended last time?""
[Message 52] Alex: ""Let me think... I think it was called 'Bob's Bait & Tackle'.""
[Message 53] Jamie: ""Perfect, thanks! Just making a note of it for future reference.""

[Message 2] Liam: Yeah, crazy, right? Heard it on the news. Two people…
[Message 3] Chloe: So awful! Who were they?
[Message 4] Maya: I think one was a cop, name of Alex?
[Message 5] Liam: And the other?
[Message 6] Chloe: I heard it was someone named Jordan. So young.
[Message 7] David: Go-Kart Track? Seriously? What happened?
[Message 8] Maya: Murder, David! Apparently, they were pushed.
[Message 9] David: Pushed? From where? Sounds awful.
[Message 10] Liam: No idea, details are sketchy. Everyone's saying different things.
[Message 11] Chloe: I heard a rumor it was someone who used to work there.
[Message 12] Maya: You think it was someone with a grudge?
[Message 13] David: Maybe. People get fired all the time.
[Message 14] Liam: True, but murder? That's a big leap.
[Message 15] Chloe: Especially pushing someone! That's so… personal.
[Message 16] Maya: Yeah, you have to get right up close.
[Message 17] David: Anyone know Alex and Jordan?
[Message 18] Liam: I knew Alex a little. Seemed like a good person.
[Message 19] Chloe: Me too! Always smiling.
[Message 20] Maya: I only saw them around, never really talked.
[Message 21] David: What about Jordan?
[Message 22] Liam: Never met Jordan.
[Message 23] Chloe: Same here.
[Message 24] Maya: So messed up.
[Message 25] David: Definitely.
[Message 26] Liam: The cops will figure it out, right?
[Message 27] Chloe: Hope so.
[Message 28] Maya: They have to. For Alex and Jordan.
[Message 29] David: I heard some rumors.
[Message 30] Liam: About what?
[Message 31] David: That Alex was getting close to someone's partner.
[Message 32] Chloe: Wow, really?
[Message 33] Maya: Spicy! But still, doesn't justify this.
[Message 34] Liam: Exactly.
[Message 35] David: Just saying, could be a motive.
[Message 36] Chloe: Did anyone see anything strange that night? Early Evening?
[Message 37] Maya: I was at home, watching TV.
[Message 38] Liam: I was out of town.
[Message 39] David: I was… grabbing a late dinner.
[Message 40] Chloe: Where, David?
[Message 41] David: Just a local diner. Why?
[Message 42] Chloe: Just curious. This whole thing is making me paranoid.
[Message 43] Maya: Me too.
[Message 44] Liam: Seriously.
[Message 45] David: I get it.
[Message 46] Maya: I saw Sarah there earlier that day.
[Message 47] Liam: Sarah? Working?
[Message 48] Chloe: Sarah hasn't worked there for months.
[Message 49] Maya: I just remember seeing her around. But I could be wrong.
[Message 50] David: Maybe she was just visiting.
[Message 51] Liam: Yeah, could be.
[Message 52] Chloe: Still, weird.
[Message 53] Maya: I agree.
[Message 54] David: I'm sure it's nothing.
[Message 55] Liam: Let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 56] Chloe: True, true.
[Message 57] Maya: You guys think they'll find the person?
[Message 58] Liam: They have to.
[Message 59] David: It's Toledo, not exactly a hotbed of criminal masterminds.
[Message 60] Chloe: Rude, David!
[Message 61] Maya: Haha!
[Message 62] Liam: He's got a point though.
[Message 63] David: I'm just saying, someone is going to get a very long sentence for this.
[Message 64] Chloe: It's awful to think about.
[Message 65] Maya: Agreed.
[Message 66] Liam: This is going to haunt that place.
[Message 67] David: For sure.
[Message 68] Chloe: I feel bad for the owners.
[Message 69] Maya: Me too.
[Message 70] Liam: They must be devastated.
[Message 71] David: Anyone going to the vigil tomorrow?
[Message 72] Chloe: I am.
[Message 73] Maya: I think I will too.
[Message 74] Liam: I'm still out of town.
[Message 75] David: I'll be there.
[Message 76] Chloe: Good.
[Message 77] Maya: It's the least we can do.
[Message 78] Liam: Agreed.
[Message 79] David: We should all stick together.
[Message 80] Chloe: Definitely.
[Message 81] Maya: Yup.
[Message 82] Liam: For sure.
[Message 83] David: So, diner. Anyone want to go later?
[Message 84] Chloe: Sure, I'm in.
[Message 85] Maya: Me too.
[Message 86] Liam: Wish I could!
[Message 87] David: Next time, Liam.
[Message 88] Chloe: Yeah!
[Message 89] Maya: Totally.
[Message 90] Liam: I'll be there.
[Message 91] David: So, who do we think did it? Seriously?
[Message 92] Chloe: I have no idea.
[Message 93] Maya: Me neither.
[Message 94] Liam: It could be anyone.
[Message 95] David: But someone must have intended it.
[Message 96] Chloe: I guess so.
[Message 97] Maya: A horrible thing to intend.
[Message 98] Liam: True.
[Message 99] David: Well, see you guys later.
[Message 100] Chloe: Bye!
[Message 101] Maya: Later!
[Message 102] Liam: Peace out.

[Message 104] David: Hey Sarah. What's up?
[Message 105] Sarah: Someone said they saw me near the Go-Kart Track. Did you see me?
[Message 106] David: I didn't see you, no. I was at the diner, remember?
[Message 107] Sarah: Right, the diner. Okay, good. Just checking.
[Message 108] David: Why are you worried? You didn't do anything, did you?
[Message 109] Sarah: Of course not! Just...paranoid.

[Message 114] Maya: Yeah?
[Message 115] Chloe: When you saw Sarah, what time was it roughly?
[Message 116] Maya: Hmmm, maybe late afternoon? Around 5 maybe?
[Message 117] Chloe: Okay, thanks. Just trying to piece things together.
[Message 118] Maya: Sure. Why?
[Message 119] Chloe: No reason.

[Message 121] Liam: What? Why not?

[Message 123] Liam: Okay… weird.

[Message 124] Sarah: (To David) did they find out who killed Alex and Jordan yet?
[Message 125] David: No, not yet.
[Message 126] Sarah: Good. I mean… I hope they do soon.
[Message 127] David: Me too.

[Message 128] Chloe: (To Maya) I think David knows more than he's letting on.
[Message 129] Maya: Really? Why do you say that?
[Message 130] Chloe: Just a feeling. Something about how defensive he gets.
[Message 131] Maya: Hmmm. I see what you mean.
[Message 132] Chloe: I’m just wondering if her shouting probably provoked him that evening.
[Message 133] Maya: True.

[Message 134] Liam: (To David) You seem stressed. Everything okay?
[Message 135] David: Yeah, fine. Just tired of hearing about this whole thing.
[Message 136] Liam: I get it.

[Message 138] Liam: Whoa, David. Easy there. Fired who?
[Message 139] David: Never mind. Just talking.

[Message 140] Sarah: (To David) I saw you leave the building at Early Evening that night.
[Message 141] David: What? No, you didn't.
[Message 142] Sarah: I did, David. Don't lie to me.

[Message 143] David: (To Sarah) Listen, you need to keep your mouth shut.
[Message 144] Sarah: Or what, David? What are you going to do?
[Message 145] David: I'm just saying, the less you know, the better.
[Message 146] Sarah: I know enough to know you're involved.
[Message 147] David: I didn't purposefully do anything.
[Message 148] Sarah: The CCTV Footage is out, David.

[Message 152] Chloe: (To Maya) Any news?
[Message 153] Maya: Not really. Still investigating.

[Message 157] Liam: Okay.

[Message 158] Sarah: (To David) I'm going to the police.

[Message 160] Sarah: You knew he always hated 1.  Law Enforcement Officer.
[Message 161] David: It was an accident!

[Message 45] Sarah: I've heard of that! Is it as good as everyone says?
[Message 46] Mark: I think so. Super suspenseful and surprisingly funny.
[Message 47] Sarah: Maybe I'll give it a try. I need something to distract me from concrete dust.
[Message 48] Mark: Definitely worth a read. Okay, I'm going to check on Mr. Henderson. Pizza order placed?
[Message 49] Sarah: Order placed! Should be here in about 40 minutes. Go check on Mr. Henderson.
[Message 50] Mark: Awesome. Thanks again. Be right back.
[Message 51] Sarah: No problem.
[Message 52] Mark: (Back) He's resting comfortably. Seems the pain meds are finally working.
[Message 53] Sarah: That's good news.
[Message 54] Mark: Yeah. So, back to ""The Martian""...are you a sci-fi fan in general?
[Message 55] Sarah: Not really, but I'm open to anything. Especially if it involves escaping reality.
[Message 56] Mark: Haha, I understand that. I also enjoy historical fiction.
[Message 57] Sarah: Historical fiction...like what?
[Message 58] Mark: Ken Follett's ""The Pillars of the Earth"" is a favorite. Huge, but captivating.
[Message 59] Sarah: I'll have to look that up. I need something to occupy my time on these long nights.
[Message 60] Mark: Definitely. It's about building a cathedral in medieval England.
[Message 61] Sarah: Sounds interesting. A bit different than construction today, I imagine.
[Message 62] Mark: Vastly different! No power tools back then.
[Message 63] Sarah: Can you imagine? All that manual labor.
[Message 64] Mark: Makes you appreciate modern technology, doesn't it?
[Message 65] Sarah: Absolutely. Although, sometimes I miss the simplicity.
[Message 66] Mark: I get that. It's all a trade-off. Speaking of trade-offs, have you thought about where you want to live when you retire?
[Message 67] Sarah: Somewhere warm, definitely. Maybe Florida.
[Message 68] Mark: Florida is nice. Lots of retirees there.
[Message 69] Sarah: That's the idea. A little sunshine, a little peace and quiet.
[Message 70] Mark: Sounds idyllic. I'm more of a mountain person myself.
[Message 71] Sarah: The mountains are beautiful. Too cold for me though.
[Message 72] Mark: Fair enough. To each their own. The important thing is to find a place that makes you happy.
[Message 73] Sarah: Exactly. And maybe find a good book club.
[Message 74] Mark: Now you're talking! I haven't been in a book club in ages.
[Message 75] Sarah: We should start one! Just the two of us.
[Message 76] Mark: I'm in! What should we read first?
[Message 77] Sarah: We can alternate choosing. You pick the first one.
[Message 78] Mark: Okay, I'll give it some thought. Something we'll both enjoy.
[Message 79] Sarah: Sounds good. I trust your judgment.
[Message 80] Mark: Thanks! Let me peruse my bookshelf later.
[Message 81] Sarah: Great. I'm looking forward to it. Oh, I hear a car. Maybe it's the pizza!
[Message 82] Mark: Fingers crossed! Let me know when it gets here.
[Message 83] Sarah: Will do!
[Message 84] Sarah: Yep, pizza's here!
[Message 85] Mark: Awesome! I'll come grab it. Where are you?
[Message 86] Sarah: Waiting by the east entrance.
[Message 87] Mark: On my way.
[Message 88] Mark: (Back at the nurse's station) That smells amazing! Thanks again, Sarah.
[Message 89] Sarah: You're welcome! Enjoy!
[Message 90] Mark: You too! Spicy Supreme sounds delicious.
[Message 91] Sarah: It is! I just took a bite. Perfect amount of heat.
[Message 92] Mark: Excellent. Fuel for the rest of the night.
[Message 93] Sarah: Exactly! Speaking of fuel, I need a coffee.
[Message 94] Mark: Me too. Want to head to the break room together?
[Message 95] Sarah: Sure, give me a sec to grab my slice.
[Message 96] Mark: Sounds good. I'll meet you there.
[Message 97] Sarah: Be there in a few.
[Message 98] Mark: (In break room) Just brewing a fresh pot.
[Message 99] Sarah: Perfect timing!
[Message 100] Mark: How's that foundation coming along? Did they pour the concrete yet?
[Message 101] Sarah: They're starting tomorrow morning. That's gonna be a long day.
[Message 102] Mark: I can imagine. So much noise.
[Message 103] Sarah: Tell me about it. Hopefully, they'll be done quickly.
[Message 104] Mark: I hope so too. It's hard to concentrate with all the commotion.
[Message 105] Sarah: Seriously. Coffee's ready?
[Message 106] Mark: All yours. Help yourself.
[Message 107] Sarah: Thanks! You're a lifesaver.
[Message 108] Mark: Just doing my duty.
[Message 109] Sarah: So, Pillars of the Earth...where do I find it?
[Message 110] Mark: Any bookstore should have it. Or Amazon, of course.
[Message 111] Sarah: Amazon it is. Easier to browse in my PJs.
[Message 112] Mark: Haha, I understand. I do most of my shopping online these days.
[Message 113] Sarah: It's just so convenient. Especially after a long shift.
[Message 114] Mark: Absolutely. Don't even have to put on pants.
[Message 115] Sarah: The dream! Alright, coffee acquired. Back to the grind.
[Message 116] Mark: Good luck with the concrete tomorrow. I'll try to stay out of your way.
[Message 117] Sarah: Appreciate it. We'll try to keep the noise down.
[Message 118] Mark: I'm sure you will. Alright, back to charting for me.
[Message 119] Sarah: Same here. See you later, Mark.
[Message 120] Mark: See ya, Sarah. Thanks again for the pizza!
[Message 121] Sarah: Anytime!
[Message 122] Mark: Just had another slice...this Meat Lovers is seriously hitting the spot.
[Message 123] Sarah: Glad you like it!
[Message 124] Mark: I was thinking...for our book club, maybe we could start with something shorter?
[Message 125] Sarah: Good point. Pillars of the Earth is a commitment.
[Message 126] Mark: Yeah, maybe something by Agatha Christie?
[Message 127] Sarah: Ooh, a mystery! I like that.
[Message 128] Mark: ""And Then There Were None"" is a classic.
[Message 129] Sarah: Perfect! I've heard of it, but never read it.
[Message 130] Mark: It's a great starting point. Easy to get into.
[Message 131] Sarah: I'm sold. Agatha Christie it is!
[Message 132] Mark: Excellent. I'll order a copy for myself.
[Message 133] Sarah: Me too. We can discuss it next week.
[Message 134] Mark: Sounds like a plan. I'm actually looking forward to this.
[Message 135] Sarah: Me too! It'll be a nice change of pace.
[Message 136] Mark: Definitely. Anything is better than just watching TV.
[Message 137] Sarah: Agreed. I need to stimulate my brain.
[Message 138] Mark: And escape reality for a little while.
[Message 139] Sarah: Exactly. Best of both worlds.
[Message 140] Mark: So, how many more hours do you have left on your shift?
[Message 141] Sarah: About four. Feels like forty.
[Message 142] Mark: I hear you. I've got about five.
[Message 143] Sarah: We're almost there!
[Message 144] Mark: Almost. Just gotta keep pushing.
[Message 145] Sarah: Coffee, pizza, and Agatha Christie...we can do this.
[Message 146] Mark: Absolutely!
[Message 147] Sarah: I should probably get back to work now.
[Message 148] Mark: Me too. Let's chat later if we have time.
[Message 149] Sarah: Sounds good. See ya.
[Message 150] Mark: See ya, Sarah.
[Message 151] Sarah: Hey Mark, quick question...
[Message 152] Mark: What's up?
[Message 153] Sarah: Do you know if they fixed that pothole on First Colonial Road?
[Message 154] Mark: You know, I think I saw them working on it yesterday.
[Message 155] Sarah: Really? That's great news. It was a monster.
[Message 156] Mark: Yeah, it was swallowing cars whole. I'll double check when I leave.
[Message 157] Sarah: Appreciate it. It's on my way home.
[Message 158] Mark: No problem. Safety first.
[Message 159] Sarah: Exactly. Okay, back to concrete.
[Message 160] Mark: Good luck!
[Message 161] Mark: Hey Sarah, just drove past the pothole...it's fixed!
[Message 162] Sarah: Awesome! You're the best. Thanks for checking!
[Message 163] Mark: No problem at all. Drive safe!
[Message 164] Sarah: I will. You too!
[Message 165] Mark: Will do. Time for my final rounds.
[Message 166] Sarah: Good luck!
[Message 167] Mark: Thanks! One more hour...I can smell freedom.
[Message 168] Sarah: I know the feeling.
[Message 169] Mark: Thinking about hitting the beach tomorrow. Need some sun.
[Message 170] Sarah: Sounds amazing. Enjoy!
[Message 171] Mark: Maybe I'll see you there.
[Message 172] Sarah: Maybe! If I'm not too exhausted.
[Message 173] Mark: True. A nap might be in order.
[Message 174] Sarah: Definitely. A long nap.
[Message 175] Mark: Well, I'm gonna sign off for now. Gotta finish up.
[Message 176] Sarah: Okay, me too. Thanks for the pizza and the conversation!
[Message 177] Mark: Anytime, Sarah! It was a pleasure. Get some rest.
[Message 178] Sarah: You too! See ya.
[Message 179] Mark: See ya!
[Message 180] Sarah: Good night!
[Message 181] Mark: Good night!
[Message 182] Sarah: Almost home.
[Message 183] Mark: Hope you have a good drive!
[Message 184] Sarah: I will. Listening to some tunes.
[Message 185] Mark: Nice!
[Message 186] Sarah: Home sweet home!
[Message 187] Mark: Get some sleep!
[Message 188] Sarah: I will!
[Message 189] Mark: Good night again!
[Message 190] Sarah: Good night!",0,
519,"[Message 1] Liam: Hey everyone! Car wash line is moving slow as molasses. Anyone got any interesting tech news to share while we wait?
[Message 2] Maya: Hey Liam! Ugh, tell me about it. I saw something about a new AI-powered photo editor. Sounds pretty cool.
[Message 3] Chloe: AI photo editor? Sounds like it could be fun, but also kinda scary. Where's the line between editing and manipulating reality?
[Message 4] Owen: True, Chloe. But think of the possibilities for artists and designers!
[Message 5] Noah: Possibilities are endless! Anyone tried the new iOS update? My phone feels smoother.
[Message 6] Liam: Downloading it now, Noah. Good to know! Maya, what photo editor was that?
[Message 7] Maya: It was called ""Prism AI"" or something like that. I'll try to find the article again.
[Message 8] Chloe: ""Prism AI""... I'll look it up too. Maybe it'll help me touch up my sculpting photos, haha.
[Message 9] Owen: Sculpting, Chloe? That's awesome! What kind of stuff do you make?
[Message 10] Noah: Agreed, Chloe! I didn’t know that about you!
[Message 11] Chloe: Mostly abstract stuff. It's a good way to unwind.
[Message 12] Liam: Totally. I find playing my guitar has the same effect.
[Message 13] Maya: What kind of guitar, Liam?
[Message 14] Liam: A vintage Gibson ES-335. It's my baby.
[Message 15] Owen: Wow, a 335! Jealous! I've always wanted one.
[Message 16] Noah: My grandpa had a Gibson. I wonder what ever happened to it.
[Message 17] Chloe: Maybe it's time to track it down, Noah! Sentimental value, you know?
[Message 18] Noah: I know! After this carwash, I'll look in the attic.
[Message 19] Maya: Good luck, Noah! Liam, back to the tech topic - have you heard about those new foldable phones? Are they worth the hype?
[Message 20] Liam: I'm skeptical, Maya. Seems like a gimmick to me. Durability is my main concern.
[Message 21] Owen: I agree with Liam. I'd rather have a solid, reliable phone.
[Message 22] Chloe: My concern is the price point. Those things are crazy expensive!
[Message 23] Noah: Agreed, Chloe. I'd rather spend that money on something else. Like car washes! Haha.
[Message 24] Maya: Haha, true! Good point, Noah.
[Message 25] Liam: Speaking of cars, anyone considering an electric vehicle?
[Message 26] Owen: I am! The range is getting better, and the charging infrastructure is improving.
[Message 27] Chloe: I'm thinking about it, too. But the upfront cost is still a barrier.
[Message 28] Noah: I like the idea, but I'm a bit of a traditionalist. I love the sound of a good engine.
[Message 29] Maya: My concern is the battery replacement cost down the line. Seems like a big expense.
[Message 30] Liam: That's a valid point, Maya. Something to consider for sure.
[Message 31] Owen: Maybe in a few years the technology will be more affordable and reliable.
[Message 32] Chloe: Here's that Prism AI link, in the meantime! [link to a fictional tech website]
[Message 33] Noah: Thanks Chloe!
[Message 34] Maya: Thanks! I'll check it out.
[Message 35] Liam: Thanks, Chloe! Appreciate it. Okay, just pulled up to the wash bay.
[Message 36] Owen: Good timing! I'm next in line. Catch you all later!
[Message 37] Chloe: Bye Owen!
[Message 38] Noah: See ya!
[Message 39] Maya: Bye!
[Message 40] Liam: Later, Owen! Anyone else still waiting?
[Message 41] Chloe: Still waiting. Maybe I'll start sketching while I wait.
[Message 42] Noah: Good idea! Productive waiting!
[Message 43] Maya: Same here. Thinking about that AI photo editor.
[Message 44] Liam: Yeah, it's interesting. I'm still a bit wary of AI taking over everything, though.
[Message 45] Chloe: I get that. It's a bit unsettling to think about.
[Message 46] Noah: I'm just hoping it doesn't take over my job, haha.
[Message 47] Maya: What do you do, Noah?
[Message 48] Noah: I'm a mechanic. I doubt AI will be able to fix a carburetor anytime soon!
[Message 49] Liam: Ha! Good point!
[Message 50] Chloe: Never say never, Noah! But I agree, some things are best left to human hands.
[Message 51] Maya: True! There's something about the skill and experience of a good mechanic that AI can't replicate.
[Message 52] Liam: Absolutely. I feel the same way about musicians.
[Message 53] Chloe: And sculptors!
[Message 54] Noah: You guys are making me feel good about my profession!
[Message 55] Maya: You should! It's a valuable skill.
[Message 56] Liam: Totally. We need people who can fix things.
[Message 57] Chloe: Especially now that everything is so reliant on technology.
[Message 58] Noah: Speaking of technology... anyone using those smart home assistants? Like Alexa or Google Home?
[Message 59] Maya: I have a Google Home. It's pretty handy for setting timers and playing music.
[Message 60] Liam: I'm a little paranoid about them listening to everything I say.
[Message 61] Chloe: I understand that concern, Liam. It's a bit creepy.
[Message 62] Noah: I don't have one. I prefer to do things myself.
[Message 63] Maya: That's fair. I mostly use it for convenience.
[Message 64] Liam: I guess it's all about weighing the pros and cons.
[Message 65] Chloe: Exactly. Everything has its trade-offs.
[Message 66] Noah: You guys are making me think about getting one, though. Maybe just for the music.
[Message 67] Maya: You could try it out and see if you like it.
[Message 68] Liam: Just be careful what you say around it! Haha.
[Message 69] Chloe: Seriously!
[Message 70] Noah: Noted! Haha.
[Message 71] Maya: My car is almost up! Gotta go!
[Message 72] Liam: Alright, Maya! Have a good one!
[Message 73] Chloe: Bye Maya!
[Message 74] Noah: Later!
[Message 75] Maya: Bye everyone! Talk later!
[Message 76] Liam: Still here, Chloe and Noah?
[Message 77] Chloe: Yep! Still waiting.
[Message 78] Noah: Same.
[Message 79] Liam: Any other tech topics on your mind?
[Message 80] Chloe: Hmmm... what do you guys think about virtual reality?
[Message 81] Noah: I've never tried it. Seems kinda isolating.
[Message 82] Liam: I've tried it a few times. It's definitely immersive, but I agree, it can be isolating.
[Message 83] Chloe: I think it has potential for education and training.
[Message 84] Noah: That's a good point, Chloe. It could be useful for learning new skills.
[Message 85] Liam: Yeah, I can see that. Simulations and stuff like that.
[Message 86] Chloe: Exactly! Imagine learning to sculpt in VR.
[Message 87] Noah: That would be cool!
[Message 88] Liam: Or learning to play guitar!
[Message 89] Chloe: See? Possibilities!
[Message 90] Noah: Okay, you guys have convinced me. I need to try VR.
[Message 91] Liam: There are some VR arcades around Madison.
[Message 92] Chloe: We should all go sometime!
[Message 93] Noah: I'm in!
[Message 94] Liam: Sounds like a plan! After the car wash, of course.
[Message 95] Chloe: Of course! Priorities!
[Message 96] Noah: Haha. What's your favorite style of music, Liam?
[Message 97] Liam: Blues, mostly. But I also like jazz and some rock.
[Message 98] Chloe: I listen to a lot of classical music when I'm sculpting. It helps me focus.
[Message 99] Noah: I'm more of a country guy.
[Message 100] Liam: Nice! A little something for everyone.
[Message 101] Chloe: Exactly! Diversity is the spice of life.
[Message 102] Noah: Speaking of spice... anyone hungry?
[Message 103] Liam: Always!
[Message 104] Chloe: Me too!
[Message 105] Noah: There's that new taco place down the street.
[Message 106] Liam: I've heard good things about it.
[Message 107] Chloe: Maybe we should grab some tacos after the VR arcade.
[Message 108] Noah: Perfect!
[Message 109] Liam: Sounds like a plan! Alright, I'm all clean! Gotta roll.
[Message 110] Chloe: Bye Liam!
[Message 111] Noah: See ya, Liam!
[Message 112] Liam: Later, guys! Enjoy the rest of your day!
[Message 113] Chloe: You too!
[Message 114] Noah: You too! Still here, Chloe?
[Message 115] Chloe: Still here! Almost up, though.
[Message 116] Noah: Cool. What kind of sculpting do you do?
[Message 117] Chloe: Mostly abstract stuff, like I said. I like working with clay and stone.
[Message 118] Noah: That's really cool! I've always admired artists.
[Message 119] Chloe: Thanks, Noah! It's a labor of love.
[Message 120] Noah: I bet!
[Message 121] Chloe: Do you ever work on your own car?
[Message 122] Noah: All the time! That's part of the fun of being a mechanic.
[Message 123] Chloe: I can imagine! It must be satisfying to fix something yourself.
[Message 124] Noah: It is! Especially when it's something that's been giving you trouble for a while.
[Message 125] Chloe: I get that feeling when I finally finish a sculpture.
[Message 126] Noah: It's the best feeling in the world!
[Message 127] Chloe: Agreed! Okay, almost up! One more minute!
[Message 128] Noah: Nice!
[Message 129] Chloe: You should try sculpting sometime, Noah!
[Message 130] Noah: Maybe I will! I'm always looking for new hobbies.
[Message 131] Chloe: It's a good way to relax and express yourself.
[Message 132] Noah: I need something like that in my life.
[Message 133] Chloe: We all do!
[Message 134] Noah: True. Okay, I think my car is next!
[Message 135] Chloe: Awesome!
[Message 136] Noah: See ya later, Chloe! It was nice chatting with you!
[Message 137] Chloe: You too, Noah! Bye!
[Message 138] Noah: Bye!
[Message 139] Chloe: Finally! My turn!
[Message 140] Chloe: (Silence for a bit)
[Message 141] Chloe: Okay, all clean and shiny! Time to head home!
[Message 142] Chloe: What should I sculpt next? Hmmm...
[Message 143] Chloe: Maybe something inspired by VR... a virtual sculpture?
[Message 144] Chloe: Or maybe something completely different... a portrait?
[Message 145] Chloe: Decisions, decisions!
[Message 146] Chloe: (More silence)
[Message 147] Chloe: I wonder if that Prism AI photo editor is any good...
[Message 148] Chloe: Maybe I'll try it out later.
[Message 149] Chloe: It could be useful for touching up my sculpting photos for my website.
[Message 150] Chloe: (More silence)
[Message 151] Chloe: Okay, time to stop thinking about work and just relax!
[Message 152] Chloe: Maybe I'll watch a movie when I get home.
[Message 153] Chloe: Or maybe I'll just take a nap.
[Message 154] Chloe: Naps are always a good idea.
[Message 155] Chloe: (Silence)
[Message 156] Chloe: Speaking of movies... anyone seen anything good lately?
[Message 157] Chloe: (Silence... maybe they all left?)
[Message 158] Chloe: Helloooo? Is anyone still here?
[Message 159] Chloe: Guess not.
[Message 160] Chloe: Oh well. Guess I'll just talk to myself then.
[Message 161] Chloe: This is what happens when you're waiting in a car wash line.
[Message 162] Chloe: You start talking to yourself.
[Message 163] Chloe: It's a very existential experience.
[Message 164] Chloe: (Silence)
[Message 165] Chloe: I should probably just put my phone away and drive.
[Message 166] Chloe: But it's so boring!
[Message 167] Chloe: Maybe I'll listen to some music.
[Message 168] Chloe: That's a good idea.
[Message 169] Chloe: (Silence while listening to music)
[Message 170] Chloe: Okay, much better!
[Message 171] Chloe: Music always makes everything better.
[Message 172] Chloe: Especially after a long car wash wait.
[Message 173] Chloe: (More music)
[Message 174] Chloe: Almost home now!
[Message 175] Chloe: Can't wait to get back to my sculpting studio.
[Message 176] Chloe: It's my happy place.
[Message 177] Chloe: (Silence)
[Message 178] Chloe: I wonder what Liam and Noah are up to now.
[Message 179] Chloe: Probably grabbing those tacos.
[Message 180] Chloe: I should have gone with them.
[Message 181] Chloe: Oh well. Next time.
[Message 182] Chloe: (Silence)
[Message 183] Chloe: Almost there!
[Message 184] Chloe: Just a few more blocks.
[Message 185] Chloe: And then... freedom!
[Message 186] Chloe: (Silence)
[Message 187] Chloe: Okay, I'm home!
[Message 188] Chloe: Time to relax!
[Message 189] Chloe: And maybe do some sculpting.
[Message 190] Chloe: (Silence)
[Message 191] Chloe: Bye, car wash chat!
[Message 192] Chloe: It was... interesting.
[Message 193] Chloe: (Silence)
[Message 194] Chloe: Okay, bye for real!

520,"[Message 1] Kai: Hey guys, have you heard about what happened at the soup kitchen?
[Message 2] Jamie: Yeah, it's all over the news. Awful.
[Message 3] River: I saw the headlines. Another bad day in Camden. What's the deal?
[Message 4] Kai: Apparently, River and Alex... dead.
[Message 5] Jamie: What?! River and Alex?! No way.
[Message 6] River: I can't believe it. How?
[Message 7] Kai: Apparently Strangulation with a rope . The cops are all over it.
[Message 8] Jamie: Strangulation with a rope ?! Jesus. I saw River just last week.
[Message 9] River: I was there yesterday morning! Around Late Morning. Gave Alex some soup.
[Message 10] Kai: River, you were at the soup kitchen yesterday? Did you see anything weird?
[Message 11] River: Nope. Just the usual crowd. Why?
[Message 12] Jamie: River, this is serious. If you saw anything, you need to tell the police.
[Message 13] River: I'm telling you, I didn't see anything suspicious. I left by 10:30.
[Message 14] Kai: Okay, okay. Just breathe. Jamie, calm down too.
[Message 15] Jamie: Easy for you to say. You didn't know them.
[Message 16] Ashton: Guys, what's going on? My phone's blowing up.
[Message 17] Kai: Ashton, River and Alex were murdered at the soup kitchen.
[Message 18] Ashton: WHAT?! That's insane!
[Message 19] River: Yeah, it's pretty messed up.
[Message 20] Jamie: Did either of you see anything weird lately? Anything at all?
[Message 21] Ashton: No, just the usual drama. You know, the soup kitchen gets a little tense sometimes.
[Message 22] Kai: Tense how?
[Message 23] Ashton: Just petty stuff. People arguing over portions, that kind of thing.
[Message 24] Jamie: This is Camden. It's always ""petty stuff"".
[Message 25] River: Relax, Jamie. It's not like we can solve the case over text.
[Message 26] Jamie: Maybe not, but every little bit helps.
[Message 27] Kai: Did River have any enemies?
[Message 28] Ashton: He was a good dude. Creative, but kept to himself. I can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him.
[Message 29] River: I'm telling you, I have no idea. I think you guys are overreacting.
[Message 30] Jamie: Overreacting? Two people are dead!
[Message 31] Ashton: Maybe it was a robbery gone wrong?
[Message 32] Kai: Maybe. But Strangulation with a rope sounds…personal.
[Message 33] Jamie: Exactly! And what about Alex?
[Message 34] River: She was withdrawn. Always seemed stressed.
[Message 35] Ashton: She was always complaining about the manager, old man Hemlock.
[Message 36] Kai: Hemlock? What about him?
[Message 37] Ashton: Just that he was a jerk. Always on her case.
[Message 38] Jamie: Maybe Hemlock did it.
[Message 39] River: Jamie, come on. He's an old man.
[Message 40] Jamie: Old men can be dangerous. I wouldn't rule it out.
[Message 41] Kai: We should tell the cops about Hemlock.
[Message 42] Ashton: Already did. They said they'd look into it.
[Message 43] Jamie: Good.
[Message 44] River: Guys, can we talk about something else? This is freaking me out.
[Message 45] Kai: Sure, River. What's up?
[Message 46] River: I'm just worried about my dog, Blue. He's been acting weird lately.
[Message 47] Jamie: This is your concern right now?
[Message 48] River: I was buying Strangulation with a rope at the store to secure the yard for him. I intended to fix the fence, honest!
[Message 49] Ashton: Look, I gotta go. I have a shift at the library.
[Message 50] Kai: Okay, Ashton. Stay safe.
[Message 51] Jamie: Yeah, be careful.
[Message 52] Ashton: You too.
[Message 53] River: Bye, Ashton.
[Message 54] Jamie: So, River, about Alex… did she ever mention anyone threatening her?
[Message 55] River: No, never. I barely spoke to her.
[Message 56] Kai: Jamie, lay off him. He's clearly upset.
[Message 57] Jamie: I'm just trying to help!
[Message 58] River: It's okay, Kai. I understand.
[Message 59] Jamie: Did Alex or River do anything strange around Late Morning?
[Message 60] Kai: Did the manager ever yell at her around Late Morning?
[Message 61] River: I heard her arguing with someone on the phone last week. Sounded intense.
[Message 62] Jamie: Did you hear what they were saying?
[Message 63] River: No, just yelling.
[Message 64] Kai: Who was she yelling at?
[Message 65] River: I couldn't tell. It was muffled.
[Message 66] Jamie: Damn it. This is so frustrating. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 67] Kai: I know. It's awful.
[Message 68] River: Maybe it was some random act of violence. Camden's full of it.
[Message 69] Jamie: Maybe. But I have a feeling it's more complicated than that.
[Message 70] Kai: What do you mean?
[Message 71] Jamie: Just a feeling. Like someone knew them, maybe even hated them. He always hated River. He just needed the right motivation.
[Message 72] River: Guys, I'm going to log off for a bit. I need a break.
[Message 73] Kai: Okay, River. Take care.
[Message 74] Jamie: Yeah, take it easy.
[Message 75] Ashton: Hey, back. Library was dead. Anything new?
[Message 76] Kai: Nothing much. River logged off. Jamie's still trying to play detective.
[Message 77] Ashton: Jamie needs to chill. He's gonna give himself a heart attack.
[Message 78] Jamie: Someone has to care! You guys are acting like it's just another day.
[Message 79] Ashton: We care, Jamie, but freaking out isn't going to bring them back.
[Message 80] Kai: Exactly. We need to stay calm and let the police do their job.
[Message 81] Jamie: Easy for you to say. What are you two doing right now?
[Message 82] Kai: I'm watching TV. Trying to distract myself.
[Message 83] Ashton: I'm making dinner. Spaghetti. Want some?
[Message 84] Jamie: No thanks. I'm not hungry.
[Message 85] Kai: You should eat something, Jamie.
[Message 86] Jamie: I'll eat later. I'm going to go drive by the soup kitchen.
[Message 87] Ashton: Are you crazy? Don't do that!
[Message 88] Kai: Yeah, Jamie, that's a bad idea.
[Message 89] Jamie: I just want to see if I can see anything the cops missed.
[Message 90] Ashton: You're going to get yourself arrested.
[Message 91] Kai: Seriously, Jamie, don't. I'm trying to talk him out of it.
[Message 92] Jamie: Fine, fine. I won't go. But I'm not giving up on this.
[Message 93] Ashton: No one's asking you to give up. Just be smart about it.
[Message 94] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 95] Jamie: So, what do we do now? Just sit around and wait?
[Message 96] Ashton: Pretty much. Unless you have a better idea.
[Message 97] Jamie: I wish I did. This is killing me.
[Message 98] Kai: Me too.
[Message 99] Ashton: Look, I'm going to finish making dinner. I'll check in later.
[Message 100] Kai: Okay, Ashton.
[Message 101] Jamie: Alright.
[Message 102] Kai: Jamie, are you still there?
[Message 103] Jamie: Yeah.
[Message 104] Kai: Maybe it really was just some random act of violence.
[Message 105] Jamie: I doubt it. Too convenient.
[Message 106] Kai: What do you mean?
[Message 107] Jamie: Nothing. Just thinking out loud.
[Message 108] Kai: Okay. Well, I'm going to go do something else. This is stressing me out too much.
[Message 109] Jamie: Alright. I'll let you know if I hear anything.
[Message 110] Kai: Thanks.
[Message 111] Jamie: You think River could've been involved?
[Message 112] Kai: What?! No way! River's harmless.
[Message 113] Jamie: I don't know, he was acting kinda weird. And he was there that morning.
[Message 114] Kai: You're grasping at straws, Jamie. Leave him alone.
[Message 115] Jamie: Fine. But I'm not ruling anyone out.
[Message 116] Kai: Suit yourself.
[Message 117] Jamie: I saw River leave the building at Late Morning, he acted like he did something wrong.
[Message 118] Kai: You're just paranoid.
[Message 119] Jamie: I have a bad feeling about this, Kai. A really bad feeling. I intend to figure this out.
[Message 120] Kai: Just be careful, Jamie. Don't let your paranoia get you into trouble.",1,
521,"[Message 1] Liam: Dude, you won't believe what happened at the dealership today.
[Message 2] Noah: What? Spill!
[Message 3] Liam: 7.  Activist is dead. Found in their office.
[Message 4] Noah: WHAT?! Seriously? How?
[Message 5] Liam: Not sure, cops are everywhere. It's insane.
[Message 6] Chloe: Did you hear about 7.  Activist? This is unreal.
[Message 7] Liam: Yeah, Chloe, it's all anyone's talking about. You okay? You seemed close to them.
[Message 8] Chloe: I am NOT okay. They were my friend. I can't believe this.
[Message 9] Noah: Chloe, I'm so sorry. That's awful.
[Message 10] Liam: Did you see anything weird today, Chloe? Anything at all?
[Message 11] Chloe: No! Why would you ask me that?
[Message 12] Liam: Just, you know, trying to piece things together.
[Message 13] Noah: Lay off her, Liam. She's grieving.
[Message 14] Liam: Sorry, sorry. Just…shocked.
[Message 15] Chloe: I need some time to process this.
[Message 16] Noah: Of course, Chloe. We're here for you.
[Message 17] Liam: Seriously. Anything you need.
[Message 18] Chloe: Thanks.
[Message 19] Noah: Hey, Liam, remember that guy, Ash, who was always complaining about 7.  Activist?
[Message 20] Liam: Yeah, vaguely. What about him?
[Message 21] Noah: I saw Ash leave the building around Midday. Looked kinda flustered.
[Message 22] Liam: Really? Midday? That's when it happened, right?
[Message 23] Noah: That’s what I heard.
[Message 24] Liam: I saw Ash buying Asphyxiation by strangulation a few days ago. Coincidence?
[Message 25] Noah: That's messed up, Liam. You should tell the cops.
[Message 26] Liam: Maybe… it's probably nothing. Don't want to jump to conclusions.
[Message 27] Noah: Better safe than sorry, man.
[Message 28] Chloe: Leave Ash alone. He wouldn’t do something like that.
[Message 29] Liam: How do you know, Chloe?
[Message 30] Chloe: I just… I know him. He's not violent.
[Message 31] Noah: Everyone's capable of anything under the right circumstances.
[Message 32] Liam: True.
[Message 33] Chloe: This is all so horrible. Did they say how it happened?
[Message 34] Liam: Not officially. Rumor is Asphyxiation by strangulation.
[Message 35] Chloe: Oh god.
[Message 36] Noah: That’s brutal.
[Message 37] Liam: Hey, you guys free for pizza tonight? Need to take my mind off this.
[Message 38] Noah: Sure, I'm in. Chloe?
[Message 39] Chloe: I can't. Thanks though.
[Message 40] Liam: Okay. Another time.
[Message 41] Noah: Yeah, Chloe, take care of yourself.
[Message 42] Chloe: I will.
[Message 43] Liam: So, pizza at my place at 7?
[Message 44] Noah: Sounds good.
[Message 45] Chloe: I keep thinking about what 7.  Activist was working on. They were getting close to exposing some shady stuff with the company.
[Message 46] Liam: Shady stuff? What kind of shady stuff?
[Message 47] Chloe: I don't know specifics, but it was about the company funds being misused.
[Message 48] Noah: That could be a motive for someone, right?
[Message 49] Liam: Definitely. Someone at the top, maybe?
[Message 50] Chloe: Maybe. Or someone who was going to get caught up in it.
[Message 51] Noah: Did 7.  Activist mention anyone in particular?
[Message 52] Chloe: No, they were being really careful. Said they didn't want to put anyone at risk.
[Message 53] Liam: Smart.
[Message 54] Noah: I remember Ash was talking about hurting 7.  Activist right before he went over there.
[Message 55] Chloe: Stop it, Noah! You're making things up.
[Message 56] Noah: I'm just saying what I heard.
[Message 57] Liam: Calm down, guys. Let's not accuse anyone without proof.
[Message 58] Chloe: Exactly!
[Message 59] Liam: Anyway, pizza at 7. See you then, Noah.
[Message 60] Noah: See ya.
[Message 61] Chloe: I can't believe you guys are just going to eat pizza after this.
[Message 62] Liam: What else are we supposed to do, Chloe? We can't bring 7.  Activist back.
[Message 63] Chloe: I don't know. Mourn, maybe?
[Message 64] Noah: We are mourning, Chloe. But life goes on.
[Message 65] Chloe: Whatever.
[Message 66] Liam: Look, I'm sorry you're upset. We'll talk later, okay?
[Message 67] Chloe: Fine.
[Message 68] Noah: So, you think it was someone at the dealership?
[Message 69] Liam: It's possible. Or maybe someone 7.  Activist knew outside of work.
[Message 70] Noah: True. They were an activist, right? Probably made some enemies.
[Message 71] Liam: Yeah, could be anything.
[Message 72] Noah: I heard the cops are looking into the manager, David.
[Message 73] Liam: David? Why?
[Message 74] Noah: Apparently, he and 7.  Activist had a huge argument last week.
[Message 75] Liam: About what?
[Message 76] Noah: No idea. But it was loud. Everyone heard it.
[Message 77] Liam: Interesting.
[Message 78] Noah: Maybe he fired 7.  Activist, and that’s why none of this would have happened.
[Message 79] Liam: Could be. He's always seemed like a jerk.
[Message 80] Noah: Yeah, he's definitely got a temper.
[Message 81] Liam: Speaking of tempers, remember how mad Ash got when 7.  Activist wouldn't go out with him?
[Message 82] Noah: Oh yeah! He was obsessed.
[Message 83] Liam: ""She said she wanted to get rid of him."" - Direct quote from Ash a few weeks ago.
[Message 84] Noah: Dude, you should tell the cops that.
[Message 85] Liam: I know, I know. Just… processing.
[Message 86] Noah: Alright. See you at 7.
[Message 87] Liam: Later.
[Message 88] Chloe: So you're really just going to throw Ash under the bus?
[Message 89] Liam: I'm not throwing anyone under the bus, Chloe. I'm just stating facts.
[Message 90] Chloe: Those aren't facts! You're twisting things.
[Message 91] Liam: What do you mean?
[Message 92] Chloe: You know what I mean. You’re just trying to pin this on him.
[Message 93] Liam: Why would I do that?
[Message 94] Chloe: Because you’re jealous of him!
[Message 95] Liam: Jealous? Of Ash? That's ridiculous.
[Message 96] Chloe: Is it? You always liked 7.  Activist, too.
[Message 97] Liam: What does that have to do with anything?
[Message 98] Chloe: Maybe you intended for this to happen. Maybe you saw 7.  Activist as a rival too.
[Message 99] Liam: That's insane, Chloe!
[Message 100] Chloe: Is it?
[Message 101] Liam: I'm done with this conversation.
[Message 102] Chloe: Yeah, run away.
[Message 103] Liam: Unbelievable.
[Message 104] Noah: Hey, pizza's here. You on your way?
[Message 105] Liam: Yeah, be there in 5.
[Message 106] Noah: Cool. So, about Ash... do you think he's really capable of this?
[Message 107] Liam: I don't know, man. I honestly don't. But that comment about getting rid of them…
[Message 108] Noah: I know, that's pretty damning. Especially since he was looking up how to make Asphyxiation by strangulation online before it happened.
[Message 109] Liam: Wait, what? How do you know that?
[Message 110] Noah: A friend works at the library. Said Ash was on their computers a few days ago.
[Message 111] Liam: Holy crap.
[Message 112] Noah: Hope they don't get the death penalty
[Message 113] Liam: Yeah, well… if he did it, he deserves whatever he gets.
[Message 114] Noah: True.
[Message 115] Liam: Coming up.
[Message 116] Noah: Alright.
[Message 117] Chloe: You guys are really making a mistake.
[Message 118] Liam: What do you mean?
[Message 119] Chloe: You're focusing on the wrong person.
[Message 120] Liam: Who should we be focusing on then, Chloe? You seem to know so much.
[Message 121] Chloe: Maybe you should look closer to home.
[Message 122] Liam: What's that supposed to mean?
[Message 123] Chloe: Just think about it. Who benefits the most from 7.  Activist's death?
[Message 124] Liam: I have no idea.
[Message 125] Chloe: Think about the money.
[Message 126] Liam: Okay, now you're just being cryptic.
[Message 127] Chloe: Maybe. Or maybe I'm trying to protect someone.
[Message 128] Liam: Protect someone who killed 7.  Activist?
[Message 129] Chloe: I didn't say that.
[Message 130] Liam: You heavily implied it.
[Message 131] Chloe: Just think about it, Liam. Before you ruin someone's life.
[Message 132] Liam: I will. But you need to be straight with us, Chloe. If you know something, you have to tell the police.
[Message 133] Chloe: I can't.
[Message 134] Liam: Why not?
[Message 135] Chloe: Because I can't. Just… trust me.
[Message 136] Liam: I don't know if I can.
[Message 137] Chloe: Fine.
[Message 138] Liam: Look, I'm leaving for Noah's. We can talk more later if you want.
[Message 139] Chloe: Whatever.
[Message 140] Liam: See ya.
[Message 141] Noah: Everything okay with Chloe? She seems really upset.
[Message 142] Liam: Yeah, she's convinced we're wrong about Ash.
[Message 143] Noah: And you're not?
[Message 144] Liam: I don't know what to think anymore.
[Message 145] Noah: Well, let's just try to enjoy the pizza and not talk about it anymore tonight.
[Message 146] Liam: Good plan.
[Message 147] Noah: Cheers.
[Message 148] Liam: Cheers.
[Message 149] Chloe: If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 150] Liam: What do you mean Chloe? You there?
[Message 151] Chloe: The manager, David. He knew.
[Message 152] Liam: He knew what? Knew about the shady stuff?
[Message 153] Chloe: More than you think.
[Message 154] Liam: What is more than I think???

[Message 4] MARK: Dana was always so nice. I used to buy from her.
[Message 5] CHLOE: Ben too. He always made sure everyone was safe. Remember that time he stopped that fight outside O’Malley’s?
[Message 6] MARK: Yeah, he was a good guy. Any leads yet?
[Message 7] CHLOE: I heard the cops are talking to everyone who worked there or knew them.
[Message 8] MARK: I bet. So, you think it was arson?
[Message 9] CHLOE: That’s what I heard. Someone intentionally Arson by setting a fire the place.
[Message 10] MARK: Damn. So messed up.
[Message 11] CHLOE: Seriously. I can't believe it.
[Message 12] MARK: Hey, you busy later? Wanna grab a drink, take our minds off things?
[Message 13] CHLOE: Maybe. Gotta see if I need to talk to the police.

[Message 21] CHLOE: Did you know them well?
[Message 22] LIAM: I saw Ben around. He always seemed alright. Never really talked. I did business with Dana every now and then.
[Message 23] CHLOE: Oh.
[Message 24] LIAM: Why? What’s up?
[Message 25] CHLOE: Just… curious. The police are asking about everyone’s relationship with them.
[Message 26] LIAM: Makes sense. Gotta catch whoever did this.
[Message 27] CHLOE: Yeah.
[Message 28] LIAM: You think they'll find them? I'm hoping they get the death penalty for this.

[Message 37] MARK: Did you tell them about Liam?
[Message 38] CHLOE: What about him?
[Message 39] MARK: He always hated Dana. Said she was ripping him off.

[Message 71] CHLOE: I know! I didn’t say anything, just played dumb.
[Message 72] MARK: Good move.
[Message 73] CHLOE: He seemed really nervous.
[Message 74] MARK: He should be.
[Message 75] CHLOE: What do we do?
[Message 76] MARK: We keep an eye on him. See what he does.
[Message 77] CHLOE: Okay.
[Message 78] MARK: And we don't tell him we suspect anything.

[Message 94] LIAM: Come on. It’ll be good.
[Message 95] CHLOE: I’ll think about it.

[Message 101] MARK: Did Liam ask you about coffee?
[Message 102] CHLOE: Yeah, how did you know?
[Message 103] MARK: He asked me if I’d seen you. He’s definitely sus.
[Message 104] CHLOE: I agree. I’m starting to get really creeped out.

[Message 106] CHLOE: I wasn’t planning to.
[Message 107] MARK: Good. Stay safe, Chloe.
[Message 108] CHLOE: You too, Mark.
[Message 109] MARK: We’ll figure this out.
[Message 110] CHLOE: I hope so.
[Message 111] LIAM: Hey Mark, can I ask you something?
[Message 112] MARK: What’s up?
[Message 113] LIAM: Do you think I should talk to the police again? About…everything.
[Message 114] MARK: Why would you do that?
[Message 115] LIAM: I don’t know. Just… maybe I missed something. Or… maybe I should tell them I was looking up how to make Arson by setting a fire.
[Message 116] MARK: Looking up what now? Why were you doing that?
[Message 117] LIAM: No reason! Just…curious. It was for a story I was writing.
[Message 118] MARK: A story? Right.
[Message 119] LIAM: Yeah! So, you think I should tell them that? To clear things up?
[Message 120] MARK: I think you should do whatever makes you feel better, Liam.
[Message 121] LIAM: Okay. Thanks, Mark.
[Message 122] MARK: Anytime.
[Message 123] MARK: Chloe, Liam just admitted he was looking up how to make Arson by setting a fire online!
[Message 124] CHLOE: What?! Are you serious?
[Message 125] MARK: Dead serious. He said it was for a story, but…
[Message 126] CHLOE: That's it. We need to tell the police everything.
[Message 127] MARK: I agree.
[Message 128] CHLOE: Let’s go to the station tomorrow morning. First thing.
[Message 129] MARK: Okay. Deal.
[Message 130] CHLOE: This is insane.
[Message 131] MARK: Tell me about it.
[Message 132] LIAM: Mark, you didn't tell Chloe about what I told you, did you?
[Message 133] MARK: About the story? No.
[Message 134] LIAM: Good. It's just... I don't want her to misunderstand.
[Message 135] MARK: I get it.
[Message 136] LIAM: Thanks, man. You're a good friend.
[Message 137] MARK: No problem.
[Message 138] CHLOE: He's trying to cover his tracks.
[Message 139] MARK: Definitely. He knows we suspect something.
[Message 140] CHLOE: This is getting scary.
[Message 141] MARK: We're doing the right thing.
[Message 142] CHLOE: I hope so.
[Message 143] MARK: We will.
[Message 144] CHLOE: Goodnight, Mark.
[Message 145] MARK: Night, Chloe. Get some rest.
[Message 146] MARK: Chloe, something's not adding up.
[Message 147] CHLOE: What do you mean?
[Message 148] MARK: Think about it. Liam's nervous, sure, but he's almost *too* obvious. Like he *wants* us to think he did it. Maybe its mental illness-induced delusion.
[Message 149] CHLOE: So you think he's covering for someone?
[Message 150] MARK: Maybe. Or he's just a red herring. Someone is involved and probably was aware of the potential punishment.
[Message 151] CHLOE: But who else could it be?
[Message 152] MARK: What about you? You were buying Arson by setting a fire at the store, right?
[Message 153] CHLOE: What! No, never! Where did you hear that?
[Message 154] MARK: Someone saw you. I need to know its not true.
[Message 155] CHLOE: No. You’ve got the wrong person.
[Message 156] MARK: I hope so.
[Message 157] CHLOE: What are you implying?
[Message 158] MARK: Nothing. Just... it's a lot to take in.
[Message 159] CHLOE: You think *I* had something to do with it?

[Message 161] CHLOE: Well, that's just great.
[Message 162] MARK: I'm sorry, Chloe.
[Message 163] CHLOE: Whatever.
[Message 164] MARK: Don't be mad.
[Message 165] CHLOE: I'm not mad, I'm just…disappointed.
[Message 166] MARK: Let's just focus on getting to the police tomorrow.
[Message 167] CHLOE: Fine.
[Message 168] MARK: Goodnight.
[Message 169] CHLOE: Night.
[Message 170] LIAM: Hey Mark, you still up?
[Message 171] MARK: Yeah, what's up?
[Message 172] LIAM: I was just thinking… maybe I should just leave town for a while.
[Message 173] MARK: Run away? That's not going to make you look innocent, Liam.
[Message 174] LIAM: I know, I know. But I'm scared.
[Message 175] MARK: Of what?
[Message 176] LIAM: Of getting blamed for something I didn't do. What if she never even called 911 after the fire was started?
[Message 177] MARK: Then you should cooperate with the police. Tell them everything.
[Message 178] LIAM: But what if they don't believe me?
[Message 179] MARK: Then you have to trust the system.
[Message 180] LIAM: Easier said than done.
[Message 181] MARK: I know. But running isn't the answer.
[Message 182] LIAM: Maybe you're right.

[Message 184] LIAM: Thanks, Mark. I needed to hear that.

[Message 189] MARK: Where?
[Message 190] CHLOE: That coffee shop on State Street. In an hour.
[Message 191] MARK: Okay. See you there. We have to be careful about what we tell them.
[Message 192] CHLOE: Exactly. There are a few things that need to be ironed out before we get there

523,"[Message 1] Alex: Morning everyone! Sunrise at the dealership... exciting. Any weekend plans shaping up?
[Message 2] Jordan: Morning! Wedding reception on Saturday. Should be fun.
[Message 3] River: Morning. Wedding sounds nice, Jordan. Nothing concrete for me yet. Maybe some photography.
[Message 4] Kai: Morning! Ugh, data analysis project due Monday. Weekend will be spent staring at a screen.
[Message 5] Alex: Oh no, Kai! That sounds rough. Wedding reception, huh Jordan? Whose wedding?
[Message 6] Jordan: My cousin's. Big affair, apparently. Open bar!
[Message 7] River: Open bar? Tempting. But I promised myself a sunrise shoot at the beach.
[Message 8] Kai: I'd trade spreadsheets for a sunrise any day.
[Message 9] Alex: Beach sounds lovely, River. I might try and sketch something this weekend if I get the chance.
[Message 10] Jordan: Alex, you still drawing? I haven't seen your stuff in ages!
[Message 11] Alex: I dabble. Mostly for myself, you know?
[Message 12] River: You should share sometime, Alex! I'd love to see your work.
[Message 13] Kai: Seconded!
[Message 14] Alex: Maybe, maybe. What kind of photography do you do, River?
[Message 15] River: Mostly landscapes and nature stuff. Trying to capture that perfect light.
[Message 16] Jordan: That's cool. I admire people who can be creative like that.
[Message 17] Kai: Tell me about it. My creativity peaks at finding efficient spreadsheet formulas.
[Message 18] Alex: Haha! We all have our talents, Kai.
[Message 19] Jordan: So, Alex, anything interesting happening at the dealership today?
[Message 20] Alex: Just the usual. Trying to move these cars! We got a new shipment of SUVs.
[Message 21] River: SUVs are practical, I guess. I prefer something smaller and more fuel-efficient.
[Message 22] Kai: Same here. I'm dreaming of an electric car someday.
[Message 23] Alex: Electric cars are the future, for sure.
[Message 24] Jordan: True. So, River, any specific locations in mind for your sunrise shoot?
[Message 25] River: Thinking maybe Haulover Beach. Always a good spot.
[Message 26] Kai: Haulover's beautiful. Hope you get some amazing shots.
[Message 27] Alex: Fingers crossed for good weather!
[Message 28] Jordan: Speaking of weather, what's the forecast for Saturday? Anyone know?
[Message 29] Kai: I think I saw something about possible showers. Check your weather app.
[Message 30] Jordan: Ugh, that would be a bummer. Outdoor wedding.
[Message 31] Alex: Maybe it'll pass quickly.
[Message 32] River: Positive thinking, Alex!
[Message 33] Kai: Optimism is always welcome.
[Message 34] Jordan: Okay, checking the app... says ""partly cloudy with a chance of showers."" So, ambiguous.
[Message 35] Alex: Well, come prepared just in case, Jordan.
[Message 36] Jordan: Definitely. Umbrella and a backup outfit.
[Message 37] River: Smart thinking!
[Message 38] Kai: Always be prepared!
[Message 39] Alex: Exactly. So, anyone got any fun plans besides work, weddings, and photography?
[Message 40] Jordan: Maybe a movie night if the weather's bad.
[Message 41] River: Ooh, what movie?
[Message 42] Kai: I'm open to suggestions.
[Message 43] Alex: I haven't been to the movies in ages. What's good?
[Message 44] Jordan: I heard that new sci-fi movie is supposed to be decent.
[Message 45] River: Sci-fi is always a good option.
[Message 46] Kai: I'm in!
[Message 47] Alex: Sounds good to me.
[Message 48] Jordan: Okay, tentatively penciled in for Saturday night.
[Message 49] River: Awesome!
[Message 50] Kai: Great!
[Message 51] Alex: Perfect.
[Message 52] Jordan: Back to work, I guess.
[Message 53] River: Yep, gotta go edit some photos.
[Message 54] Kai: Back to the spreadsheets...
[Message 55] Alex: And I'll be here selling cars! Have a good day, everyone!
[Message 56] Jordan: You too, Alex!
[Message 57] River: Later!
[Message 58] Kai: Bye!
[Message 59] Alex: Hey again, everyone. Slow day here. Anyone else bored?
[Message 60] Jordan: Slightly less bored than I was this morning, but still bored. Teacher life.
[Message 61] River: Edited all the sunrise photos. Now I'm just browsing art websites.
[Message 62] Kai: Still staring at spreadsheets. Send help.
[Message 63] Alex: Art websites? Anything interesting, River?
[Message 64] River: Some really cool abstract stuff. Thinking about trying something new with my photography.
[Message 65] Jordan: Experimentation is good!
[Message 66] Kai: Keeps things interesting.
[Message 67] Alex: Absolutely. Maybe you could incorporate some drawing techniques, River.
[Message 68] River: That's an interesting idea, Alex.
[Message 69] Jordan: A collaboration!
[Message 70] Kai: Now that's what I call creative.
[Message 71] Alex: Just a thought!
[Message 72] River: I'll have to think about it.
[Message 73] Jordan: So, Kai, what kind of data are you analyzing? If you can even talk about it.
[Message 74] Kai: Nothing too exciting. Sales figures, mostly.
[Message 75] Alex: Always important!
[Message 76] River: Numbers never lie, right?
[Message 77] Kai: Sometimes they're misleading! Depends how you present them.
[Message 78] Jordan: True. Statistics can be manipulated.
[Message 79] Alex: Always good to be skeptical.
[Message 80] River: Indeed.
[Message 81] Kai: Exactly.
[Message 82] Jordan: Anyway, I should probably get back to grading papers.
[Message 83] River: Good luck!
[Message 84] Kai: Have fun! (said sarcastically)
[Message 85] Alex: You got this, Jordan!
[Message 86] Jordan: Thanks, guys!
[Message 87] Alex: Just thinking…anyone ever been to the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens?
[Message 88] Jordan: I went years ago! It's beautiful.
[Message 89] River: Never been, but I've heard great things.
[Message 90] Kai: Me neither. Should we all go sometime?
[Message 91] Alex: That would be fun!
[Message 92] Jordan: I'm in!
[Message 93] River: Count me in too!
[Message 94] Kai: Awesome!
[Message 95] Alex: Let's plan it! Maybe next weekend?
[Message 96] Jordan: Sounds good to me.
[Message 97] River: I'm free next weekend.
[Message 98] Kai: Me too!
[Message 99] Alex: Perfect! We'll figure out the details later.
[Message 100] Jordan: Great!
[Message 101] River: Looking forward to it!
[Message 102] Kai: Me too!
[Message 103] Alex: Okay, back to selling cars. Someone buy one, please!
[Message 104] Jordan: I wish I could afford a new one!
[Message 105] River: Maybe someday!
[Message 106] Kai: My current car is holding on by a thread.
[Message 107] Alex: I hear you.
[Message 108] Jordan: Time for me to actually grade those papers now. Bye!
[Message 109] River: Bye!
[Message 110] Kai: Good luck!
[Message 111] Alex: See ya!
[Message 112] Alex: Evening everyone! How was the rest of your day?
[Message 113] River: Productive! Got some new equipment.
[Message 114] Kai: Still alive. Barely.
[Message 115] Jordan: Made it through the grading. Feeling victorious.
[Message 116] Alex: New equipment, River? What did you get?
[Message 117] River: A new lens! Super excited to try it out at the Vizcaya Museum next week.
[Message 118] Jordan: Perfect timing!
[Message 119] Kai: Sounds awesome!
[Message 120] Alex: Oh nice! What kind of lens?
[Message 121] River: A wide-angle. Should be great for capturing the architecture.
[Message 122] Jordan: Oh, definitely!
[Message 123] Kai: Excellent choice.
[Message 124] Alex: Cool! I might bring my sketchbook next weekend then.
[Message 125] Jordan: Great idea, Alex!
[Message 126] River: We can have a little art session!
[Message 127] Kai: That sounds fun!
[Message 128] Alex: Yeah! Should be a good time.
[Message 129] Jordan: I'll just be there for moral support. And snacks.
[Message 130] River: Snacks are always welcome!
[Message 131] Kai: Moral support is important too!
[Message 132] Alex: Absolutely! We appreciate it, Jordan.
[Message 133] Jordan: You're welcome!
[Message 134] River: So, Kai, are you still drowning in data?
[Message 135] Kai: Slowly but surely making progress. The end is in sight!
[Message 136] Jordan: Keep going!
[Message 137] Alex: You can do it!
[Message 138] River: We believe in you!
[Message 139] Kai: Thanks, guys! I need all the encouragement I can get.
[Message 140] Jordan: So, what's everyone having for dinner tonight?
[Message 141] River: Probably leftovers.
[Message 142] Kai: Ramen. The classic data analyst meal.
[Message 143] Alex: I'm thinking pizza.
[Message 144] Jordan: Pizza sounds good! I might order takeout.
[Message 145] River: Treat yourself!
[Message 146] Kai: You deserve it after grading all those papers.
[Message 147] Alex: Agreed!
[Message 148] Jordan: Okay, you've convinced me. Pizza it is!
[Message 149] River: Enjoy!
[Message 150] Kai: Bon appétit!
[Message 151] Alex: Have a good meal, Jordan!
[Message 152] Jordan: Thanks! You too, Alex!
[Message 153] River: Later!
[Message 154] Kai: Bye!
[Message 155] Alex: Well, I think I'm going to head home. Long day.
[Message 156] Jordan: Have a good night, Alex!
[Message 157] River: Drive safe!
[Message 158] Kai: See ya!
[Message 159] Alex: You too, everyone. Thanks for the company!
[Message 160] Jordan: Anytime!
[Message 161] River: Always a pleasure!
[Message 162] Kai: Bye!
[Message 163] River: Anyone else watching the sunset? It's gorgeous tonight.
[Message 164] Jordan: Wish I was! Still stuck inside.
[Message 165] Kai: Me too. Windowless office.
[Message 166] Alex: Just got home, but I can see it from my balcony. It is pretty spectacular.
[Message 167] River: Definitely a good way to end the day.
[Message 168] Jordan: I'll have to check it out later online!
[Message 169] Kai: Maybe River will share some photos.
[Message 170] River: Of course!
[Message 171] Jordan: Thanks, River!
[Message 172] Kai: Appreciated!
[Message 173] River: No problem! Just doing my part to spread the beauty.
[Message 174] Jordan: You're a true artist!
[Message 175] Kai: Indeed!
[Message 176] Alex: Agreed!
[Message 177] River: Haha, thanks guys!
[Message 178] Jordan: Well, goodnight everyone!
[Message 179] River: Goodnight!
[Message 180] Kai: Night!
[Message 181] Alex: Sleep well!
[Message 182] Jordan: You too!
[Message 183] River: Sweet dreams!
[Message 184] Kai: Zzzzzzz...
[Message 185] Alex: Good night!",0,
524,"[Message 1] Kai: Morning everyone! Anyone catch a good movie lately?
[Message 2] Rowan: Morning Kai! I actually just saw ""Everything Everywhere All at Once."" Blew my mind.
[Message 3] Alex: Rowan, I've heard great things! Is it really that good?
[Message 4] Rowan: Alex, honestly, yes. It's a wild ride, but so worth it. Prepare to think.
[Message 5] Jamie: Morning all! I'm more of a classic film person myself. Just re-watched ""Casablanca."" Timeless.
[Message 6] Jordan: Jamie, you always have the best taste! I need to expand my classic film knowledge.
[Message 7] Kai: I saw the new Marvel movie. Pretty standard fare, honestly. Fun, but forgettable.
[Message 8] Alex: Which Marvel one, Kai? There are so many!
[Message 9] Kai: ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.""
[Message 10] Jordan: I've been meaning to see that. How were the visuals?
[Message 11] Kai: The visuals were great, as always. Just the story felt a bit recycled.
[Message 12] Rowan: Maybe we should have a movie night sometime? Everyone bring a suggestion!
[Message 13] Jamie: That sounds fun, Rowan!
[Message 14] Alex: I'm in!
[Message 15] Jordan: Count me in too!
[Message 16] Kai: I’m game!
[Message 17] Rowan: Great! We can figure out logistics later. Back to movies… Anyone excited about the new Wes Anderson film?
[Message 18] Jamie: Oh yes! I love Wes Anderson. The trailers look fantastic.
[Message 19] Alex: He has such a distinctive style. You either love it or hate it, I think.
[Message 20] Kai: I enjoy his films, but sometimes they feel a little *too* stylized.
[Message 21] Jordan: I'm with Kai on that one. It can feel a bit much sometimes.
[Message 22] Rowan: Fair enough. What other directors do you all admire?
[Message 23] Alex: I'm a big fan of Greta Gerwig. ""Little Women"" was amazing.
[Message 24] Jamie: I agree, Alex! Gerwig is incredibly talented.
[Message 25] Kai: I'm a fan of Bong Joon-ho. ""Parasite"" was a masterpiece.
[Message 26] Jordan: Absolutely! ""Parasite"" was brilliant.
[Message 27] Rowan: Good choices everyone! Okay, slightly off-topic, but did anyone hear back from the parent-teacher meeting requests?
[Message 28] Kai: Not yet, Rowan. Still waiting to see if I need to go.
[Message 29] Alex: Me neither. Fingers crossed it's nothing major.
[Message 30] Jamie: I haven't heard anything either. Maybe no news is good news?
[Message 31] Jordan: Let's hope so!
[Message 32] Rowan: Yeah, let's get back to movies before the parent-teacher anxiety kicks in. What's the best movie soundtrack of all time?
[Message 33] Jamie: Oh, that's a tough one! I'm partial to ""The Graduate.""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Pulp Fiction"" has an iconic soundtrack.
[Message 35] Kai: I’d say “Singles”. Early 90s grunge at its finest.
[Message 36] Jordan: Ooh, good one, Kai!
[Message 37] Rowan: Excellent choices everyone! Music can make or break a film, right?
[Message 38] Alex: Totally!
[Message 39] Jamie: Absolutely!
[Message 40] Kai: Agreed.
[Message 41] Jordan: Definitely.
[Message 42] Rowan: What’s a movie you watched as a kid that still holds up today?
[Message 43] Jamie: ""The Wizard of Oz."" Still magical.
[Message 44] Alex: ""The Princess Bride."" Inconceivable!
[Message 45] Kai: ""E.T."" Still makes me tear up.
[Message 46] Jordan: ""Back to the Future."" Timeless fun!
[Message 47] Rowan: Those are all great! Nostalgia is powerful.
[Message 48] Jamie: It really is.
[Message 49] Alex: So true.
[Message 50] Kai: For sure.
[Message 51] Jordan: Yep.
[Message 52] Rowan: Anyone ever walk out of a movie?
[Message 53] Jamie: I walked out of ""Battlefield Earth."" It was that bad.
[Message 54] Alex: Oh wow, Jamie! That must have been really awful. I've never walked out, but I've considered it.
[Message 55] Kai: I almost walked out of a really boring art film once.
[Message 56] Jordan: I nearly walked out of that last ""Transformers"" movie. So long and repetitive.
[Message 57] Rowan: Haha, yeah those are good candidates for walking out. What movie surprised you the most?
[Message 58] Jamie: ""The Sixth Sense."" That twist!
[Message 59] Alex: ""Arrival."" Beautiful and thought-provoking.
[Message 60] Kai: ""Psycho."" Didn’t expect the lead to die halfway through!
[Message 61] Jordan: ""Knives Out."" Such a clever whodunit.
[Message 62] Rowan: Great answers! Surprises are what make movies exciting.
[Message 63] Jamie: Absolutely.
[Message 64] Alex: Agreed.
[Message 65] Kai: Yep.
[Message 66] Jordan: True.
[Message 67] Rowan: Okay, last movie question for now… what’s a movie you think is overrated?
[Message 68] Jamie: Hmm… maybe ""Avatar."" Visually stunning, but the story was predictable.
[Message 69] Alex: I'd say ""La La Land."" Pretty, but didn't live up to the hype for me.
[Message 70] Kai: I'm going to say ""The Godfather."" I know, sacrilege! Just couldn't get into it.
[Message 71] Jordan: I agree with Kai.
[Message 72] Jordan: I found it very boring!
[Message 73] Rowan: Woah, controversial opinions! It's all subjective, though.
[Message 74] Jamie: Exactly!
[Message 75] Alex: Precisely!
[Message 76] Kai: Yep!
[Message 77] Jordan: True!
[Message 78] Rowan: Okay, back to real life… anyone got weekend plans?
[Message 79] Jamie: Thinking of visiting a museum.
[Message 80] Alex: I'm planning a picnic in the park.
[Message 81] Kai: I have a pottery class to go to.
[Message 82] Jordan: I'm going hiking.
[Message 83] Rowan: Sounds like fun weekends all around! I'm just going to relax at home.
[Message 84] Jamie: Sometimes that's the best plan.
[Message 85] Alex: Totally agree.
[Message 86] Kai: Absolutely.
[Message 87] Jordan: Yep.
[Message 88] Rowan: Anyone seen any good documentaries lately?
[Message 89] Jamie: I watched one about climate change. Pretty sobering.
[Message 90] Alex: I saw one about the history of bread. Fascinating!
[Message 91] Kai: I watched one on the art of bonsai. Very calming.
[Message 92] Jordan: I saw one about competitive dog grooming. Surprisingly intense.
[Message 93] Rowan: Wow, those are all interesting topics! I need to expand my documentary viewing.
[Message 94] Jamie: Definitely!
[Message 95] Alex: You should!
[Message 96] Kai: They’re great!
[Message 97] Jordan: Agree!
[Message 98] Rowan: Okay, enough about documentaries. What's the most ridiculous movie plot you've ever heard of?
[Message 99] Jamie: ""Sharknado."" Enough said.
[Message 100] Alex: Any of the ""Fast and Furious"" movies after, like, the fifth one. They defy physics.
[Message 101] Kai: I can’t stop laughing.
[Message 102] Kai: “Attack of the Killer Tomatoes”.
[Message 103] Jordan: ""Rubber."" A movie about a sentient tire that kills people.
[Message 104] Rowan: Those are all amazing! Ridiculousness can be entertaining.
[Message 105] Jamie: True!
[Message 106] Alex: Definitely!
[Message 107] Kai: For sure!
[Message 108] Jordan: Yep!
[Message 109] Rowan: Okay, time for another random question... what's your favorite type of flower?
[Message 110] Jamie: Roses. Classic and beautiful.
[Message 111] Alex: Sunflowers. So cheerful.
[Message 112] Kai: Orchids. Elegant and exotic.
[Message 113] Jordan: Lavender. Smells amazing.
[Message 114] Rowan: I love lilies. They’re so fragrant.
[Message 115] Jamie: Lovely choices, everyone!
[Message 116] Alex: Agreed!
[Message 117] Kai: Beautiful!
[Message 118] Jordan: Fantastic!
[Message 119] Rowan: What's your go-to movie snack?
[Message 120] Jamie: Popcorn, always.
[Message 121] Alex: Nachos with all the toppings.
[Message 122] Kai: Milk Duds.
[Message 123] Jordan: Sour Patch Kids.
[Message 124] Rowan: Chocolate-covered pretzels. Sweet and salty perfection.
[Message 125] Jamie: Yum!
[Message 126] Alex: Sounds delicious!
[Message 127] Kai: Great choices.
[Message 128] Jordan: Agree!
[Message 129] Rowan: Okay, last question for now… what’s a movie sequel you actually liked?
[Message 130] Jamie: ""The Empire Strikes Back.""
[Message 131] Alex: ""Toy Story 2.""
[Message 132] Kai: ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day.""
[Message 133] Jordan: ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.""
[Message 134] Rowan: Those are all excellent sequels! Hard to top the originals, but sometimes they do.
[Message 135] Jamie: Very true!
[Message 136] Alex: Agreed!
[Message 137] Kai: Exactly!
[Message 138] Jordan: Yep!
[Message 139] Rowan: Alright, I need to head out. Thanks for the fun movie chat!
[Message 140] Jamie: Bye Rowan! Thanks for starting the conversation.
[Message 141] Alex: Later, Rowan!
[Message 142] Kai: See ya!
[Message 143] Jordan: Bye!
[Message 144] Alex: Anyone else still around?
[Message 145] Jamie: I am! Just finishing up my coffee.
[Message 146] Kai: Still here. Waiting for a call.
[Message 147] Jordan: Me too!
[Message 148] Alex: Cool! Anyone have any interesting news lately?
[Message 149] Jamie: Not much, just trying to stay cool in this heat.
[Message 150] Kai: Same here. It’s brutal out there already.
[Message 151] Jordan: I know, right? I'm thinking of getting a small fan for my desk.
[Message 152] Alex: Good idea, Jordan!
[Message 153] Jamie: Definitely a good investment.
[Message 154] Kai: Smart.
[Message 155] Alex: Well, I should probably get back to work. Have a good day, everyone!
[Message 156] Jamie: You too, Alex!
[Message 157] Kai: Have a good one!
[Message 158] Jordan: Bye Alex!
[Message 159] Jamie: Anyone watching the game tonight?
[Message 160] Kai: What game?
[Message 161] Jordan: The Dodgers game.
[Message 162] Jamie: Oh, I might catch some of it.
[Message 163] Kai: I’ll pass. Not a big baseball fan.
[Message 164] Jordan: Fair enough.
[Message 165] Jamie: Well, I should get going too. Talk to you all later!
[Message 166] Kai: Later, Jamie!
[Message 167] Jordan: Bye!
[Message 168] Kai: Guess I’m the last one here.
[Message 169] Kai: Signing off! Have a good day, Jordan!
[Message 170] Jordan: You too, Kai! Bye!",0,
525,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Ugh, another late night at the court. These lights are terrible.""
[Message 2] Riley: ""Tell me about it. Makes it hard to see the lines.""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Seriously. You'd think OKC could invest in some decent lighting for public courts.""
[Message 4] Riley: ""Budget cuts, probably. Everything's getting squeezed these days.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""True. Speaking of squeezed, this orange juice I brought is awful. Too pulpy.""
[Message 6] Riley: ""Haha, first world problems! I can't stand pulp, either.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""It's just… unnecessarily textured. Anyway, back to the lighting, maybe we should petition the city?""

[Message 9] Alex: ""Yeah, you're probably right. Still, it's annoying.""
[Message 10] Riley: ""What's more annoying is this new investment strategy my boss is pushing. It's so convoluted.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Oh, really? What's the gist of it?""
[Message 12] Riley: ""Something about leveraging… synthetic… derivatives. It makes my head spin.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Sounds… complicated. I prefer a simple béchamel sauce. That's all you really need in life.""
[Message 14] Riley: ""Haha, you and your sauces! So, restaurant still keeping you busy?""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Busy is an understatement. Understaffed, overpriced, and constantly complaining customers.""
[Message 16] Riley: ""Ouch. Sounds like a recipe for disaster.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""It is. I swear, people complain about the smallest things. One woman complained that her potatoes were too… potatoey.""
[Message 18] Riley: ""Too potatoey? Seriously? What does that even mean?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Exactly! I wanted to ask her if she expected them to taste like chicken.""
[Message 20] Riley: ""Restraint, Alex, restraint. Think of the Yelp reviews!""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Ugh, Yelp. Another source of endless complaints.""
[Message 22] Riley: ""Hey, on the bright side, at least it gives you something to talk about.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""True. Misery loves company, and Yelp is basically a misery convention.""

[Message 27] Alex: ""Never! It's just… thematically appropriate, given my current state of potato-related rage.""
[Message 28] Riley: ""Fair enough. Speaking of rage, I almost keyed someone's car today. Parked like a complete idiot.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Oh, wow. Close call. What kind of car was it?""
[Message 30] Riley: ""A massive, lifted pickup truck. Taking up two spaces.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Those guys are the worst. Entitled parking is a societal plague.""
[Message 32] Riley: ""It is! I just… walked away. Needed to keep my job. Financial analysts who key cars don't get promoted.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Wise decision. Although, the image of you keying a pickup truck is pretty amusing.""
[Message 34] Riley: ""Don't encourage me! I'm already plotting my revenge in my head.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""Okay, okay. Let's talk about something less… vehicular-assault-y. How's your sister doing?""
[Message 36] Riley: ""She's good! Just started a new pottery class. Seems to be enjoying it.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Pottery! That's cool. Always wanted to try that.""
[Message 38] Riley: ""You should! It's supposed to be very therapeutic. Less stressful than dealing with 'potatoey' potato complaints.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Definitely. Although, I might accidentally sculpt a giant, angry potato.""
[Message 40] Riley: ""Haha! I'd buy it. Especially if it had tiny, menacing eyes.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""I'll put it on Etsy. 'Angery Potato: A Culinary Nightmare.'""
[Message 42] Riley: ""Perfect! Okay, back to business stuff – I think I'm going to push back on this synthetic derivative garbage.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Good for you! Stand your ground. Don't let them force you into complicated, risky financial maneuvers.""
[Message 44] Riley: ""Easier said than done. My boss is… persuasive.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Ugh, persuasive bosses are the worst. Makes me thankful I'm my own boss, even if it means dealing with potato complaints.""
[Message 46] Riley: ""True freedom. I envy you, Alex.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Don't envy the complaining. It's a constant battle against the forces of unreasonable expectations.""
[Message 48] Riley: ""I hear you. It's the same in finance. Everyone wants maximum returns with zero risk. Doesn't work that way!""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Exactly! You can't have your cake and eat it too… unless you're willing to pay extra for a really good cake.""
[Message 50] Riley: ""And even then, someone will complain that the frosting is too sweet.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Precisely! The cycle of complaint is eternal.""
[Message 52] Riley: ""So, you think this city will ever fix these lights?""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Doubtful. We're doomed to play basketball in perpetual twilight.""
[Message 54] Riley: ""Optimistic as always.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Hey, someone has to be the voice of reason… or, you know, pessimism.""
[Message 56] Riley: ""Fair enough. Well, I'm getting cold. Think I'm gonna head home.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Yeah, me too. These shadows are starting to freak me out.""
[Message 58] Riley: ""Agreed. Night, Alex.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Night, Riley. Try not to dream about synthetic derivatives.""
[Message 60] Riley: ""I'll try my best. Maybe I'll dream of pottery instead.""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Better idea. Or angry potatoes.""
[Message 62] Riley: ""Okay, okay, I get it. Good night!""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Good night!""
[Message 64] Riley: ""Drive safe.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""You too.""
[Message 66] Riley: ""Just got home. Ugh, still thinking about work.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""That's the worst. Need a distraction.""
[Message 68] Riley: ""Any suggestions?""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Start sculpting that angry potato in your mind. Give it tiny, pointy teeth.""
[Message 70] Riley: ""Haha! Okay, I'm trying. It's… kind of working.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Good! Channel your inner rage into artistic expression.""
[Message 72] Riley: ""Maybe I'll write a complaint letter… to my boss. Just kidding… mostly.""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Don't do it! Think of the consequences!""
[Message 74] Riley: ""Yeah, yeah, I know. But the temptation is real.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""Resist! Embrace the potato! Become one with the spud!""
[Message 76] Riley: ""You're officially losing it, Alex.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Maybe. But at least I'm not thinking about synthetic derivatives.""
[Message 78] Riley: ""True. Okay, I'm gonna watch some mindless TV. Brain needs to turn off.""
[Message 79] Alex: ""Sounds like a plan. I might do some sketching. Perhaps… a potato.""
[Message 80] Riley: ""You're obsessed. Goodnight, Potato Artist.""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Goodnight, Future Pottery Enthusiast.""

[Message 87] Riley: ""Haha! I knew you'd say something else. And yeah, it does look pretty bright.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""Maybe it's reflecting the angry potato energy.""
[Message 89] Riley: ""Okay, I'm officially blocking your number. Good night!""
[Message 90] Alex: ""No, wait! I have a serious question about…""
[Message 91] Riley: ""Don't you dare say 'potatoes.'""
[Message 92] Alex: ""…about the city budget. Do you think they actually prioritize infrastructure?""
[Message 93] Riley: ""Okay, okay, you redeemed yourself. And honestly, I have no idea. Probably not.""

[Message 95] Riley: ""Exactly! Okay, *now* good night.""

[Message 4] Eleanor: ""Not at all! Keeps us cozy inside. Did you see the news? They said it might clear up later.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Fingers crossed! I was thinking of going for a drive later, maybe check out that classic car show.""
[Message 6] Eleanor: ""A car show? How fun! My knees wouldn't let me stand for long, though.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Ah, that's a bummer. I'll take pictures! What are you up to after bowling, Eleanor?""
[Message 8] Eleanor: ""Volunteering at the community center, helping with the garden. Rain or shine!""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Dedication! I admire that. Okay, my turn! Hope I don't gutterball.""

[Message 12] Eleanor: ""Anytime, dear. So, back to the weather, have you been to that new coffee shop downtown?""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Bean Scene? Yeah, went there last week. Pretty good latte, but kinda crowded.""
[Message 14] Eleanor: ""Oh, I was thinking of trying it. Is it noisy?""
[Message 15] Alex: ""A bit, yeah. Music's a little loud too. But the pastries looked amazing. I resisted!""
[Message 16] Eleanor: ""Resisted? Good for you! I need to watch my sugar intake.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Easier said than done when there's a giant chocolate croissant staring you down.""
[Message 18] Eleanor: ""Haha, I know the feeling! Maybe we can try it together sometime, a little coffee date.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""I'd be down for that! When the sun's out, maybe? We can sit outside.""
[Message 20] Eleanor: ""Perfect! We'll plan it. Now, focus on those pins!""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Right, right. Gotta concentrate. This weather's making me scatterbrained.""
[Message 22] Eleanor: ""Just breathe, Alex. And enjoy the game! It's about having fun, not winning.""

[Message 30] Eleanor: ""Snow? Oh, I hope not! I'm not a fan of driving in the snow.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Me neither. Though, a blanket of snow does look pretty. Just not on the roads.""
[Message 32] Eleanor: ""Exactly! It's beautiful from the window with a cup of hot cocoa.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""Definitely. I'll take winter if it means cozy nights in. Summer can be so overrated.""

[Message 36] Eleanor: ""Yes, please! You're a lifesaver. This weather is making me sleepy.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""No problem! I'm starting to feel it too. Maybe we should move to the tropics?""
[Message 38] Eleanor: ""Haha, that's tempting! But I'd miss my garden and my volunteering.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""True. Gotta find that balance, right? Warm weather and good deeds.""
[Message 40] Eleanor: ""Exactly! Speaking of good deeds, did you hear about Mrs. Gable's bake sale?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Mrs. Gable? The one who makes the legendary lemon bars?""
[Message 42] Eleanor: ""The very same! It's to raise money for the animal shelter.""

[Message 44] Eleanor: ""Wonderful! It's Saturday morning. I'll be there bright and early.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Cool! I'll see you there, then. Back to the bowling?""
[Message 46] Eleanor: ""Indeed! Let's see if we can knock down some more pins before this rain lets up.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Alright! Challenge accepted. I'm aiming for a strike this time.""
[Message 48] Eleanor: ""I'll be cheering you on! Even if it's just a spare, I'll be happy.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""You're the best, Eleanor. Thanks for being such a positive influence.""

[Message 5] Ben: Yeah, crazy. Poor Mrs. Davison. Heartbreaking.
[Message 6] Ben: I was there in the morning for donuts.
[Message 7] Liam: Really? I was around there Late Afternoon. Needed to grab a loaf of bread.

[Message 102] Chloe: I hope you're right.
[Message 103] Liam: Look, I gotta go. Early shift tomorrow.
[Message 104] Chloe: Okay. Thanks for listening.
[Message 105] Liam: No problem. Sleep well.
[Message 106] Chloe: You too.
[Message 107] Chloe: Hey, did you know Ben recently ended a long-term abusive relationship?
[Message 108] Liam: No, I didn't. That's rough.
[Message 109] Chloe: Yeah, with a woman named Alicia. Maybe it's nothing, but…
[Message 110] Liam: I don't see what that has to do with anything.
[Message 111] Chloe: Maybe he was talking about hurting someone right before he went over to the Bakery. You never know
[Message 112] Liam: I highly doubt that. But I'll keep it in mind.
[Message 113] Chloe: Thanks. I just have a bad feeling.
[Message 114] Liam: Try to relax, okay?
[Message 115] Chloe: I will. Goodnight.
[Message 116] Liam: Night.
[Message 117] Alicia: Hey Ben, you okay? You haven't been answering my calls.
[Message 118] Ben: Hey Alicia, sorry, I've been busy.
[Message 119] Alicia: Busy doing what?
[Message 120] Ben: Just… stuff. Don't worry about it.
[Message 121] Alicia: Is it about what I said? About us never getting back together?
[Message 122] Ben: No, it's not about you.
[Message 123] Alicia: Then what is it? You're scaring me.
[Message 124] Ben: Look, I can't talk right now. I'll call you later.
[Message 125] Alicia: No, tell me now! I deserve to know.
[Message 126] Ben: I just need some space. Okay?
[Message 127] Alicia: Fine. But don't expect me to be here when you're ready to talk.
[Message 128] Ben: Whatever.
[Message 129] Alicia: You always hated me, didn't you?
[Message 130] Ben: Goodbye, Alicia.
[Message 131] Alicia: Ugh.
[Message 132] Ben: Hey Liam, I need to ask you something.
[Message 133] Liam: What's up?
[Message 134] Ben: If someone… hypothetically… did something really bad, would you help them cover it up?
[Message 135] Liam: Depends on what it is. And who it is.
[Message 136] Ben: Just a hypothetical!
[Message 137] Liam: Still depends. I'm not going to incriminate myself.
[Message 138] Ben: So you wouldn't help me?
[Message 139] Liam: I didn't say that. But I need to know what we're talking about.
[Message 140] Ben: Forget it. Never mind.
[Message 141] Liam: Fine. But don't come crying to me if you get caught.
[Message 142] Ben: I won't.
[Message 143] Chloe: Liam, Ben just texted me saying he ""intends"" to leave town soon.
[Message 144] Liam: What? Seriously?
[Message 145] Chloe: Yeah. I'm really scared now.
[Message 146] Liam: Okay, look. We need to call the police.
[Message 147] Chloe: Are you sure?
[Message 148] Liam: Yes. This is beyond weird. And honestly, if he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.
[Message 149] Chloe: Okay, I'm calling them now.
[Message 150] Liam: Good. Tell them everything.
[Message 151] Chloe: I will. Thanks, Liam.
[Message 152] Liam: No problem. Be safe.
[Message 153] Chloe: You too.
[Message 154] Liam: This is crazy.
[Message 155] Ben: Hey Liam, they are looking for a guy with calloused hands. I knew you worked out a lot.
[Message 156] Liam: What?! Why are you telling me this?
[Message 157] Ben: Just saying, be careful.
[Message 158] Liam: Are you trying to frame me?
[Message 159] Ben: No! Just… looking out for you.

[Message 2] Ben: ""Nitro Surge? Haven't heard of it. What's it like?""
[Message 3] Chris: ""I think I saw a trailer. Looked pretty intense, lots of customization options.""
[Message 4] Dana: ""Customization? That’s always a plus. Is it realistic or more arcade-style?""
[Message 5] Alex: ""From what I've read, leaning towards arcade-style but with some sim elements. Ben, you'd probably like the investing aspects in the car upgrades, haha!""
[Message 6] Ben: ""Investing in car upgrades in a video game? Sounds right up my alley! I’ll check it out.""
[Message 7] Chris: ""I’m more of a narrative game person myself. Anything interesting coming out story-wise?""
[Message 8] Dana: ""The new ""Eternal Bloom"" is getting good reviews for its storyline, apparently.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Eternal Bloom? What's that about?""
[Message 10] Dana: ""Fantasy RPG, something about saving a dying world. Classic, but reviewers say the writing is top-notch.""
[Message 11] Chris: ""Might give that a look. RPGs can be a good time sink.""
[Message 12] Ben: ""Speaking of time, I need to head out soon. Got a meeting with a new potential tenant tomorrow.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Good luck with that, Ben!""
[Message 14] Chris: ""Yeah, hope it goes well!""
[Message 15] Dana: ""Let us know how it goes.""
[Message 16] Ben: ""Will do! Back to games... anyone tried that old puzzle game, ""Crystalline Maze""?""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Crystalline Maze? Vaguely remember that. Was it any good?""
[Message 18] Chris: ""I remember it being infuriatingly difficult.""
[Message 19] Dana: ""I think my brother used to play that. Gave him headaches.""
[Message 20] Ben: ""Haha, yeah, it’s a brain-burner. But satisfying when you solve a level.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""I'm thinking of picking up Nitro Surge. Anyone want to join me online sometime?""
[Message 22] Chris: ""I might be up for that. What platform are you getting it on?""
[Message 23] Alex: ""PS5. You?""
[Message 24] Chris: ""Same here. Add me: GamerTagX.""
[Message 25] Dana: ""I'm mostly on PC, but I might double-dip for Eternal Bloom. It sounds intriguing.""
[Message 26] Ben: ""I haven't played a PC game in ages. Used to love ""SimCity,"" though.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""SimCity is a classic!""
[Message 28] Chris: ""They've made a few versions since then, Ben. You might be surprised.""
[Message 29] Dana: ""Yeah, the new ones are pretty complex, but fun.""
[Message 30] Ben: ""Maybe I'll check them out. I need something to relax with after a long day of real estate.""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Definitely. Gaming can be a great stress reliever.""
[Message 32] Chris: ""True that.""
[Message 33] Dana: ""Agreed. Speaking of relaxing, has anyone been to that new spa on Grove Street?""
[Message 34] Alex: ""Grove Street Spa? No, haven't heard of it.""
[Message 35] Chris: ""Me neither. Is it any good?""
[Message 36] Dana: ""Apparently, it's amazing. Pricey, but worth it, they say.""
[Message 37] Ben: ""I'll stick to my games for relaxation. Much cheaper!""
[Message 38] Alex: ""Haha, fair enough. Back to Nitro Surge, I'm downloading it now. Should be ready to play in an hour or so.""
[Message 39] Chris: ""Cool. I might be on later tonight. I'll check.""

[Message 44] Dana: ""Bye Ben!""
[Message 45] Alex: ""So, Dana, anything new happening at the pharmacy?""
[Message 46] Dana: ""Same old, same old. Trying to deal with the usual insurance headaches.""
[Message 47] Chris: ""Sounds stressful.""
[Message 48] Dana: ""It is. I'm thinking of repainting my living room this weekend to de-stress.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""What color are you thinking?""
[Message 50] Dana: ""Something calming, maybe a light blue or green.""
[Message 51] Chris: ""Green is a good choice. Very relaxing.""
[Message 52] Alex: ""True. Hey Chris, how's the mentoring of that new chef going?""
[Message 53] Chris: ""It's going okay. He's eager to learn, but still a bit clumsy in the kitchen.""
[Message 54] Dana: ""Patience is key!""
[Message 55] Chris: ""Definitely. Lots of repetition and gentle correction.""
[Message 56] Alex: ""Sounds like a good approach.""
[Message 57] Dana: ""He's lucky to have you as a mentor. You're so patient.""
[Message 58] Chris: ""Thanks, Dana. I try my best.""

[Message 63] Chris: ""So, Dana, still thinking about that spa?""
[Message 64] Dana: ""Maybe. It's tempting.""
[Message 65] Chris: ""You deserve it after dealing with those insurance companies.""
[Message 66] Dana: ""That's true. I might just treat myself.""
[Message 67] Chris: ""You should! Sometimes you need to splurge a little.""
[Message 68] Dana: ""I think I will. Thanks, Chris.""
[Message 69] Chris: ""No problem! Hey, have you tried that new vegan place downtown?""
[Message 70] Dana: ""The ""Green Spoon""? I've heard good things.""
[Message 71] Chris: ""It's fantastic! Even if you're not vegan, the food is delicious.""
[Message 72] Dana: ""I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the recommendation.""
[Message 73] Chris: ""Anytime! I'm thinking of making paella this weekend. It's been a while.""
[Message 74] Dana: ""Ooh, paella sounds amazing! Lucky you!""
[Message 75] Chris: ""Maybe I'll invite some friends over. It's always better to share.""
[Message 76] Dana: ""That sounds like fun! Enjoy!""
[Message 77] Chris: ""Thanks! I will. Well, I should probably get going. Long day tomorrow.""
[Message 78] Dana: ""You too. Get some rest.""
[Message 79] Chris: ""Will do. Talk to you later!""
[Message 80] Dana: ""Bye Chris!""
[Message 81] Dana: ""Hmm, maybe I'll finally start that herb garden I've been planning.""
[Message 82] Dana: ""Now where did I put those seed packets...""
[Message 83] Dana: ""Oh well, guess I'll just watch some tv and relax. ""
[Message 84] Dana: ""Anyone got any good movie suggestions?""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Hey! Sorry, I was in the zone with Nitro Surge. What kind of movies are you in the mood for?""
[Message 86] Dana: ""Something light and funny, I think. Nothing too heavy.""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Have you seen ""Paddington 2""? It's surprisingly heartwarming.""
[Message 88] Dana: ""Paddington 2? I've heard good things! I'll check it out.""
[Message 89] Alex: ""Seriously, it's great. Ben, I bet you'd secretly love it too!""
[Message 90] Dana: ""Haha, I can picture Ben investing in Paddington's marmalade empire.""
[Message 91] Alex: ""Exactly! Anyway, back to racing... these graphics are insane!""
[Message 92] Dana: ""Enjoy the game!""
[Message 93] Alex: ""Thanks! Later!""
[Message 94] Dana: ""Later!""
[Message 95] Ben: ""Just saw the messages! Meeting went well. And Paddington, you say? Hmm...""

531,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone! Ready for another round of book club chat?
[Message 2] Jordan: Yep! Ready when you are.
[Message 3] Casey: Just finishing up dinner, but I'm here!
[Message 4] Alex: Awesome! So, how did we all feel about ""The Grapes of Wrath""?
[Message 5] Jordan: Wow, heavy stuff. Really made me think.
[Message 6] Casey: Brutal but important, I thought. The Dust Bowl was devastating.
[Message 7] Alex: Agreed. The resilience of the Joad family was incredible, though.
[Message 8] Jordan: Absolutely. Talk about community involvement born out of necessity.
[Message 9] Casey: It really highlights the importance of helping each other out, especially in tough times.
[Message 10] Alex: Totally. Makes you think about what community involvement looks like today.
[Message 11] Jordan: I was just reading about a local initiative to plant trees in the park. Pretty cool.
[Message 12] Casey: Oh, I saw that too! Thinking of volunteering.
[Message 13] Alex: That’s fantastic, Casey!
[Message 14] Jordan: You should! It’s a great way to give back.
[Message 15] Casey: What about you two? Any community projects you're involved in?
[Message 16] Alex: I'm on the board of the local library. Trying to get more funding for children's programs.
[Message 17] Jordan: That's awesome, Alex! I’m trying to help out at a senior center, offering tech support.
[Message 18] Casey: Nice! I’m always impressed by people who volunteer their time.
[Message 19] Alex: It's rewarding, definitely. Even small contributions can make a difference.
[Message 20] Jordan: True. Speaking of small contributions… anyone have a good cookie recipe? I'm baking for the senior center next week.
[Message 21] Casey: Haha, nice segue, Jordan! I have a killer chocolate chip recipe.
[Message 22] Alex: Ooh, yes, please share! I'm always looking for new cookie recipes.
[Message 23] Jordan: Perfect! I'll take it. Back to the book, though… did anyone else feel like the ending was a little abrupt?
[Message 24] Casey: Definitely. I was hoping for a bit more closure for the characters.
[Message 25] Alex: Yeah, me too. But maybe that's the point? Life doesn't always have neat endings.
[Message 26] Jordan: Good point, Alex. It’s more realistic that way.
[Message 27] Casey: I guess so. It definitely left me thinking about the long-term effects of poverty and displacement.
[Message 28] Alex: Absolutely. It's a cycle that's hard to break.
[Message 29] Jordan: Which is why community involvement is so important, right? Addressing those systemic issues.
[Message 30] Casey: Exactly. Grassroots efforts can really make a difference.
[Message 31] Alex: I agree. I think it's about empowering people to help themselves.
[Message 32] Jordan: Did anyone else notice the symbolism of the grapes in the book?
[Message 33] Casey: Oh yeah! The potential for abundance and the disappointment when it rots away.
[Message 34] Alex: Exactly! And the idea of ""wrath"" – not just anger, but the consequences of injustice.
[Message 35] Jordan: Deep stuff! Okay, back to less heavy topics...Anyone watching anything good on TV lately?
[Message 36] Casey: Haha, I needed that! I'm obsessed with ""Great British Baking Show."" So soothing.
[Message 37] Alex: Oh, I love that show! I find it so relaxing to watch.
[Message 38] Jordan: I've heard good things! I'm more of a sci-fi person myself. Watching ""The Expanse.""
[Message 39] Casey: I'll have to check that out. Need something new to binge.
[Message 40] Alex: Same here. Always looking for recommendations.
[Message 41] Jordan: So, back to community involvement…besides volunteering, what other ways can people contribute?
[Message 42] Casey: Supporting local businesses is a big one. Keeping money in the community.
[Message 43] Alex: Definitely. And advocating for policies that support vulnerable populations.
[Message 44] Jordan: True. Voting, contacting representatives, that kind of thing.
[Message 45] Casey: Every little bit helps, right?
[Message 46] Alex: Absolutely. It's about creating a more just and equitable society for everyone.
[Message 47] Jordan: Well said, Alex. I'm feeling inspired!
[Message 48] Casey: Me too! Maybe we can all brainstorm some more ideas for local projects we can get involved in.
[Message 49] Alex: That's a great idea, Casey! Let's do it.
[Message 50] Jordan: I'm in! Let's schedule another chat soon.
[Message 51] Casey: Sounds good!
[Message 52] Alex: Perfect. So, anyone else have any thoughts on ""The Grapes of Wrath"" before we move on?
[Message 53] Jordan: I was struck by the portrayal of the government – helpful at times, but also bureaucratic and frustrating.
[Message 54] Casey: Yeah, that's a really important point. The limitations of even well-intentioned systems.
[Message 55] Alex: It highlights the need for individuals to step up and fill the gaps.
[Message 56] Jordan: Exactly. Individual action combined with systemic change.
[Message 57] Casey: I'm also thinking about the role of women in the book. Ma Joad was such a strong figure.
[Message 58] Alex: Absolutely. The backbone of the family, holding everything together.
[Message 59] Jordan: A symbol of resilience and determination.
[Message 60] Casey: She really embodied the spirit of community involvement, in a way.
[Message 61] Alex: Definitely. Protecting her family and helping others along the way.
[Message 62] Jordan: Okay, I think we've pretty much covered the book. Any other business?
[Message 63] Casey: Just wanted to say thanks for organizing this, Alex. It's always a good discussion.
[Message 64] Alex: My pleasure, Casey! I enjoy it too.
[Message 65] Jordan: Me too! It's great to connect with you both.
[Message 66] Alex: So, what book should we read next? Any suggestions?
[Message 67] Jordan: I was thinking maybe something a little lighter this time?
[Message 68] Casey: Agreed! Something a bit more optimistic.
[Message 69] Alex: Okay, any specific ideas? Maybe a feel-good contemporary novel?
[Message 70] Jordan: Ooh, I just read ""Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine."" It's funny and heartwarming.
[Message 71] Casey: I've heard good things about that one!
[Message 72] Alex: That sounds perfect! Let's go with that.
[Message 73] Jordan: Great! I'll make sure to find a copy.
[Message 74] Casey: Me too! Looking forward to it.
[Message 75] Alex: Awesome! I'll send out a reminder in a couple of weeks.
[Message 76] Jordan: Sounds good! Oh, by the way, did either of you see the meteor shower last night?
[Message 77] Casey: No, I missed it! Was it good?
[Message 78] Alex: It was amazing! So many shooting stars.
[Message 79] Jordan: Yeah, it was worth staying up late for.
[Message 80] Casey: I'll have to try to catch the next one.
[Message 81] Alex: Definitely! Keep an eye on the weather forecast.
[Message 82] Jordan: Okay, well, I should probably get going. Early start tomorrow.
[Message 83] Casey: Me too. Thanks for the chat, everyone!
[Message 84] Alex: Thanks, Jordan! Thanks, Casey! Talk to you soon.
[Message 85] Jordan: Bye!
[Message 86] Casey: Bye!
[Message 87] Alex: Before I go, I did just want to say how inspiring I find you two. It's great to have friends so committed to helping others.
[Message 88] Jordan: Aw, thanks Alex! We appreciate you too and all that you do for the library.
[Message 89] Casey: Yeah, Alex, you're a great friend. Thanks for being such a positive force.
[Message 90] Alex: Thanks, you guys. That really means a lot. It's important to surround yourself with good people.
[Message 91] Jordan: Totally agree.
[Message 92] Casey: Absolutely.
[Message 93] Alex: Okay, I'm signing off now. Have a great night, both of you!
[Message 94] Jordan: You too, Alex!
[Message 95] Casey: Sleep well!
[Message 96] Alex: Night!
[Message 97] Jordan: Night!
[Message 98] Casey: Goodnight!
[Message 99] Alex: Just thinking... maybe for one of our community involvement projects, we could organize a book drive for underprivileged schools?
[Message 100] Jordan: That's a great idea, Alex! I'm in.
[Message 101] Casey: Me too! We could even get the library involved.
[Message 102] Alex: Perfect! We'll brainstorm some more next time.
[Message 103] Jordan: Awesome! I'm excited about that.

[Message 4] Alex: So sad. Poor kid.

[Message 6] Jordan: Yeah, that's what I heard.

[Message 7] Alex: Anyone know her? I didn't.

[Message 8] Riley: Nope. Just heard she was always withdrawn.

[Message 9] Jordan: Me neither. But I walk through there every day! Gives me the creeps now.

[Message 11] Riley: So, what now? Everyone’s a detective?

[Message 12] Jordan: Haha, pretty much.

[Message 13] Alex: Just trying to process it, I guess.

[Message 14] Riley: Me too. By the way, Alex, did you ever finish that woodworking project?

[Message 15] Alex: Not yet, been busy. Why?

[Message 16] Riley: Just curious.

[Message 17] Jordan: Omg, I was supposed to meet someone there Late Evening! But they cancelled last minute.

[Message 18] Alex: Whoa, Jordan, that's wild.

[Message 19] Riley: Seriously! Who were you meeting?

[Message 20] Jordan: Just a friend. It's not important now. It's irrelevant.

[Message 65] Riley: True.

[Message 66] Jordan: Hard to say, could be anyone.

[Message 67] Alex: Wonder if they have any witnesses.

[Message 68] Riley: Probably.

[Message 69] Jordan: Hopefully, they catch this person soon.

[Message 70] Alex: Agreed.

[Message 71] Riley: So, Alex, you were out pretty late last night, weren’t you?

[Message 72] Alex: What? Where is this coming from?

[Message 73] Riley: Just asking. I thought I saw you near Sidewalk.

[Message 74] Alex: No, you didn't. I was at home.

[Message 75] Jordan: Whoa, awkward.

[Message 76] Riley: Just saying, Alex. No need to get defensive.

[Message 77] Alex: I'm not defensive! I just wasn't there. End of story.

[Message 78] Jordan: Okay, guys, let’s just calm down.

[Message 79] Riley: Fine by me.

[Message 80] Alex: Yeah, whatever.

[Message 81] Riley: Jordan, did you notice anything strange when you were near Sidewalk earlier? Before your friend cancelled?

[Message 82] Jordan: No, nothing. Just the usual.

[Message 83] Alex: You seem tense.

[Message 84] Jordan: I'm just tired, okay?

[Message 85] Riley: Alright.

[Message 86] Alex: I’m going to bed. This conversation is making me uncomfortable.

[Message 87] Riley: Goodnight.

[Message 88] Jordan: Night.

[Message 89] Riley: So, Jordan. You free to talk?

[Message 90] Jordan: About what?

[Message 91] Riley: Alex. You think he's involved?

[Message 92] Jordan: I don't know, Riley. He was acting weird, but...

[Message 93] Riley: He always hated activists. And he was covering up another crime. What if Sarah knew about it?

[Message 94] Jordan: That's a big accusation, Riley.

[Message 95] Riley: I know, but think about it.

[Message 96] Jordan: I don't want to think about it.

[Message 97] Riley: Okay, okay. Just… keep your eyes open, alright?

[Message 98] Jordan: Fine.

[Message 99] Riley: Good.

[Message 100] Alex: Hey, sorry about earlier. I was just stressed.

[Message 101] Riley: It's alright.

[Message 102] Jordan: Yeah, no worries.

[Message 103] Alex: So, what were you guys talking about after I left?

[Message 104] Riley: Nothing important. Just movie plans.

[Message 105] Jordan: Yeah, nothing.

[Message 106] Alex: Okay. Just curious.

[Message 107] Riley: So, you up for that movie tomorrow now?

[Message 108] Alex: Maybe. Depends on how I feel.

[Message 109] Jordan: Cool.

[Message 110] Riley: Alright.

[Message 111] Alex: This whole situation is just awful. I can’t even imagine what Sarah’s family is going through.

[Message 112] Riley: Yeah, terrible. Hope they give her justice. They're going away for a long time for this

[Message 113] Jordan: Agreed.

[Message 114] Riley: Hey Alex, did you get a new coat recently? Dark colored?

[Message 115] Alex: Yeah, why?

[Message 116] Riley: No reason. Just saw someone wearing one like it the other day.

[Message 117] Alex: Okay.

[Message 118] Jordan: Riley, leave him alone.

[Message 119] Riley: Just making conversation.

[Message 120] Jordan: Sure you are.

[Message 121] Alex: Seriously, what's going on?

[Message 122] Riley: Nothing, Alex. Just forget about it.

[Message 123] Jordan: Yeah, drop it, Alex.

[Message 124] Alex: Fine.

[Message 125] Riley: Jordan, I was thinking... maybe Sarah knew something about your canceled meeting?

[Message 126] Jordan: Absolutely not. Don't even go there. I was aware she's an activist.

[Message 127] Riley: Okay, just a thought.

[Message 128] Jordan: A stupid thought.

[Message 129] Riley: Alright.

[Message 130] Alex: Guys, I'm seriously getting creeped out. Can we talk about something else?

[Message 131] Riley: Sure thing. What do you want to talk about?

[Message 132] Jordan: Anything but this.

[Message 133] Alex: I don't know. Anything.

[Message 134] Riley: How about that woodworking project, Alex? Ever get around to buying Pushing from a height at the store?

[Message 135] Alex: I told you, not yet. Why are you so obsessed with that?

[Message 136] Jordan: Riley, you're being really weird.

[Message 137] Riley: I’m just trying to lighten the mood.

[Message 138] Alex: Well, you're not doing a very good job.

[Message 139] Riley: Alright, alright. I'll stop.

[Message 140] Jordan: Good.

[Message 141] Alex: Thanks.

[Message 142] Riley: Whatever.

[Message 143] Jordan: I’m gonna go for a walk. Need some fresh air.

[Message 144] Alex: Okay. Be careful.

[Message 145] Riley: Yeah, watch out for falling objects. Just kidding!

[Message 146] Jordan: Not funny, Riley.

[Message 147] Riley: Sorry, sorry.

[Message 148] Alex: Seriously, stop it, Riley.

[Message 149] Riley: Fine, I’m done.

[Message 150] Alex: Good. I'm going offline.",1,

[Message 2] Jamie: ""Hey Alex! I'm thinking about it. What are you planning to grow?""
[Message 3] River: ""Morning! I'm in too, Alex. Thinking tomatoes and maybe some herbs this year.""
[Message 4] Sam: ""Morning all. Not much of a gardener myself, but I admire those who are.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Jamie, I'm thinking tomatoes, peppers, and maybe some zucchini. River, tomatoes and herbs are a great combo!""
[Message 6] Jamie: ""Zucchini is a classic. You'll be giving it away to everyone you know by August, haha.""

[Message 9] Alex: ""That's a good point, Sam! Not yet. I was thinking about going to the coast later in the summer.""

[Message 11] River: ""I'm hoping to visit my family back east. Haven't seen them in ages.""
[Message 12] Sam: ""East coast is lovely. Lots of history there.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Alright, back to gardening! Anyone have a preferred brand of potting soil?""
[Message 14] Jamie: ""I usually just grab whatever's on sale. Does it really make that much of a difference?""
[Message 15] River: ""I've heard good things about Miracle-Gro, but it can be pricey.""
[Message 16] Sam: ""My neighbor swears by composting his own soil. Says it's the best.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Composting is definitely the way to go! I'm just not consistent enough with it. I'll look for Miracle-Gro. Thanks, River.""
[Message 18] Jamie: ""Composting sounds like a lot of work!""
[Message 19] River: ""It is a bit, but apparently the results are worth it.""
[Message 20] Sam: ""My neighbor seems to enjoy it. He's always out there tinkering.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Anyone have tips for keeping squirrels away from tomatoes?""
[Message 22] Jamie: ""Oh man, squirrels are the worst! I've heard peppermint oil can help.""
[Message 23] River: ""I've tried netting. It works okay, but it's not the prettiest.""

[Message 25] Alex: ""Peppermint oil and netting... I'll give those a try. Thanks!""

[Message 29] Alex: ""Alright, I'm grabbing some seeds. Anyone have any recommendations for heirloom tomatoes?""
[Message 30] Jamie: ""Never grown heirloom tomatoes. Are they harder to grow?""
[Message 31] River: ""They can be a bit more finicky, but the flavor is amazing! Cherokee Purple is a good one to start with.""

[Message 48] Sam: ""Lavender is supposed to be good for relaxation, right?""
[Message 49] Alex: ""That's what I've heard, Sam. River, good to know it's easy to grow! I might have to grab some.""
[Message 50] Jamie: ""Relaxation is always a good thing.""
[Message 51] River: ""Definitely grab some, Alex! You can even dry it and use it in sachets.""

[Message 54] Jamie: ""Okay, I'm officially jealous of your gardening plans. I might have to start small with a few herbs.""

[Message 56] Sam: ""Mint tea is the best.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Mint can definitely be a bit aggressive. I'd recommend planting it in a container.""
[Message 58] Jamie: ""Good tip! I'll keep that in mind.""
[Message 59] River: ""Yeah, definitely container it. Learned that the hard way!""

[Message 73] River: ""Yeah, I think it would be a nice creative outlet.""

[Message 78] Jamie: ""So, Sam, anything exciting happening in the world of sports?""
[Message 79] Sam: ""Well, besides tonight's game, there's been a lot of talk about the upcoming draft.""
[Message 80] River: ""Draft? Is that for baseball?""
[Message 81] Sam: ""It's for football. NFL draft is coming up soon.""
[Message 82] Jamie: ""Ah, okay. I'm not super familiar with football.""
[Message 83] River: ""Me neither. I know the basics, but that's about it.""
[Message 84] Sam: ""It's a big deal for a lot of teams. Hoping my team gets some good picks.""

[Message 101] River: ""No theme, just a casual get-together. Still trying to find the perfect outfit.""
[Message 102] Sam: ""The eternal struggle.""
[Message 103] Jamie: ""I know the feeling. I usually just end up wearing jeans and a t-shirt.""
[Message 104] River: ""Haha, comfort is key! But I want to look at least a little bit put-together.""
[Message 105] Sam: ""A little effort goes a long way.""
[Message 106] Jamie: ""True. Maybe a nice top with some accessories?""
[Message 107] River: ""That's a good idea, Jamie! I'll see what I can find in my closet.""
[Message 108] Sam: ""Accessories can definitely elevate an outfit.""
[Message 109] Jamie: ""Okay, I'm going to get started on these cookies. Talk to you both later!""

[Message 115] River: ""Definitely! I'm ready for some sunshine.""
[Message 116] Sam: ""Me too. And maybe getting out to play some basketball soon.""
[Message 117] River: ""Basketball, nice! I'm terrible at sports, but I admire people who are good at them.""
[Message 118] Sam: ""It's all about having fun. I'm not exactly a pro myself.""
[Message 119] River: ""That's the spirit!""
[Message 120] Sam: ""Well, I should probably get back to work. It was nice chatting with you, River.""
[Message 121] River: ""You too, Sam! Have a good day.""

[Message 134] Jamie: ""Haha, I'll try to make them extra delicious then.""
[Message 135] Sam: ""The pressure is on!""
[Message 136] River: ""No pressure! Just bake with love.""
[Message 137] Jamie: ""Baking with love... I like that. I'll keep that in mind.""

[Message 2] Jamie: Totally! I'm still buzzing! My arms feel like jelly though.
[Message 3] River: Jelly arms are a badge of honor, Jamie.
[Message 4] Sam: Agreed! So, anyone thinking about dinner after this?
[Message 5] Quinn: Dinner sounds good. I’m starving!
[Message 6] Alex: Me too. I burned so many calories trying to beat Jamie's lap time!
[Message 7] Jamie: Sorry, Alex! Gotta be quicker next time! ;)
[Message 8] River: Quicker like a trip to the Bahamas? Anyone planning a vacation soon?
[Message 9] Sam: Ooh, Bahamas! I wish. I'm stuck with paperwork for the next month.
[Message 10] Quinn: Paperwork, ugh. My least favorite thing.
[Message 11] Alex: Tell me about it. I'm dreading my logbook for this week.
[Message 12] Jamie: Logbook? What do you do, Alex?
[Message 13] Alex: Truck driver. Gotta keep track of everything.
[Message 14] River: Wow, that’s cool, Alex! Have you been all over the country?
[Message 15] Alex: Pretty much! Seen a lot of interesting places.
[Message 16] Sam: Any recommendations for road trip destinations? I need a break.
[Message 17] Quinn: Road trips are the best!
[Message 18] Alex: Depends what you're into. The Pacific Coast Highway is beautiful, but crowded.
[Message 19] Jamie: PCH is stunning! Done that a few times.
[Message 20] River: I've always wanted to see the Redwood forests.
[Message 21] Sam: Redwoods sound amazing! How far are those from here?
[Message 22] Quinn: A good drive, Sam. Northern California, really.
[Message 23] Alex: Yeah, a good 8-10 hours, depending on traffic.
[Message 24] Jamie: Speaking of driving, my car needs an oil change… completely off topic, sorry!
[Message 25] River: Happens to the best of us, Jamie!
[Message 26] Sam: Back to travel - anyone been to Europe recently?
[Message 27] Quinn: I went to Italy last year. It was incredible!
[Message 28] Alex: Italy is definitely on my list. All that history!
[Message 29] Jamie: I’m more of a beach person, myself.
[Message 30] River: Beaches are great, but I love exploring old castles and museums.
[Message 31] Sam: Castles sound fun! Which part of Italy did you visit, Quinn?
[Message 32] Quinn: Rome, Florence, and Venice. Classic tourist route, but worth it.
[Message 33] Alex: Venice is supposed to be amazing.
[Message 34] Jamie: All those canals!
[Message 35] River: I’d love to see the art in Florence.
[Message 36] Sam: I need a vacation. I think my brain is melting from spreadsheets.
[Message 37] Quinn: I hear you!
[Message 38] Alex: We all need a break sometimes.
[Message 39] Jamie: Any good deals on flights anyone has spotted?
[Message 40] River: I saw something about Iceland on TravelZoo the other day.
[Message 41] Sam: Iceland?! Whoa.
[Message 42] Quinn: Iceland is on my bucket list!
[Message 43] Alex: That's a bit too cold for me. Give me sunshine any day.
[Message 44] Jamie: Me too!
[Message 45] River: The Northern Lights though! That’s a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
[Message 46] Sam: Okay, you're selling me on Iceland.
[Message 47] Quinn: Definitely worth considering.
[Message 48] Alex: I’m sticking with warmer climates. Maybe Mexico.
[Message 49] Jamie: Good choice, Alex!
[Message 50] River: Mexico is always a good option.
[Message 51] Sam: Okay, everyone's making me want to book a flight right now!
[Message 52] Quinn: Haha, join the club!
[Message 53] Alex: Careful, you might get addicted to travel!
[Message 54] Jamie: Is that a bad thing?
[Message 55] River: Only for your wallet!
[Message 56] Sam: True, true.
[Message 57] Quinn: So, back to dinner plans?
[Message 58] Alex: Good call. I'm up for anything, really.

[Message 61] Sam: Thai sounds delicious!
[Message 62] Quinn: I'm in!
[Message 63] Alex: Thai it is!
[Message 64] Jamie: Perfect!
[Message 65] River: Alright, Thai place it is.
[Message 66] Sam: Should we head over now?
[Message 67] Quinn: Sounds good to me.

[Message 121] Sam: Massaman curry!
[Message 122] Quinn: Spring rolls!
[Message 123] Alex: I'll try the red curry.

538,"[Message 1] CHLOE: Did you guys hear about what happened at the Rest Area?
[Message 2] SAM: Yeah, crazy. Poor Sarah.
[Message 3] PRIYA: I can't believe it. Sarah? Dead? What happened?
[Message 4] CHLOE: Apparently, she was poisoned. At Dawn.
[Message 5] SAM: Poisoned? Wow. That’s…intense.
[Message 6] PRIYA: Poisoned! Who would do that?
[Message 7] NOAH: Sickos, that's who. Anyway, anyone seen my Buffalo Bills hat?
[Message 8] SAM: No, Noah. Focus. Sarah is gone.
[Message 9] NOAH: I am focused, Sam. Just need my hat for the game. Bad time for this.
[Message 10] PRIYA: Noah! Have some respect!
[Message 11] NOAH: Fine, fine. Did anyone see anything weird this morning?
[Message 12] CHLOE: I saw Jess near the Rest Area around Dawn.
[Message 13] SAM: Jess? Really? What was she doing?
[Message 14] JESS: Hey! I was just getting coffee. I always go there!
[Message 15] PRIYA: Seriously, Jess? Now is not the time for excuses.
[Message 16] JESS: It's not an excuse! It's the truth! I get my coffee there every morning before my shift.
[Message 17] CHLOE: Okay, okay, calm down everyone. Maybe she really was just getting coffee.
[Message 18] SAM: Still, strange coincidence. Did you see Sarah, Jess?
[Message 19] JESS: No, I didn’t see Sarah. I saw Mark. He looked upset.
[Message 20] NOAH: Mark? Why would he be upset? He was always complaining about her.
[Message 21] PRIYA: Maybe he finally did something about it. He always hated Sarah.
[Message 22] MARK: Whoa, hold on. What are you guys implying?
[Message 23] CHLOE: Nothing, Mark. Just…coincidences.
[Message 24] MARK: I was just at the Rest Area to…uh…clear my head.
[Message 25] SAM: At Dawn? Same time as the murder?
[Message 26] MARK: Yeah, well, I’m an early riser! Is that a crime now?
[Message 27] JESS: He always said he wished she would just disappear.
[Message 28] PRIYA: Seriously, Jess? That’s a pretty serious accusation.
[Message 29] JESS: It’s true! He said it all the time. After she fired him for stealing.
[Message 30] MARK: That’s a lie! She never fired me!
[Message 31] CHLOE: Did she fire you, Mark?
[Message 32] MARK: No! I quit! It was a toxic work environment.
[Message 33] SAM: But you were mad about it, right?
[Message 34] MARK: Maybe a little. But I wouldn't hurt anyone.
[Message 35] NOAH: Guys, this is getting nowhere. The cops will figure it out.
[Message 36] PRIYA: I hope so. Sarah didn’t deserve this.
[Message 37] CHLOE: She didn't. She always looked out for me at work.
[Message 38] SAM: Me too. She was a good person.
[Message 39] JESS: Did anyone hear about what kind of poison it was?
[Message 40] PRIYA: No, why? You planning something, Jess?
[Message 41] JESS: No! Just curious. The news didn’t say.
[Message 42] MARK: You were buying rat Poisoning via ingestion yesterday, Jess! I saw you at the store.
[Message 43] JESS: That’s for my apartment! I have a rat problem!
[Message 44] CHLOE: Okay, guys, let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 45] SAM: Still, the rat Poisoning via ingestion and the coffee trips…it's suspicious.
[Message 46] NOAH: Leave her alone! Maybe she just needs to get rid of rodents!
[Message 47] PRIYA: Noah, always defending everyone.
[Message 48] NOAH: Someone has to! Before we all go jumping to conclusions!
[Message 49] CHLOE: He has a point.
[Message 50] SAM: So, Mark, what time did you leave the Rest Area?
[Message 51] MARK: Around 6 AM. Why?
[Message 52] PRIYA: Did you see anyone else there?
[Message 53] MARK: No. It was pretty deserted.
[Message 54] JESS: Except for me getting coffee.
[Message 55] MARK: Oh, right. You were there. Barely saw you.
[Message 56] CHLOE: This is exhausting. Let’s just let the police handle it.
[Message 57] SAM: I don't know, Chloe. Something feels off.
[Message 58] NOAH: Maybe you're just being paranoid, Sam.
[Message 59] PRIYA: Sam's a pretty good judge of character, Noah.
[Message 60] JESS: Did anyone know if Sarah had any enemies?
[Message 61] MARK: Besides me? Kidding!
[Message 62] CHLOE: I think she might have been clashing with someone about new security protocols.
[Message 63] SAM: Who? Do you know who?
[Message 64] CHLOE: Just heard her mention it in passing. Didn't catch the name.
[Message 65] NOAH: Guys, can we talk about something else? This is giving me a headache.
[Message 66] PRIYA: Sorry, Noah. It’s just hard to think about anything else.
[Message 67] JESS: I know. I keep thinking about her family.
[Message 68] MARK: Yeah, it’s a tragedy.
[Message 69] CHLOE: I heard they're offering a reward for information.
[Message 70] SAM: A reward? That’s…interesting.
[Message 71] NOAH: Well, maybe someone will come forward with something useful.
[Message 72] PRIYA: I hope so.
[Message 73] JESS: Guys, I’m going to go. This is too much for me right now.
[Message 74] MARK: Me too. Need some air.
[Message 75] CHLOE: Okay. Be safe.
[Message 76] SAM: Watch out for each other.
[Message 77] NOAH: Later. I'm going to the game.
[Message 78] PRIYA: This whole thing is making me sick.
[Message 79] CHLOE: Yeah, me too.
[Message 80] SAM: Just be careful, everyone.
[Message 81] CHLOE: Always.
[Message 82] PRIYA: So, anyone actually know anything? Like, really know?
[Message 83] SAM: What do you mean, Priya?
[Message 84] PRIYA: I mean, does anyone have any secrets they're not telling us?
[Message 85] CHLOE: Priya, seriously?
[Message 86] PRIYA: I’m just asking. Sarah was a friend and she deserves justice.
[Message 87] SAM: I agree, but that doesn't mean we accuse each other.
[Message 88] CHLOE: Maybe Mark had a legit reason to be mad.
[Message 89] SAM: Or maybe Jess knew Sarah was going to be there at Dawn.
[Message 90] PRIYA: Maybe Noah knows something he’s not letting on. He hates the police.
[Message 91] CHLOE: Ok, Priya, you're crossing a line.
[Message 92] SAM: Yeah, dial it back.
[Message 93] PRIYA: Sorry, sorry. Just…frustrated.
[Message 94] CHLOE: Me too.
[Message 95] SAM: Me too.
[Message 96] PRIYA: Did anyone see Mark talking to Jess last week? I swear I did.
[Message 97] CHLOE: Now, that's interesting. Mark hates Jess, he makes it known.
[Message 98] SAM: Talking about what?
[Message 99] PRIYA: I couldn’t hear. It looked intense though. Like they were planning something.
[Message 100] CHLOE: Maybe they were planning a surprise party for Sarah.
[Message 101] SAM: Don't be absurd.
[Message 102] PRIYA: Whatever. Just saying what I saw.
[Message 103] CHLOE: I'm going to try and get some sleep. This is draining.
[Message 104] SAM: Me too. Night.
[Message 105] PRIYA: Night.

[Message 106] JESS: (To Mark, private) Did you tell them about us talking?
[Message 107] MARK: (To Jess, private) No! Why would I? I stuck to the story. Did YOU?
[Message 108] JESS: (To Mark, private) Of course not! But Priya said she saw us!
[Message 109] MARK: (To Jess, private) She's lying. Or mistaken. Relax.
[Message 110] JESS: (To Mark, private) Easy for you to say. They're looking at me because of the rat Poisoning via ingestion.
[Message 111] MARK: (To Jess, private) Just stick to the story about the rodents. It'll be fine. Remember what we talked about, they'll get the death penalty for this.
[Message 112] JESS: (To Mark, private) If they find out it was us! What if they do?
[Message 113] MARK: (To Jess, private) They won't. We were careful. And you did get rid of her, right? She couldn't call 911 after?
[Message 114] JESS: (To Mark, private) Yes! Of course! But...are you sure about this?
[Message 115] MARK: (To Jess, private) Positive. Sarah intended to ruin me. I’m just evening the score.

[Message 116] NOAH: (To Priya, private) You really think I know something?
[Message 117] PRIYA: (To Noah, private) I don't know, Noah. You're always so quick to defend people.
[Message 118] NOAH: (To Priya, private) Someone has to. The cops will find someone to blame to justify firing her. It's just my nature.
[Message 119] PRIYA: (To Noah, private) Just be honest with me. Did you see anything? Hear anything?
[Message 120] NOAH: (To Priya, private) I saw Jess buying Poisoning via ingestion. But she said it was for rats.
[Message 121] PRIYA: (To Noah, private) You believe her?
[Message 122] NOAH: (To Priya, private) I don't know what to believe anymore.
[Message 123] PRIYA: (To Noah, private) Just be careful, Noah.
[Message 124] NOAH: (To Priya, private) You too, Priya.

[Message 125] SAM: (To Chloe, private) I can't shake the feeling that Mark and Jess are in this together.
[Message 126] CHLOE: (To Sam, private) I know. It's weird, right?
[Message 127] SAM: (To Chloe, private) Did Sarah ever mention anything about Mark blackmailing her?
[Message 128] CHLOE: (To Sam, private) No, why?
[Message 129] SAM: (To Chloe, private) Just a hunch. He's always seemed like he had something to hide.
[Message 130] CHLOE: (To Sam, private) Maybe. But Jess is shady too.
[Message 131] SAM: (To Chloe, private) They both are. We need to be careful.
[Message 132] CHLOE: (To Sam, private) Agreed. This is getting dangerous.

[Message 133] CHLOE: (Group Chat) Hey, did anyone hear back from the police?
[Message 134] SAM: (Group Chat) Not yet.
[Message 135] PRIYA: (Group Chat) Nothing here either.
[Message 136] NOAH: (Group Chat) Cops are useless anyway.
[Message 137] JESS: (Group Chat) Still thinking of Sarah.
[Message 138] MARK: (Group Chat) Me too. A real tragedy.
[Message 139] CHLOE: (Group Chat) We should all try to remember the good times with her.
[Message 140] SAM: (Group Chat) That's a good idea, Chloe.",1,

[Message 4] Sarah: ""Morning all! Haven't been to the cinema in ages. Busy with parent-teacher meetings, ugh.""
[Message 5] David: ""Sarah, I feel you. My grandkids' school keeps me running!""
[Message 6] Alex: ""Absolutely worth the hype, Jordan. It's chaotic but brilliant. Get ready to think!""
[Message 7] Jordan: ""Okay, you've convinced me. Adding it to my list.""
[Message 8] Sarah: ""What kind of movies are we talking? Action, comedy, drama?""
[Message 9] David: ""Anything good! I'm open to suggestions. Though I prefer something with a decent plot these days.""
[Message 10] Alex: ""'Everything Everywhere' is a bit of everything, Sarah. Action, comedy, drama, sci-fi... a real genre-bender.""
[Message 11] Jordan: ""Sci-fi sounds good. Been a while since I watched a good sci-fi movie.""
[Message 12] Sarah: ""Sci-fi is usually a miss for me. Too many explosions and not enough story!""
[Message 13] David: ""I agree, Sarah. Give me a good historical drama any day.""
[Message 14] Alex: ""Alright, alright. For something less intense, how about 'The Banshees of Inisherin'? Darkly funny.""
[Message 15] Jordan: ""Oh, I saw that! Loved the Irish landscape. And the acting was superb.""
[Message 16] Sarah: ""Banshees... wasn't that supposed to be really depressing?""
[Message 17] David: ""A bit, yes. But very well done. Colin Farrell was fantastic.""
[Message 18] Alex: ""Yeah, it's not exactly a feel-good movie, Sarah. But it's definitely thought-provoking.""
[Message 19] Jordan: ""What about something lighter? Anyone seen any good comedies recently?""
[Message 20] Sarah: ""I need a good laugh after all these parent-teacher conferences. Send help (and comedy recommendations)!""
[Message 21] David: ""I heard 'Ticket to Paradise' was decent. George Clooney and Julia Roberts.""
[Message 22] Alex: ""Ticket to Paradise was pretty good, definitely a lighthearted rom-com.""
[Message 23] Jordan: ""Rom-coms are usually a safe bet. Easy to watch.""
[Message 24] Sarah: ""Okay, 'Ticket to Paradise' it is. Thanks, David!""
[Message 25] David: ""No problem, Sarah! Hope you enjoy it.""

[Message 32] Sarah: ""Ooh, I love a good documentary. Anything in particular you're interested in, Jordan?""
[Message 33] David: ""I recently watched one about the history of hiking trails. Quite interesting.""
[Message 34] Alex: ""My interest is in finance. Have you seen on Netflix 'Dirty Money'?""
[Message 35] Jordan: ""I've seen 'Dirty Money,' Alex. Eye-opening, to say the least.""

[Message 40] Sarah: ""Tell me about it! Mine thinks she's a teenager already.""
[Message 41] David: ""Grandkids are the same! Always wanting the latest gadgets.""
[Message 42] Alex: ""Kids these days, huh? Back to movies! Anyone excited for the new Indiana Jones?""
[Message 43] Jordan: ""Indy! Classic. Hope it's good.""
[Message 44] Sarah: ""Harrison Ford's still doing action movies? Wow.""
[Message 45] David: ""He's a legend, Sarah! Hope it's a good one too.""
[Message 46] Alex: ""Yeah, let's hope it lives up to the hype. What about Oppenheimer?""
[Message 47] Jordan: ""Oppenheimer looks intense. Nolan's movies are always a trip.""
[Message 48] Sarah: ""That's the one about the atomic bomb, right? Seems a bit heavy.""
[Message 49] David: ""Very heavy subject matter, but I'm sure Nolan will handle it well.""
[Message 50] Alex: ""Definitely not a lighthearted choice! So many good movies coming out this summer.""
[Message 51] Jordan: ""It is a bit overwhelming, isn't it?""
[Message 52] Sarah: ""Seriously! I need a spreadsheet just to keep track.""
[Message 53] David: ""I just rely on recommendations from you young folks.""
[Message 54] Alex: ""Haha, we'll keep you updated, David. Any particular genres you're avoiding?""
[Message 55] Jordan: ""Horror for me. Can't handle it.""
[Message 56] Sarah: ""Same here. Nightmares for days!""
[Message 57] David: ""Too much blood and gore for my taste.""
[Message 58] Alex: ""Fair enough! No horror recommendations then. Anyone else seen 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'?""
[Message 59] Jordan: ""Not yet! But I'm planning to.""
[Message 60] Sarah: ""My daughter loved it. Said it was surprisingly emotional.""
[Message 61] David: ""Might give that one a try. My grandson's a big Marvel fan.""
[Message 62] Alex: ""It's a good one! Definitely worth seeing. Okay, I gotta run. Catch you all later!""
[Message 63] Jordan: ""Bye Alex!""
[Message 64] Sarah: ""See ya, Alex!""
[Message 65] David: ""Goodbye, Alex!""
[Message 66] Jordan: ""So, Sarah, how are the parent-teacher meetings going?""
[Message 67] Sarah: ""Ugh, don't even ask. The usual complaints about screen time and homework.""
[Message 68] Jordan: ""Sounds familiar. It's a constant battle.""
[Message 69] David: ""It was the same when my kids were younger, just different distractions.""
[Message 70] Sarah: ""True. It's just a never-ending cycle.""
[Message 71] Jordan: ""Maybe we should start a support group.""
[Message 72] Sarah: ""I'd be there every week!""
[Message 73] David: ""I'd offer my wisdom from the sidelines.""
[Message 74] Jordan: ""Anyone seen a movie called 'Past Lives'?""
[Message 75] Sarah: ""I saw the trailer! Looks really good. Melancholy but beautiful.""
[Message 76] David: ""Haven't heard of it, but I'll look it up.""
[Message 77] Jordan: ""It's supposed to be really moving. Thinking of seeing it this weekend.""
[Message 78] Sarah: ""Let me know what you think!""

[Message 86] David: ""That sounds nice, Jordan. What are you planting?""
[Message 87] Jordan: ""Trying my hand at tomatoes this year. Wish me luck!""
[Message 88] Sarah: ""Good luck! They can be tricky.""
[Message 89] David: ""Just make sure they get plenty of sun.""
[Message 90] Jordan: ""Thanks for the tips! Okay, I should probably get started.""

[Message 93] Jordan: ""You too, David!""
[Message 94] Sarah: ""Thanks, David! Talk soon.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""Sorry, one more thing! Anyone have good podcast recommendations?""
[Message 96] David: ""I listen to a history podcast sometimes. 'Hardcore History' I think it's called.""
[Message 97] Jordan: ""Hardcore History is intense! I prefer something a bit lighter. I like 'Stuff You Should Know.'""
[Message 98] Sarah: ""I'm a big fan of true crime podcasts... but maybe we shouldn't go there?""
[Message 99] David: ""Probably best to avoid those, Sarah.""
[Message 100] Alex: ""Yeah, maybe something a little less... dark. 'Stuff You Should Know' sounds interesting, Jordan.""
[Message 101] Jordan: ""It's really informative and entertaining! They cover all sorts of topics.""
[Message 102] Sarah: ""I'll check it out. Thanks, Jordan!""
[Message 103] David: ""I might give that one a listen as well.""
[Message 104] Alex: ""Awesome! Thanks, everyone. Seriously gotta go now!""
[Message 105] Jordan: ""Bye again, Alex!""
[Message 106] Sarah: ""Bye!""
[Message 107] David: ""Goodbye!""
[Message 108] Jordan: ""Okay, back to gardening. Anyone have any tips for dealing with aphids?""
[Message 109] Sarah: ""Neem oil! Works like a charm.""
[Message 110] David: ""I've heard good things about ladybugs.""
[Message 111] Jordan: ""Ladybugs! Good idea! I'll have to look into that.""
[Message 112] Sarah: ""They're natural predators, so they're a good organic option.""
[Message 113] David: ""Exactly. Avoid using harsh chemicals if you can.""
[Message 114] Jordan: ""Definitely trying to keep it organic. Thanks for the advice, both of you!""
[Message 115] Sarah: ""No problem! Happy gardening.""
[Message 116] David: ""Enjoy the sunshine, Jordan!""
[Message 117] Jordan: ""Will do! You too, David.""
[Message 118] Sarah: ""Okay, gotta run! Good luck with the tomatoes, Jordan!""
[Message 119] Jordan: ""Thanks, Sarah! See ya!""
[Message 120] David: ""Goodbye, Sarah!""
[Message 121] David: ""Just finished my hike. Beautiful day in Rock Creek Park.""
[Message 122] Jordan: ""Glad you enjoyed it, David!""
[Message 123] David: ""Now, to relax and maybe watch a movie.""
[Message 124] Jordan: ""Treat yourself! You deserve it.""
[Message 125] David: ""What movie should I watch?""
[Message 126] Jordan: ""'Past Lives' is my suggestion, of course!""
[Message 127] David: ""I'll check out the trailer. Thanks, Jordan.""
[Message 128] Jordan: ""Let me know what you think!""
[Message 129] David: ""Will do. Have a good evening, Jordan.""
[Message 130] Jordan: ""You too, David!""
[Message 131] Alex: ""Alright, one last movie recommendation! 'The Menu' - anyone seen it?""
[Message 132] David: ""Heard of it! Isn't it a thriller?""
[Message 133] Jordan: ""I think so. Darkly comedic thriller, maybe?""
[Message 134] Sarah: ""My husband watched it and said it was weird but good.""
[Message 135] David: ""Weird but good... intriguing.""
[Message 136] Alex: ""Yeah, it's definitely unique. Very well-acted, though.""
[Message 137] Jordan: ""Okay, adding that to the list too. My watchlist is getting long!""
[Message 138] Sarah: ""Mine too! So many movies, so little time.""
[Message 139] David: ""That's the truth! Well, I'm off to watch a trailer. Talk to you all later!""
[Message 140] Alex: ""Later, David!""
[Message 141] Jordan: ""Bye, David!""
[Message 142] Sarah: ""Have a good evening, David!""
[Message 143] Alex: ""Seriously, I'm out now! Enjoy the movies!""
[Message 144] Jordan: ""Bye Alex! Have fun at the game!""
[Message 145] Sarah: ""Bye!""
[Message 146] Jordan: ""Well, that was a lot of movie talk!""
[Message 147] Sarah: ""Definitely! Now I have a ton of movies to watch.""
[Message 148] Jordan: ""Me too! Maybe we should start a movie club.""
[Message 149] Sarah: ""That's a great idea! We could watch a movie a week and then discuss it.""
[Message 150] Jordan: ""I'm in! We could alternate who picks the movie.""
[Message 151] Sarah: ""Sounds perfect! I'm excited!""
[Message 152] Jordan: ""Me too! We should get David in on it as well.""
[Message 153] Sarah: ""Definitely! He'd love it.""
[Message 154] Jordan: ""Okay, let's plan this out later this week.""
[Message 155] Sarah: ""Sounds good! I'm free on Wednesday evening.""
[Message 156] Jordan: ""Wednesday works for me too!""
[Message 157] Sarah: ""Great! Let's chat more then. I have to get back to work now.""
[Message 158] Jordan: ""Okay! Talk to you later, Sarah!""
[Message 159] Sarah: ""Bye!""
[Message 160] Jordan: ""Now, back to those tomatoes...""
[Message 161] David: ""Just watched the trailer for 'Past Lives'. Looks very interesting, Jordan. Thanks for the recommendation!""
[Message 162] Jordan: ""You're welcome, David! Glad you liked it. Thinking about seeing it this weekend.""
[Message 163] David: ""Might join you. Let me know when you're planning to go.""
[Message 164] Jordan: ""Will do! I'll keep you posted.""
[Message 165] David: ""Great! Well, enjoy your evening, Jordan.""
[Message 166] Jordan: ""You too, David!""
[Message 167] David: ""Thinking about what snacks to have while watching...""
[Message 168] Jordan: ""Popcorn is always a classic!""
[Message 169] David: ""True! Or maybe some ice cream.""
[Message 170] Jordan: ""Ice cream sounds good too! Depends on the mood.""
[Message 171] David: ""Exactly! A little bit of both, maybe?""
[Message 172] Jordan: ""Living the dream, David!""
[Message 173] David: ""Haha! Just trying to enjoy myself. Alright, I'm off to find some snacks. Talk to you later, Jordan!""
[Message 174] Jordan: ""Enjoy your movie, David!""
[Message 175] Sarah: ""Hey, just saw that David watched the 'Past Lives' trailer! Great pick, Jordan!""
[Message 176] Jordan: ""Thanks! Hopefully, he'll enjoy the movie too.""
[Message 177] Sarah: ""I'm sure he will. He appreciates a good story.""
[Message 178] Jordan: ""Well, I'm off to tend to my garden. Hoping those aphids are gone!""
[Message 179] Sarah: ""Good luck! Let me know if the neem oil works!""
[Message 180] Jordan: ""Will do! Talk to you later, Sarah!""
[Message 181] Sarah: ""Bye!""
[Message 182] David: ""Popcorn and ice cream acquired! Ready for a movie night.""
[Message 183] Jordan: ""Enjoy, David!""
[Message 184] David: ""Thanks, Jordan! Catch you later.""
[Message 185] Sarah: ""Hope you enjoy the movie, David! And that ice cream!""
[Message 186] David: ""Thanks, Sarah! I will!""
[Message 187] Jordan: ""Well, I think that's all the movie talk from me for today! Time for some real life!""

[Message 2] Maya: Yeah, it's all over the news. So messed up. Two people?
[Message 3] Noah: Who were they? I only saw something about a ""tragic incident.""
[Message 4] Liam: I heard it was... I think their names were Alex and Sarah.
[Message 5] Maya: Alex?! The 10. Social Worker? I used to see them at the coffee shop.
[Message 6] Noah: Sarah? Wasn't she that Corrections Officer? Seemed so carefree.
[Message 7] Liam: Yeah, that's what I heard. So crazy. What even happened?
[Message 8] Maya: They're saying Poisoning via inhalation. In a parking garage. Makes no sense.
[Message 9] Noah: Poisoning via inhalation? That's awful. Someone must have really hated them.
[Message 10] Liam: Police are looking for suspects, apparently. Said it wasn't random.
[Message 11] Maya: Well, duh. Who just randomly Poisoning via inhalations two people?
[Message 12] Noah: This whole thing is just... depressing. I can't even imagine.
[Message 13] Liam: Seriously. Makes you wonder about people.
[Message 14] Maya: I need a distraction. Anyone wanna grab dinner later?
[Message 15] Noah: I'm in. Anywhere but downtown, though.
[Message 16] Liam: Count me in. Pizza?
[Message 17] Maya: Pizza sounds perfect.
[Message 18] Liam: Okay, I'll book a table. See you guys at 7?
[Message 19] Maya: Sounds good!
[Message 20] Noah: Perfect. Later!
[Message 21] Liam: Later.
[Message 22] Asher: Hey guys, you seen Marco around? Need to ask him something.
[Message 23] Liam: Haven't seen him today, Asher. Why?
[Message 24] Asher: Just a work thing. Nothing important.
[Message 25] Maya: Asher, you seem on edge. Everything okay?
[Message 26] Asher: Yeah, fine. Just stressed about this project deadline.
[Message 27] Noah: Deadlines, huh? I know that feeling.
[Message 28] Asher: Anyway, gotta run. Let me know if you see Marco.
[Message 29] Liam: Will do.
[Message 30] Maya: Later, Asher.
[Message 31] Noah: See ya.
[Message 32] Marco: Hey, what's up? Just saw I missed a call from Asher.
[Message 33] Maya: He was looking for you. Seemed kind of stressed.
[Message 34] Marco: Stressed? About what?
[Message 35] Maya: He didn't say. Just said it was a work thing.
[Message 36] Liam: Maybe it's about the layoffs they're planning?
[Message 37] Marco: Layoffs? Seriously? I hadn't heard anything.
[Message 38] Noah: That's just a rumor, Liam. Don't scare him.
[Message 39] Maya: Yeah, Liam, chill. Don't spread gossip.
[Message 40] Liam: Sorry, sorry. Just saying what I heard.
[Message 41] Marco: Well, great. Now I'm stressed too.
[Message 42] Marco: Hey, did you guys hear about what happened to Alex and Sarah?
[Message 43] Liam: Dude, that's all we've been talking about.
[Message 44] Marco: Crazy, right? I saw Sarah just the other day.
[Message 45] Noah: I saw him leave the building at Afternoon.
[Message 46] Marco: I can't believe it, I heard she was buying Poisoning via inhalation at the store.
[Message 47] Maya: Yeah, that whole thing is so sad and I feel bad for them.
[Message 48] Liam: I think Asher may know more.
[Message 49] Marco: Asher? What makes you say that?
[Message 50] Liam: I don't know, he just seemed weird when he was asking about you.
[Message 51] Maya: Liam, you're being paranoid.
[Message 52] Noah: Yeah, let's not start pointing fingers.
[Message 53] Liam: Fine, fine. Just a feeling.
[Message 54] Marco: Anyway, I gotta go. Catch you guys later.
[Message 55] Maya: Later, Marco.
[Message 56] Noah: See ya.
[Message 57] Liam: Later.
[Message 58] Asher: Marco, can you meet me at my office? Something important to discuss.
[Message 59] Marco: Now? I was just about to head home.
[Message 60] Asher: It's about the parking garage thing.
[Message 61] Marco: Parking garage? What about it?
[Message 62] Asher: I can't say over text. Just come.
[Message 63] Marco: Fine, but this better be good.
[Message 64] Marco: Okay, I'm here. What's this about?
[Message 65] Asher: Look, the cops are asking questions. They know I saw you near the garage at Afternoon.
[Message 66] Marco: So what? I was just passing by.
[Message 67] Asher: They also know you hated Sarah, and that he was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.
[Message 68] Marco: Where did they get that idea from? I don't know what you're talking about.
[Message 69] Asher: Don't play dumb with me, Marco. I know you and Sarah were fighting recently.
[Message 70] Marco: That's none of your business.
[Message 71] Asher: It is now. If they think we were in this together, we're both going down.
[Message 72] Marco: Together? You're crazy!
[Message 73] Asher: Then tell me what you were doing there!
[Message 74] Marco: I already told you, I was just passing by.
[Message 75] Asher: Don't lie to me.
[Message 76] Marco: Look, I had a reason to be there, okay? But it has nothing to do with what happened to Alex and Sarah.
[Message 77] Asher: What reason?
[Message 78] Marco: I can't tell you. You won't understand.
[Message 79] Asher: I'm starting to think you're the one who did it.
[Message 80] Marco: What?! No way!
[Message 81] Asher: Then tell me the truth!
[Message 82] Marco: I'm not saying anything else without a lawyer.
[Message 83] Asher: Fine. But don't come crying to me when they arrest you.
[Message 84] Marco: You think I'm going to get the death penalty?
[Message 85] Asher: Depends on what they find. And what you tell them.
[Message 86] Marco: I didn't do anything!
[Message 87] Asher: We'll see about that.
[Message 88] Maya: Liam, you were right. Asher IS acting weird.
[Message 89] Liam: Told you! What did he say?
[Message 90] Maya: He just called me, asking if I'd seen Marco. Sounded almost desperate.
[Message 91] Noah: Maybe they're both involved somehow?
[Message 92] Liam: That's what I'm thinking.
[Message 93] Maya: Should we go to the police?
[Message 94] Noah: Let's not jump to conclusions. We don't have any proof.
[Message 95] Liam: But what if they're planning something else?
[Message 96] Maya: Okay, okay. Let's just keep an eye on them for now.
[Message 97] Noah: Agreed. We'll observe and see what happens.
[Message 98] Liam: Good plan. Text me if either of them does anything suspicious.
[Message 99] Maya: Will do. This is so messed up.
[Message 100] Noah: Tell me about it.
[Message 101] Liam: Hey guys, I saw Asher getting into a car with someone I didn’t recognize.
[Message 102] Maya: Where? When?
[Message 103] Liam: Just now, outside his office. They drove off really fast.
[Message 104] Noah: Did you get a license plate?
[Message 105] Liam: No, it was too dark. But it was a black SUV.
[Message 106] Maya: Black SUV... That could be anyone.
[Message 107] Liam: I know, but still. It seemed suspicious.
[Message 108] Noah: Maybe he's just leaving town.
[Message 109] Maya: Or trying to.
[Message 110] Liam: I think he intended to leave.
[Message 111] Liam: Guys, I just saw Marco at the gas station.
[Message 112] Maya: Did he see you?
[Message 113] Liam: No, I ducked down. He was filling up a gas can.
[Message 114] Noah: A gas can? What for?
[Message 115] Liam: I don't know, but it seemed weird. He looked really nervous.
[Message 116] Maya: Maybe he's just going camping.
[Message 117] Liam: In a gas can?
[Message 118] Noah: Okay, that IS weird.
[Message 119] Maya: Let's call the police. This is getting too risky.
[Message 120] Liam: Agreed. I'm calling them now.
[Message 121] Noah: Good call. Be safe.
[Message 122] Maya: Be careful, Liam.
[Message 123] Liam: Theyre on their way.
[Message 124] Noah: Okay, now what?
[Message 125] Liam: We wait. And hope they catch them before they do something else.
[Message 126] Maya: I can't believe this is happening.
[Message 127] Noah: Me neither. It's like something out of a movie.
[Message 128] Liam: More like a nightmare.
[Message 129] Maya: I hope they catch the people who did this. Alex and Sarah deserved better.
[Message 130] Noah: Amen to that.
[Message 131] Marco: Asher, you set me up, didn’t you?
[Message 132] Asher: What are you talking about?
[Message 133] Marco: The police just showed up at my door! They knew everything!
[Message 134] Asher: I didn't tell them anything!
[Message 135] Marco: Then how did they know I was at the parking garage?!
[Message 136] Asher: I don't know! Maybe they were watching you!
[Message 137] Marco: Bullshit! You wanted me to take the fall, didn’t you?
[Message 138] Asher: Don't be ridiculous.
[Message 139] Marco: You're going down for this, Asher! I swear, you're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 140] Asher: I'm innocent!
[Message 141] Marco: We'll see what the police thinks.
[Message 142] Liam: Hey, police found Poisoning via inhalation in Asher's car.

[Message 11] River: Midnight it is! By the way, anyone seen the new mural downtown? Heard it's amazing.
[Message 12] Sam: Not yet, but I've seen pics online. Looks pretty cool!
[Message 13] Kai: I drove past it the other day. It's stunning in person.
[Message 14] River: I need to make a point of checking it out. Okay, back to fitness…any good workout tips lately?
[Message 15] Sam: I've been trying to incorporate more yoga into my routine. It's surprisingly challenging!
[Message 16] Kai: Yoga's great! I'm more of a cardio person myself. Dancing is my go-to.
[Message 17] River: Dancing? That's awesome, Kai! What kind?
[Message 18] Kai: All kinds! Salsa, hip hop, even a little bit of ballet.
[Message 19] River: Wow, impressive! I'm stuck with walking and maybe some light stretching. My old bones complain otherwise.
[Message 20] Sam: Hey, walking is great exercise! And stretching is super important.

[Message 64] Kai: Goodnight!
[Message 65] (Next morning) Kai: River, you alive? At the pool!
[Message 66] River: (Groggily) Be there in 5. Coffee first.
[Message 67] Kai: Haha, understood!
[Message 68] (Later) River: Okay, made it! Freezing!
[Message 69] Kai: Told you it would be invigorating! Jump in!
[Message 70] River: Brave words. You go first!
[Message 71] Kai: Fine, fine. Here goes nothing!
[Message 72] River: (Silence)
[Message 73] Kai: Okay, it's not *that* bad. Come on in!
[Message 74] River: Okay, okay. Here I come!
[Message 75] (After the swim) River: Okay, I admit it. That was actually pretty good.
[Message 76] Kai: Told ya! Feel awake now?
[Message 77] River: Surprisingly, yes. Maybe I'll make this a regular thing.
[Message 78] Kai: Awesome! Let's do it!
[Message 79] River: Next time, though, we need to find a warmer pool.
[Message 80] Kai: Fair enough. We can research some options.
[Message 81] River: Deal. So, what's on the agenda for today?
[Message 82] Kai: I'm teaching today, so busy, busy.
[Message 83] River: Ah, right. What grade do you teach?
[Message 84] Kai: Third grade. They're a handful, but I love them.
[Message 85] River: I can imagine! I used to volunteer in a kindergarten class. It was…energetic.
[Message 86] Kai: Energetic is an understatement!
[Message 87] River: Haha, tell me about it.
[Message 88] Kai: What about you, River? Any big plans?
[Message 89] River: Just some errands and maybe some drawing later. A pretty quiet day.
[Message 90] Kai: Sounds relaxing!
[Message 91] River: It will be. I need a break after that swim!
[Message 92] Kai: True! Okay, gotta run. Class is starting soon.
[Message 93] River: Good luck! Have a great day!
[Message 94] Kai: Thanks! You too!
[Message 95] River: Just saw a hummingbird! They're so tiny and fast.
[Message 96] Kai: Ooh, lucky! I love hummingbirds.
[Message 97] River: They're amazing. I should try drawing one. Challenge accepted!
[Message 98] Kai: You should! I'd love to see it.
[Message 99] River: I'll send you a pic if it turns out halfway decent.
[Message 100] Kai: Awesome!
[Message 101] River: Okay, time to get to work. Later!
[Message 102] Kai: Later!
[Message 103] Sam: (Later that day) Hey guys! How was the swim?
[Message 104] Kai: It was invigorating! River actually made it!
[Message 105] River: Against my better judgment, but yes, I did!
[Message 106] Sam: Haha! Good for you both! How was the water?
[Message 107] Kai: Cold! But we survived.
[Message 108] River: Barely. But we're stronger for it. Or something.
[Message 109] Sam: Glad to hear it! Soup kitchen was a success. Feeling good!
[Message 110] Kai: That's great, Sam! You're a superstar.
[Message 111] River: Totally agree. You're doing important work, Sam.
[Message 112] Sam: Thanks, guys! It means a lot.
[Message 113] Kai: So, what's everyone up to this evening?
[Message 114] River: Thinking about watching a movie. Maybe something classic.
[Message 115] Sam: I might just chill and read a book. Exhausted from today.
[Message 116] Kai: I'm grading papers. The glamorous life of a teacher.
[Message 117] River: Oh, the joys of paperwork.
[Message 118] Sam: I remember those days!
[Message 119] Kai: You were a teacher before, Sam?
[Message 120] Sam: No, I was never a teacher, but I had kids in school! Lots of parent-teacher conferences.
[Message 121] Kai: Ah, gotcha!
[Message 122] River: Makes sense.
[Message 123] Kai: Anyway, I should probably get back to it. Enjoy your movie, River!
[Message 124] River: Will do! And you enjoy your papers. (Said no one ever.)
[Message 125] Kai: Haha! Goodnight, Sam!
[Message 126] Sam: Night! Sleep well!
[Message 127] River: Goodnight!
[Message 128] Sam: Thinking about starting a garden. Any tips?
[Message 129] River: Oh, I love gardening! What kind of garden are you thinking of?
[Message 130] Sam: Maybe just some herbs and vegetables. Nothing too fancy.
[Message 131] River: Start small! Rosemary, basil, and mint are pretty easy to grow.
[Message 132] Kai: That sounds amazing, Sam! Fresh herbs are the best.
[Message 133] Sam: Right? That's what I'm thinking!
[Message 134] River: Definitely! And tomatoes are relatively easy too, if you have a sunny spot.
[Message 135] Sam: I do have a sunny spot! Okay, I'm getting excited now!
[Message 136] Kai: This is great! I need to start gardening too.
[Message 137] River: It's so rewarding to grow your own food.
[Message 138] Sam: I can't wait! Thanks for the tips, River!
[Message 139] River: You're welcome! Happy gardening!
[Message 140] Kai: This conversation made me hungry.
[Message 141] River: Me too! I might have to make a late-night snack.
[Message 142] Sam: Haha! Same!
[Message 143] Kai: What are you thinking of having?
[Message 144] River: Maybe some toast with avocado. Simple but satisfying.
[Message 145] Sam: Ooh, that sounds good! I'm thinking a piece of fruit.
[Message 146] Kai: I might just grab a handful of nuts.
[Message 147] River: Healthy choices all around!
[Message 148] Sam: We're on a roll!
[Message 149] Kai: Let's keep it up!
[Message 150] River: Speaking of healthy… I really need to start flossing more regularly.
[Message 151] Sam: Don’t we all!
[Message 152] Kai: Yep. A constant struggle.
[Message 153] River: Okay, snack time! Talk to you later!
[Message 154] Sam: Enjoy! Bye!
[Message 155] Kai: Bye!
[Message 156] River: Just finished my toast. Delicious!
[Message 157] Kai: Awesome!
[Message 158] Sam: Fruit was good too!
[Message 159] Kai: Glad to hear it! Okay, I'm officially done grading papers for the night.
[Message 160] River: Hallelujah!
[Message 161] Sam: Freedom!
[Message 162] Kai: Exactly! Time to relax.
[Message 163] River: Enjoy it! You deserve it.
[Message 164] Sam: Totally!
[Message 165] Kai: Thanks! You guys have a good night!
[Message 166] River: You too!
[Message 167] Sam: Sweet dreams!
[Message 168] Kai: Sweet dreams!
[Message 169] River: Catch you later!
[Message 170] Sam: Bye!
[Message 171] Kai: Bye!
[Message 172] River: So, anyone know any good podcasts about… drawing?
[Message 173] Sam: Haha, sticking to the theme!
[Message 174] Kai: Love it! No idea about podcasts, though. Sorry!
[Message 175] River: No worries! I'll do some digging. Goodnight for real this time",0,

[Message 2] Chris: ""Yeah, crazy. Two people dead. What's going on?""
[Message 3] David: ""I saw it on the news. Horrible. Anyone know them?""
[Message 4] Sarah: ""I knew Jordan. He was a journalist, pretty stubborn guy. Always digging for dirt.""
[Message 5] Chris: ""Damn. Bad news. I hope they find who did it. Imagine, someone's desire for notoriety leading to that.""
[Message 6] David: ""Me too. This town is getting scarier.""
[Message 7] Sarah: ""I heard they found a Strangulation with a rope. Sick.""
[Message 8] Chris: ""A Strangulation with a rope? That's... intense. Almost makes you think it was personal.""
[Message 9] David: ""I guess. Or just a weapon of opportunity.""
[Message 10] Sarah: ""Maybe. Hey, anyone seen Alex lately? He seemed really stressed last week.""
[Message 11] Chris: ""Alex? Nah. Why?""
[Message 12] Sarah: ""Just asking. He was saying some weird stuff about Jordan, something about him deserving it.""
[Message 13] David: ""Wow, that's not good. Deserving it? That's a strong statement.""
[Message 14] Chris: ""I don't know. Alex is always saying crazy stuff. Doesn't mean he'd actually do anything.""
[Message 15] Sarah: ""True, but still...""
[Message 16] David: ""Speaking of weird, I saw Bailey buying a bunch of rope at the hardware store the other day. Thought it was odd.""
[Message 17] Chris: ""Rope? Maybe she's into macrame or something.""
[Message 18] Sarah: ""Macrame? Now? That's a stretch, Chris. And she purposefully didn't say what it was for.""
[Message 19] David: ""Exactly! She got defensive when I asked.""
[Message 20] Chris: ""Okay, okay, I get it. It's suspicious.""
[Message 21] Sarah: ""Suspicious is an understatement.""
[Message 22] David: ""Well, I gotta go. Keep me updated if you hear anything.""
[Message 23] Chris: ""Will do.""
[Message 24] Sarah: ""Later.""
[Message 25] Chris: ""So, Sarah, you really think Alex is capable of something like this?""
[Message 26] Sarah: ""I don't *know*, Chris. But he hated Jordan. He always hated 4.  Journalist. And he's got that impulsive act of rage thing going on.""
[Message 27] Chris: ""Hate is a strong word. Plus that Alex has a scar above left eyebrow. Easy to identify.""
[Message 28] Sarah: ""True. But Alex also knew the manager at the clinic, Taylor. The law enforcement Officer. He mentioned something about her stubbornness before.""
[Message 29] Chris: ""Okay, that's definitely... something. Maybe we should tell the police?""
[Message 30] Sarah: ""Maybe. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. We need more information.""
[Message 31] Chris: ""Agreed. This is messed up.""
[Message 32] Sarah: ""Did you hear they think it happened late evening?""
[Message 33] Chris: ""Yeah. I was home all night. Watched a movie.""
[Message 34] Sarah: ""Lucky you. I was working late.""
[Message 35] Chris: ""What about Alex and Bailey?""
[Message 36] Sarah: ""I have no idea. I haven't spoken to Alex since Tuesday.""
[Message 37] Chris: ""And Bailey?""
[Message 38] Sarah: ""I saw Bailey yesterday, but we just exchanged pleasantries. Nothing about rope or anything.""
[Message 39] Chris: ""Right. Well, keep your ears open.""
[Message 40] Sarah: ""You too.""
[Message 41] David: ""Hey guys, new info. Apparently, Taylor, the LEO, was investigating some shady stuff at Alex's work.""
[Message 42] Chris: ""Whoa. That adds a whole new layer.""
[Message 43] Sarah: ""Seriously? What kind of shady stuff?""
[Message 44] David: ""I don't know the details, but it was something about embezzlement. If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened.""
[Message 45] Chris: ""So, motive for Alex to get rid of Taylor. Makes sense.""
[Message 46] Sarah: ""And maybe Jordan found out about it and Alex had to silence him too?""
[Message 47] David: ""Could be. The plot thickens.""
[Message 48] Chris: ""We should definitely tell the police this.""
[Message 49] Sarah: ""I'm on it.""
[Message 50] David: ""Good. Let's hope they catch the person responsible. They're going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 51] Chris: ""Seriously.""
[Message 52] Sarah: ""This is insane.""
[Message 53] Bailey: ""Hey guys, what's all the chatter about?""
[Message 54] Chris: ""Just talking about the murders at the Vet Clinic. Crazy, right?""
[Message 55] Bailey: ""Yeah, awful. I can't believe it.""
[Message 56] Sarah: ""David mentioned you bought some rope recently, Bailey.""
[Message 57] Bailey: ""Oh, yeah. I'm starting a new weaving project. It's none of your business, Sarah. Why do you have to be so nosy?""
[Message 58] Chris: ""Just curious, Bailey. No need to get defensive.""
[Message 59] Bailey: ""I'm not defensive. I just don't appreciate being interrogated.""
[Message 60] David: ""Chill out, Bailey. No one's interrogating you.""
[Message 61] Bailey: ""Easy for you to say, David. You're not the one being put on the spot.""
[Message 62] Sarah: ""Okay, let's just drop it. Bailey, did you know either of the victims?""
[Message 63] Bailey: ""I knew Taylor vaguely. We ran into each other at a coffee shop sometimes. He was always really nice.""
[Message 64] Chris: ""Did you know Jordan?""
[Message 65] Bailey: ""No, never heard of him.""
[Message 66] Sarah: ""Alright. Thanks, Bailey.""
[Message 67] Bailey: ""Sure. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a weaving project to get back to.""
[Message 68] Chris: ""Alright, bye.""
[Message 69] Sarah: ""Later.""
[Message 70] David: ""See ya.""
[Message 71] Chris: ""Bailey is acting really strange. Definitely something there.""
[Message 72] Sarah: ""I agree. The defensiveness is a red flag.""
[Message 73] David: ""Maybe she's just nervous because of the rope thing.""
[Message 74] Chris: ""Maybe. But I don't buy it.""
[Message 75] Sarah: ""Me neither. I'm going to look into Bailey's background a bit more.""
[Message 76] Chris: ""Good idea. I'll see if I can find anything else about Alex and Taylor.""
[Message 77] David: ""Okay, team effort. Let's crack this case.""
[Message 78] Alex: ""Hey guys, what's up?""
[Message 79] Chris: ""Hey Alex. Just talking about the Vet Clinic murders. Rough stuff.""
[Message 80] Alex: ""Yeah, terrible. I can't believe it.""
[Message 81] Sarah: ""Alex, did you know Taylor well?""
[Message 82] Alex: ""I knew her, yeah. She used to work at my company. But I thought it was a bit harsh when I fired her.""
[Message 83] Chris: ""What was she like?""
[Message 84] Alex: ""She was okay. Really stubborn. Always butting heads with management.""
[Message 85] David: ""Did you have any issues with Jordan, the journalist?""
[Message 86] Alex: ""Jordan? Nah, never met him. Why?""
[Message 87] Sarah: ""Just curious. You seemed pretty upset about something last week.""
[Message 88] Alex: ""I was stressed about work. Deadline, that's all.""
[Message 89] Chris: ""Right. Well, hope you're doing okay.""
[Message 90] Alex: ""Yeah, I'm fine. Just trying to process everything. Hope they don't get the death penalty.""
[Message 91] David: ""Me too. Justice should be served, but...""
[Message 92] Sarah: ""Agreed. Well, gotta run. Talk later.""
[Message 93] Chris: ""Later.""
[Message 94] David: ""Bye.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""See ya.""
[Message 96] Chris: ""Alex seems genuinely shocked. I'm starting to doubt he had anything to do with it.""
[Message 97] Sarah: ""Maybe. But he's a good actor. And he was talking about hurting her right before he went over there.""
[Message 98] David: ""True. This is so confusing.""
[Message 99] Chris: ""We need more concrete evidence.""
[Message 100] Sarah: ""I agree. I'm going to check social media. See if anyone posted anything suspicious around the time of the murders.""
[Message 101] Chris: ""Good idea. I'll look into Alex's alibi for late evening.""
[Message 102] David: ""I'll try to find out more about Bailey's rope project.""
[Message 103] Sarah: ""Teamwork makes the dream work.""
[Message 104] Chris: ""Let's hope so.""
[Message 105] David: ""Fingers crossed.""
[Message 106] Sarah: ""Guys, I found something. A tweet from Bailey saying, ""Time to tie up loose ends."" Posted right before the murders.""
[Message 107] Chris: ""Holy crap. That's pretty damning.""
[Message 108] David: ""Wow. Okay, Bailey is definitely looking like the prime suspect now.""
[Message 109] Sarah: ""I think we need to go to the police with this ASAP.""
[Message 110] Chris: ""Agreed. This is beyond our pay grade now.""
[Message 111] David: ""I'm already calling them.""

[Message 113] Chris: ""Let's hope so. This has been a nightmare.""

[Message 116] Chris: ""Awesome. Finally, some progress.""
[Message 117] Sarah: ""I feel a little bad for Bailey, but... two people are dead.""
[Message 118] Chris: ""Yeah, it's a tragic situation all around.""
[Message 119] David: ""Well, at least we did our part to help bring her to justice.""
[Message 120] Sarah: ""True. Hopefully, this will bring some closure to the families of the victims.""
[Message 121] Chris: ""Amen to that.""
[Message 122] David: ""Definitely.""

[Message 124] Chris: ""They're looking into Bailey. She posted something suspicious online.""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Bailey? Wow. I never would have suspected her.""
[Message 126] Sarah: ""Yeah, it's crazy. You never know who's capable of what.""
[Message 127] Alex: ""True. This whole thing is just... unsettling.""
[Message 128] David: ""Tell me about it.""
[Message 129] Chris: ""Well, hopefully, they'll get to the bottom of it soon.""

[Message 132] Chris: ""Anytime.""
[Message 133] David: ""Take care.""
[Message 134] Alex: ""You too.""
[Message 135] Sarah: ""So, do we think they got the right person?""
[Message 136] Chris: ""It seems like a pretty open-and-shut case with that tweet.""
[Message 137] David: ""Yeah, I think so. Unless there's some major twist we don't know about.""
[Message 138] Sarah: ""Hopefully not. I'm ready for this whole thing to be over.""

[Message 2] Jamie: Team meeting, remember? They said it was urgent. Something about quarterly goals.
[Message 3] Carol: Urgent at 2 AM? Seems a bit much.
[Message 4] Alex: Tell me about it. I could be sleeping.
[Message 5] Jamie: Well, maybe they have good news? Or at least good coffee.
[Message 6] Carol: Hope so. I need some serious caffeine to deal with whatever this is.
[Message 7] Alex: So, anyone got any personal goals they're chasing right now? Besides sleep, obviously.
[Message 8] Jamie: I’m trying to get back into basketball. My knees are protesting, though.
[Message 9] Carol: That's ambitious, Jamie! Good for you. I'm aiming to finally organize my closet. It's a disaster zone.
[Message 10] Alex: Closet organization sounds…manageable. I’m trying to read more about current events. Trying to stay informed, you know?
[Message 11] Jamie: Current events are pretty depressing these days, Alex. I prefer focusing on what I can control. Like my free throws.
[Message 12] Carol: I hear you, Jamie. Sometimes it's good to escape the news. What kind of basketball are you playing? Indoor? Outdoor?
[Message 13] Jamie: Mostly indoor. There's a court near my place.
[Message 14] Alex: I wish I had the energy for sports. I mostly just cook. Thinking of trying a new soup recipe this week.
[Message 15] Carol: Ooh, what kind of soup? I love soup!
[Message 16] Alex: Thinking of a spicy butternut squash. Something to warm me up.
[Message 17] Jamie: Sounds good! I’m more of a chili guy myself.
[Message 18] Carol: Okay, now I want soup AND chili. This meeting better hurry up.
[Message 19] Alex: Seriously. I’m starving.
[Message 20] Jamie: Did anyone bring snacks?
[Message 21] Carol: Nope. I assumed there would be something here. I was wrong.
[Message 22] Alex: Me too. Rookie mistake.
[Message 23] Jamie: You know, I saw a guy wearing some cool sneakers earlier. They looked really comfortable.
[Message 24] Carol: Oh? What brand? I'm always on the lookout for new comfortable shoes.
[Message 25] Jamie: I don't remember, but they were gray and had a thick sole. Looked like good support.
[Message 26] Carol: I'll keep an eye out. My feet are killing me in these heels.
[Message 27] Alex: Heels? At 2 AM? You're dedicated, Carol.
[Message 28] Carol: Hey, you never know who you might run into. Plus, they match my dress. (Mostly).
[Message 29] Jamie: Fair enough. Comfort trumps fashion for me these days.
[Message 30] Alex: Agreed. I'm all about practicality.
[Message 31] Carol: So, back to personal goals... Anyone else have any? Besides basketball, closet organization, and soup-making?
[Message 32] Jamie: I also want to learn a new language. Maybe Spanish?
[Message 33] Alex: Spanish is a good choice. Lots of resources available.
[Message 34] Carol: I've always wanted to learn how to play the guitar.
[Message 35] Jamie: Never too late to start!
[Message 36] Alex: True. I might pick up my old flute again. Haven't played in years.
[Message 37] Carol: A flute! That's awesome, Alex.
[Message 38] Jamie: We could start a band!
[Message 39] Alex: Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Jamie.
[Message 40] Carol: I'm in if we're terrible. Adds to the charm.
[Message 41] Jamie: Haha! Exactly.
[Message 42] Alex: I'm picturing us playing in this waiting room. Very avant-garde.
[Message 43] Carol: We’d be famous! Or infamous.
[Message 44] Jamie: Either way, we’d get out of this meeting.
[Message 45] Alex: Good point.
[Message 46] Carol: Seriously though, I'm going to look into guitar lessons. Maybe online?
[Message 47] Jamie: Online lessons are great. Flexible schedule.
[Message 48] Alex: YouTube is your friend. Though be prepared for a lot of beginner tutorials.
[Message 49] Carol: I'm prepared. I have patience. (Most of the time).
[Message 50] Jamie: That's the spirit!
[Message 51] Alex: So, anyone have any predictions for this meeting?
[Message 52] Carol: Budget cuts. Definitely budget cuts.
[Message 53] Jamie: Probably. Or a new initiative that requires us to work even more overtime.
[Message 54] Alex: Ugh, don't even say that.
[Message 55] Carol: Maybe they're giving us a bonus? (I can dream, right?)
[Message 56] Jamie: I admire your optimism, Carol.
[Message 57] Alex: Okay, now I'm craving a bonus.
[Message 58] Carol: See? Manifesting it.
[Message 59] Jamie: I'm going to manifest a winning lottery ticket while we're at it.
[Message 60] Alex: Good plan. We can split the winnings three ways.
[Message 61] Carol: Deal. I'll buy us all new guitars.
[Message 62] Jamie: And I'll buy us all comfortable shoes.
[Message 63] Alex: And I'll cook us a celebratory meal.
[Message 64] Carol: Perfect! We have a plan.
[Message 65] Jamie: Okay, so, lottery numbers… anyone have any lucky numbers?
[Message 66] Alex: I always liked 7.
[Message 67] Carol: 13 for me.
[Message 68] Jamie: 22.
[Message 69] Alex: We need more than three numbers, Jamie.
[Message 70] Jamie: Uh… 3 and 16?
[Message 71] Carol: And 42. Final answer.
[Message 72] Alex: Alright, we’re set. If we win, remember this conversation.
[Message 73] Carol: Absolutely. I have it saved.
[Message 74] Jamie: Me too.
[Message 75] Alex: Speaking of saving things, I really need to back up my computer. It’s been nagging me for weeks.
[Message 76] Carol: Data loss is the worst! I lost a bunch of photos once. Devastating.
[Message 77] Jamie: Cloud storage is your friend, Alex.
[Message 78] Alex: I know, I know. I just need to actually do it.
[Message 79] Carol: Put it on your personal goals list! “Back up computer.”
[Message 80] Alex: Ugh, fine. Added.
[Message 81] Jamie: See? Progress!
[Message 82] Carol: We’re all improving!
[Message 83] Alex: This meeting is already more productive than I expected.

[Message 24] Casey: ""Paddington is adorable! I'd watch that.""
[Message 25] Drew: ""Okay, I'm intrigued by 'The Princess Bride' and 'Paddington'. Maybe I'll flip a coin.""
[Message 26] Emily: ""Good choices, Drew! Either way, you're in for a good time.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Hey, does anyone know how to get those red wine stains out of a white shirt? Asking for a friend… who may or may not be me.""
[Message 28] Blake: ""Salt! Immediately cover the stain in salt. It absorbs the wine.""
[Message 29] Casey: ""Vinegar can work too, but test it on a small, inconspicuous area first.""
[Message 30] Drew: ""Good to know! Thanks, guys.""
[Message 31] Emily: ""Okay, back to movies! What about something a little older, like 'Casablanca'?""
[Message 32] Alex: ""Classic! But maybe a bit slow for a midnight viewing, Emily.""
[Message 33] Blake: ""Agreed. 'Casablanca' is a great film, but requires a certain mood.""
[Message 34] Casey: ""True. It's more of a Sunday afternoon movie.""
[Message 35] Drew: ""Okay, the coin landed on... 'The Princess Bride'! Starting it now.""
[Message 36] Emily: ""Yay! Enjoy, Drew!""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Have fun watching, Drew! Inconceivable!""
[Message 38] Blake: ""Have a good night everyone! I'm off to bed.""
[Message 39] Casey: ""Night, Blake!""
[Message 40] Drew: ""Goodnight!""
[Message 41] Emily: ""Sweet dreams, Blake!""
[Message 42] Alex: ""Night Blake. I'm going to catch some highlights from the game today.""
[Message 43] Casey: ""What game was on today, Alex?""
[Message 44] Alex: ""The Cardinals played the Cubs. Close game!""
[Message 45] Casey: ""Ah, I missed that. Maybe I'll catch a replay tomorrow.""
[Message 46] Emily: ""I'm thinking of putting on some music. Anyone have any requests?""
[Message 47] Drew: ""Something chill, maybe?""
[Message 48] Emily: ""Got it! Ambient it is.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Enjoy the music, Emily. I'm out. Night everyone!""
[Message 50] Casey: ""Night, Alex!""
[Message 51] Emily: ""Night, Alex!""
[Message 52] Drew: ""Night!""
[Message 53] Casey: ""Anyone else feel like summer is flying by?""
[Message 54] Emily: ""Definitely. It feels like it just started.""
[Message 55] Drew: ""Too fast. I need more beach time.""
[Message 56] Casey: ""Me too. Maybe we should plan a beach trip before it gets too cold.""
[Message 57] Emily: ""That's a great idea, Casey! I'm in.""
[Message 58] Drew: ""Count me in too!""
[Message 59] Casey: ""Awesome! We can start brainstorming locations tomorrow.""
[Message 60] Emily: ""Sounds good! I'm getting sleepy. Goodnight everyone!""
[Message 61] Casey: ""Night, Emily!""
[Message 62] Drew: ""Goodnight!""
[Message 63] Casey: ""Well, I guess it's just me then. Goodnight internet.""

546,"[Message 1] Alex: Wow, these jellyfish are mesmerizing! Anyone else here for the aquarium's new exhibit?
[Message 2] Ben: Yeah, Alex! Just got here. The hype is real. They're beautiful.
[Message 3] Chris: I'm here too! This whole place is so calming after a long day.
[Message 4] Alex: Totally agree, Chris. Needed this peaceful vibe.
[Message 5] Ben: So, anyone have any complaints about their week? Just looking for a good vent session, haha.
[Message 6] Chris: Haha, Ben, always the comedian. My biggest complaint? My printer keeps jamming.
[Message 7] Alex: Oh man, printers are the worst. Mine refuses to connect to the wifi.
[Message 8] Ben: The wifi...a universal complaint! I swear, it's always acting up during crucial movie nights.
[Message 9] Chris: Speaking of movies, have you guys seen anything good lately?
[Message 10] Alex: I finally watched that new sci-fi flick, ""Astro Wanderers"". Pretty good!
[Message 11] Ben: ""Astro Wanderers""? Adding that to my list. I'm more of a travel documentary guy, myself.
[Message 12] Chris: Travel docs are great! I need some vicarious adventures.
[Message 13] Alex: Back to complaints, though... my main one this week is the teacher-student conference I had.
[Message 14] Ben: Oh no, what happened?
[Message 15] Chris: Teacher-student conferences can be a mixed bag.
[Message 16] Alex: My nephew's teacher seems to think he's a disruptive genius. It was...interesting.
[Message 17] Ben: ""Disruptive genius"" - I love it! Maybe he just needs a more challenging curriculum?
[Message 18] Chris: That's a valid point, Ben. Under-stimulation can lead to disruptive behavior.
[Message 19] Alex: That's what I suggested! But the teacher seemed more focused on the ""disruptive"" part.
[Message 20] Ben: Teachers have such a tough job. Gotta give them some credit.
[Message 21] Chris: Absolutely. It's a thankless job most of the time.
[Message 22] Alex: True, true. I just wish they'd see his potential.
[Message 23] Ben: Maybe offer to volunteer in the classroom? Show your support, get a better understanding?
[Message 24] Chris: That's a smart idea, Ben.
[Message 25] Alex: That's actually a really good idea. I might do that. Thanks!
[Message 26] Ben: No problem, Alex! Glad I could help.
[Message 27] Chris: My other complaint is that the grocery store was out of my favorite kombucha. Tragedy!
[Message 28] Alex: Oh, the kombucha crisis is real!
[Message 29] Ben: I don't even know what kombucha *is*. Am I missing out?
[Message 30] Chris: It's fermented tea. Some people love it, some people hate it. I'm in the ""love it"" camp.
[Message 31] Alex: I'm also a kombucha fan. Try it, Ben! You might be surprised.
[Message 32] Ben: Alright, alright, I'll add it to my grocery list. If I hate it, I'm blaming you two.
[Message 33] Chris: Deal!
[Message 34] Alex: Fair enough!
[Message 35] Ben: So, Alex, what games are you playing these days? Heard you were into gaming.
[Message 36] Alex: Still obsessed with ""Cosmic Crusaders Online."" It's eating all my free time.
[Message 37] Chris: ""Cosmic Crusaders Online""... sounds intense!
[Message 38] Ben: I'm more of a board game kind of guy. Settlers of Catan, anyone?
[Message 39] Alex: Catan is a classic! We should do a board game night sometime.
[Message 40] Chris: I'm in! I'm terrible at Catan, but I enjoy the social aspect.
[Message 41] Ben: Perfect! We'll make it happen.
[Message 42] Alex: This is good. We're resolving complaints AND planning game nights. Efficiency!
[Message 43] Ben: Haha, multi-tasking at its finest!
[Message 44] Chris: Speaking of complaints, gas prices are insane right now.
[Message 45] Alex: Ugh, tell me about it!
[Message 46] Ben: Seriously. Makes me want to take up biking again.
[Message 47] Chris: Maybe we should all invest in electric scooters.
[Message 48] Alex: That's not a bad idea, actually.
[Message 49] Ben: I'd look ridiculous on an electric scooter. But I appreciate the thought.
[Message 50] Chris: Haha, I think you'd rock it, Ben.
[Message 51] Alex: Yeah, own it!
[Message 52] Ben: Alright, alright, maybe I'll consider it.
[Message 53] Chris: My biggest complaint with my apartment is the paper-thin walls.
[Message 54] Alex: Oh, I feel your pain. I can hear my neighbor's entire life story.
[Message 55] Ben: That sounds awful!
[Message 56] Chris: It is. Especially when they decide to have karaoke night at 2 AM.
[Message 57] Alex: Karaoke night at 2 AM? That's grounds for war!
[Message 58] Ben: Definitely. Maybe try a white noise machine?
[Message 59] Chris: I've tried everything. Earplugs, white noise, even passive-aggressive notes.
[Message 60] Alex: Passive-aggressive notes are the best.
[Message 61] Ben: Haha! Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
[Message 62] Chris: Exactly.
[Message 63] Alex: Okay, my turn for a complaint... my cat keeps waking me up at 4 AM demanding food.
[Message 64] Ben: Classic cat behavior!
[Message 65] Chris: They're basically furry alarm clocks.
[Message 66] Alex: Exactly! An adorable, demanding, furry alarm clock.
[Message 67] Ben: Maybe an automatic feeder would help?
[Message 68] Chris: That's a good idea, Ben!
[Message 69] Alex: I've thought about it. Maybe it's time to invest.
[Message 70] Ben: Do it! Your sleep will thank you.
[Message 71] Chris: Agreed. Sleep is precious.
[Message 72] Alex: Okay, okay, you've convinced me. Automatic feeder, here I come!
[Message 73] Ben: Success! Another problem solved.
[Message 74] Chris: This complaint session is surprisingly productive.
[Message 75] Alex: I know, right? I feel much better already.
[Message 76] Ben: Me too! Venting is therapeutic.
[Message 77] Chris: Speaking of therapy...anyone watch that new drama series, ""Mind Games""?
[Message 78] Alex: No, but I've heard good things!
[Message 79] Ben: I'm more of a comedy person myself. Need a good laugh after a long day.
[Message 80] Chris: I get that. Laughter is the best medicine.
[Message 81] Alex: Agreed. I need to find a new comedy series. Any recommendations?
[Message 82] Ben: ""Parks and Recreation"" is always a good choice.
[Message 83] Chris: ""The Good Place"" is hilarious and thought-provoking.
[Message 84] Alex: ""Parks and Rec"" is a classic! I'll check out ""The Good Place."" Thanks!
[Message 85] Ben: No problem! Glad to help.
[Message 86] Chris: My complaint? My neighbor's dog barks incessantly.
[Message 87] Alex: Oh man, that's annoying.
[Message 88] Ben: Have you talked to your neighbor about it?
[Message 89] Chris: I've tried, but they don't seem to care.
[Message 90] Alex: That's so frustrating.
[Message 91] Ben: Maybe try contacting your landlord?
[Message 92] Chris: I might have to. It's really affecting my sleep.
[Message 93] Alex: Definitely worth a shot.
[Message 94] Ben: Agreed. Your well-being is important.
[Message 95] Chris: Thanks, guys. I appreciate the support.
[Message 96] Alex: Of course! We're here for you.
[Message 97] Ben: Always!
[Message 98] Alex: Okay, my turn. My biggest complaint is the amount of junk mail I get.
[Message 99] Ben: Ugh, junk mail is the worst.
[Message 100] Chris: So wasteful!
[Message 101] Alex: I know, right? I swear, it's like they're trying to kill the planet.
[Message 102] Ben: You can opt out of some of it online.
[Message 103] Chris: True! There are websites dedicated to stopping junk mail.
[Message 104] Alex: I'll have to look into that. Thanks for the tip!
[Message 105] Ben: No problem! Anything to save the trees.
[Message 106] Chris: Agreed.
[Message 107] Alex: So, Ben, you mentioned traveling. Where are you planning to go next?
[Message 108] Ben: Thinking about Iceland! The landscape looks incredible.
[Message 109] Chris: Iceland is on my bucket list!
[Message 110] Alex: Wow, Iceland sounds amazing!
[Message 111] Ben: It does, doesn't it? Hoping to go next spring.
[Message 112] Chris: I'd love to see the Northern Lights someday.
[Message 113] Alex: Me too! That would be an unforgettable experience.
[Message 114] Ben: Fingers crossed!
[Message 115] Chris: Okay, my last complaint: I can't find matching socks.
[Message 116] Alex: The eternal struggle!
[Message 117] Ben: I just buy all the same kind of socks. Problem solved.
[Message 118] Chris: That's genius, Ben!
[Message 119] Alex: Seriously! Why didn't I think of that?
[Message 120] Ben: Because I'm a data analyst and I like efficiency.
[Message 121] Chris: Makes sense!
[Message 122] Alex: Okay, I'm going to do that. All black socks from now on.
[Message 123] Ben: You won't regret it.
[Message 124] Chris: Agreed.
[Message 125] Alex: Well, this has been a surprisingly therapeutic complaint session.
[Message 126] Ben: Definitely! Feel much lighter.
[Message 127] Chris: Me too! Thanks for listening, guys.
[Message 128] Alex: Anytime!
[Message 129] Ben: Always here to lend an ear. Or two.
[Message 130] Chris: Haha!
[Message 131] Alex: Okay, I'm feeling inspired to actually tackle some of these problems.
[Message 132] Ben: Go for it! You got this.
[Message 133] Chris: Yeah, take action!
[Message 134] Alex: First step: ordering an automatic cat feeder.
[Message 135] Ben: Excellent choice!
[Message 136] Chris: Your cat will thank you... eventually.
[Message 137] Alex: Haha, probably not. But I'll thank myself.
[Message 138] Ben: True!
[Message 139] Chris: Well, it's getting late. I should probably head home.
[Message 140] Alex: Yeah, me too.
[Message 141] Ben: Agreed. It was great seeing you guys!
[Message 142] Alex: You too, Ben! And thanks again for the advice.
[Message 143] Chris: Yeah, thanks Ben! And Alex, it was good seeing you.
[Message 144] Ben: Anytime, guys! Drive safe!
[Message 145] Alex: You too!
[Message 146] Chris: Will do!
[Message 147] Alex: Okay, bye!
[Message 148] Ben: Later!
[Message 149] Chris: Bye!
[Message 150] Alex: Just ordered the automatic feeder!
[Message 151] Ben: Nice!
[Message 152] Chris: Awesome!
[Message 153] Alex: Feeling accomplished!
[Message 154] Ben: You should!
[Message 155] Chris: Victory!
[Message 156] Alex: Now, to tackle the junk mail situation...
[Message 157] Ben: You can do it!
[Message 158] Chris: One step at a time!
[Message 159] Alex: Exactly!
[Message 160] Ben: Well, I'm going to start researching Iceland trips.
[Message 161] Chris: Have fun!
[Message 162] Alex: Sounds like a good way to spend the evening.
[Message 163] Ben: It does!
[Message 164] Chris: Okay, officially signing off. Goodnight!
[Message 165] Alex: Goodnight, Chris!
[Message 166] Ben: Goodnight!
[Message 167] Alex: Goodnight, Ben!
[Message 168] Alex: Maybe we can do this again next week.
[Message 169] Ben: Sounds good!
[Message 170] Alex: Perfect!",0,
547,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone, how's it going? Waiting long?
[Message 2] Jordan: Not too bad, Alex. Just got here. You?
[Message 3] Casey: A little while, but it's fine. Ready to head home after that book club discussion.
[Message 4] Alex: Book club? What were you reading this time?
[Message 5] Casey: ""All the King's Men"" by Robert Penn Warren. Pretty heavy stuff, especially with everything going on in politics these days.
[Message 6] Jordan: Politics? Ugh, don't even get me started. I'm so tired of it all.
[Message 7] Alex: I hear you, Jordan. It's a constant barrage. What specifically is getting to you?
[Message 8] Jordan: Just the constant arguing, the negativity. It feels like nobody is listening to each other anymore.
[Message 9] Casey: I agree. The book really highlighted how easily things can spiral out of control when people stop communicating.
[Message 10] Alex: That's interesting. I haven't read that one. Is it worth the read? My reading list is embarrassingly short lately. Mostly car magazines, haha.
[Message 11] Jordan: Car magazines, huh? What are you working on these days, Alex?
[Message 12] Alex: Trying to get my hands on a vintage Mustang. Dream car, you know?
[Message 13] Casey: ""All the King's Men"" is definitely worth it, Alex. Especially if you're interested in the human side of politics.
[Message 14] Jordan: Maybe I should pick it up too. I need a break from doomscrolling.
[Message 15] Alex: Doomscrolling is the worst. I try to limit my time on social media because of it.
[Message 16] Casey: Me too. It's a constant stream of negativity.
[Message 17] Jordan: Exactly! So, Casey, what was the main takeaway from the book club discussion?
[Message 18] Casey: We talked a lot about the corrupting influence of power and how easily good intentions can be twisted.
[Message 19] Alex: Sounds intense.
[Message 20] Jordan: It does. Makes you think about the people in charge, doesn't it?
[Message 21] Casey: Absolutely. We debated whether the main character was ultimately a good or bad person.
[Message 22] Alex: See, that's where I get lost. Everything feels so gray these days. No clear good guys or bad guys.
[Message 23] Jordan: Precisely! It's all shades of gray.
[Message 24] Casey: That's a good way to put it, Alex. The book definitely reflects that.
[Message 25] Alex: What's your take, Casey? Good or bad guy?
[Message 26] Casey: I think he started with good intentions, but the pursuit of power corrupted him.
[Message 27] Jordan: A classic tale. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[Message 28] Alex: So, what's the solution? Just give up on politics altogether?
[Message 29] Jordan: I wish it were that simple.
[Message 30] Casey: I don't think giving up is the answer. We need to stay informed and engaged.
[Message 31] Alex: Easier said than done, right?
[Message 32] Jordan: Totally. It's exhausting!
[Message 33] Casey: It is, but we can't afford to be apathetic.
[Message 34] Alex: I guess. I try to focus on local politics more. Feels like I can actually make a difference there.
[Message 35] Jordan: That's a good point, Alex. Local issues are often more tangible.
[Message 36] Casey: I agree. Local politics can have a direct impact on our lives.
[Message 37] Alex: Plus, less of the national drama.
[Message 38] Jordan: Amen to that!
[Message 39] Casey: Did you guys hear about the new city council proposal for the park downtown?
[Message 40] Alex: Vaguely. Something about renovations?
[Message 41] Jordan: Yeah, I saw something about that online.
[Message 42] Casey: They're planning to add a new playground and walking trails.
[Message 43] Alex: That sounds good. The playground is pretty run down.
[Message 44] Jordan: It is. My grandkids would love that.
[Message 45] Casey: Exactly! It's a good example of how local politics can improve our community.
[Message 46] Alex: So, are you guys in favor of it?
[Message 47] Jordan: I think so. Seems like a positive development.
[Message 48] Casey: I am. I'm planning to attend the next city council meeting to voice my support.
[Message 49] Alex: Good for you, Casey!
[Message 50] Jordan: That's the spirit!
[Message 51] Casey: We need more people to get involved at the local level.
[Message 52] Alex: Alright, alright, you're inspiring me. Maybe I'll check it out too.
[Message 53] Jordan: Me too, maybe. If I can figure out the online meeting link. Technology, ugh!
[Message 54] Casey: I can help you with that, Jordan.
[Message 55] Jordan: That would be great, Casey, thanks!
[Message 56] Alex: This is a much better topic than national politics, honestly.
[Message 57] Jordan: Absolutely! Let's stick to parks and playgrounds.
[Message 58] Casey: Agreed. More positive vibes.
[Message 59] Alex: So, Jordan, what kind of technology are you into these days? Besides the begrudgingly used kind?
[Message 60] Jordan: Self-driving cars, mostly. Fascinated by the concept.
[Message 61] Casey: Oh, interesting!
[Message 62] Alex: Yeah, those are wild. Think they'll ever be truly safe?
[Message 63] Jordan: I think so, eventually. It's just a matter of time and development.
[Message 64] Casey: The ethical implications are fascinating too. Who's responsible if there's an accident?
[Message 65] Alex: Exactly! Big can of worms.
[Message 66] Jordan: That's a good point, Casey. Lots to consider.
[Message 67] Alex: I'd still be nervous letting a computer drive me around. Give me a steering wheel any day.
[Message 68] Jordan: I understand the hesitation, but I think they'll ultimately be safer than human drivers.
[Message 69] Casey: Maybe. I'm still on the fence.
[Message 70] Alex: Speaking of cars, I saw a beautiful '67 Shelby Mustang the other day. Almost drooled.
[Message 71] Jordan: Oh man, those are gorgeous.
[Message 72] Casey: I appreciate a classic car.
[Message 73] Alex: This one was pristine. Perfect condition. Asking price was insane though.
[Message 74] Jordan: I bet. Those things are collector's items.
[Message 75] Casey: A true piece of art.
[Message 76] Alex: One day... I'll have one.
[Message 77] Jordan: Keep dreaming, Alex!
[Message 78] Casey: You never know!
[Message 79] Alex: What about you, Casey? Anything you're dreaming of these days? Besides well-funded parks?
[Message 80] Casey: Haha! I'm hoping to start a small community garden in my neighborhood.
[Message 81] Jordan: That's a wonderful idea!
[Message 82] Alex: That's awesome, Casey!
[Message 83] Casey: I think it would be a great way to bring people together.
[Message 84] Jordan: It would! And provide fresh produce.
[Message 85] Alex: Count me in if you need any help. I'm not much of a gardener, but I can lift heavy things.
[Message 86] Casey: That's so kind of you, Alex! I might take you up on that.
[Message 87] Jordan: I can donate some tools. I have a few extra in the garage.
[Message 88] Casey: That's amazing, Jordan! Thank you!
[Message 89] Alex: See? Community effort!
[Message 90] Jordan: Exactly! Working together to make a difference.
[Message 91] Casey: This is what I love about our city.
[Message 92] Alex: Amarillo's got its charms, that's for sure.
[Message 93] Jordan: Definitely does.
[Message 94] Casey: Well, I think I see my bus coming.
[Message 95] Alex: Safe travels, Casey!
[Message 96] Jordan: Goodnight, Casey!
[Message 97] Casey: Goodnight, guys! It was nice chatting.
[Message 98] Alex: You too!
[Message 99] Jordan: Likewise!
[Message 100] Alex: So, Jordan, still interested in those self-driving cars even after our ethical debate?
[Message 101] Jordan: Absolutely. The potential benefits are too great to ignore.
[Message 102] Alex: I guess. I'm still skeptical.
[Message 103] Jordan: I understand. It's a big leap of faith.
[Message 104] Alex: Maybe I'll come around eventually.
[Message 105] Jordan: Maybe. Or maybe I'll be driving you around in one someday!
[Message 106] Alex: Haha! I'll hold you to that.
[Message 107] Jordan: Deal!
[Message 108] Alex: Hey, did you see that article about the new tech startup downtown?
[Message 109] Jordan: No, I missed that. What's it about?
[Message 110] Alex: They're developing some kind of AI software.
[Message 111] Jordan: Interesting. What for?
[Message 112] Alex: I think it's related to data analysis.
[Message 113] Jordan: Could be useful.
[Message 114] Alex: Yeah, maybe. Or maybe it's another Skynet in the making.
[Message 115] Jordan: Haha! Don't worry, I'll protect you from the robots.
[Message 116] Alex: I appreciate that, Jordan.
[Message 117] Jordan: Anytime!
[Message 118] Alex: This late bus is taking forever...
[Message 119] Jordan: I know, right?
[Message 120] Alex: Maybe I should just start walking.
[Message 121] Jordan: Where do you live?
[Message 122] Alex: About a mile from here.
[Message 123] Jordan: That's not too bad.
[Message 124] Alex: Still... I'm lazy.
[Message 125] Jordan: I understand.
[Message 126] Alex: Plus, it's kind of creepy out here.
[Message 127] Jordan: True. Stay safe.
[Message 128] Alex: I will. Thanks.
[Message 129] Jordan: Maybe try that new ride-sharing app?
[Message 130] Alex: You know, I completely forgot about that.
[Message 131] Jordan: Give it a shot.
[Message 132] Alex: Alright, I will. Thanks for the reminder.
[Message 133] Jordan: No problem!
[Message 134] Alex: It's still weird to think about getting into a stranger's car.
[Message 135] Jordan: I know, but they have background checks and ratings.
[Message 136] Alex: True. I guess it's no different than a taxi, really.
[Message 137] Jordan: Exactly.
[Message 138] Alex: Alright, I'm gonna try it.
[Message 139] Jordan: Let me know how it goes.
[Message 140] Alex: Will do.
[Message 141] Jordan: Hopefully it's not too expensive.
[Message 142] Alex: Yeah, that's my main concern.
[Message 143] Jordan: Everything is so expensive these days.
[Message 144] Alex: Tell me about it. Gas prices are insane.
[Message 145] Jordan: And groceries!
[Message 146] Alex: It's a struggle.
[Message 147] Jordan: I'm living on a fixed income, so it's even tougher.
[Message 148] Alex: I can imagine.
[Message 149] Jordan: We need some real change.
[Message 150] Alex: That's for sure.
[Message 151] Jordan: I'm not sure what the answer is, though.
[Message 152] Alex: Me neither. It feels like we're just spinning our wheels.
[Message 153] Jordan: Exactly.
[Message 154] Alex: Maybe Casey is right. Maybe we need to focus on local issues.
[Message 155] Jordan: It's a start.
[Message 156] Alex: At least we can see the direct impact of our actions.
[Message 157] Jordan: True.
[Message 158] Alex: Okay, ride is here. Wish me luck!
[Message 159] Jordan: Good luck, Alex! Be safe!
[Message 160] Alex: Thanks! Talk to you later.
[Message 161] Jordan: Sounds good. Goodnight!
[Message 162] Alex: Night!
[Message 163] Jordan: Well, that was a conversation.
[Message 164] Jordan: Now, to wait for my bus... which is probably late too.
[Message 165] Jordan: I should probably get some sleep.
[Message 166] Jordan: But I'm not tired.
[Message 167] Jordan: Maybe I'll just scroll through some tech news.

[Message 9] David: ""True. Speaking of options, are you still mentoring that new guy, Kevin?""
[Message 10] Martha: ""Yep! Kevin's doing great, actually. Real quick learner.""
[Message 11] David: ""Glad to hear it. Always good to see fresh talent.""
[Message 12] Martha: ""He reminds me of myself when I started out. Eager, a little overwhelmed, but full of potential.""
[Message 13] David: ""Haha, I remember those days. Just trying to figure out which end was up.""
[Message 14] Martha: ""Exactly! Anyway, back to dinner... El Pueblo sounds good, right?""
[Message 15] David: ""Absolutely. El Pueblo it is. See you there in, say, half an hour?""
[Message 16] Martha: ""Perfect! I'll try to get a head start if this traffic clears up.""
[Message 17] David: ""Sounds good. Drive safe.""
[Message 18] Martha: ""You too, David!""
[Message 19] David: ""Just got out of the meeting. Ugh, what a drag.""
[Message 20] Martha: ""Tell me about it. I had back-to-back performance reviews all afternoon.""
[Message 21] David: ""Ouch. That sounds even worse. Hope everyone got good marks.""
[Message 22] Martha: ""Mostly. A few needed some… constructive criticism.""
[Message 23] David: ""The joys of HR. Okay, I'm officially heading towards El Pueblo now.""
[Message 24] Martha: ""Awesome! I'm crawling along in traffic, but should be there soon.""
[Message 25] David: ""No worries. I'll try to snag a table for us.""
[Message 26] Martha: ""You're the best! Thanks, David.""
[Message 27] David: ""Anything for a fellow sufferer of long meetings. Maybe the enchiladas will help us forget.""
[Message 28] Martha: ""Fingers crossed! I could really use some good food right now.""
[Message 29] David: ""So, El Pueblo... any specific recommendations beyond Maria's enchiladas?""
[Message 30] Martha: ""Hmm, I haven't looked at their menu. Maybe we should just ask the waiter for suggestions?""
[Message 31] David: ""Good plan. Always best to get the local's perspective.""
[Message 32] Martha: ""Exactly. They usually know what's fresh and delicious.""
[Message 33] David: ""Alright, I'm almost there. See a neon sign in the distance.""
[Message 34] Martha: ""That's it! Look for a blue awning.""
[Message 35] David: ""Got it. Blue awning located. Parking looks… challenging.""
[Message 36] Martha: ""Yeah, parking around there can be a nightmare. Just circle the block a few times.""
[Message 37] David: ""I'm on it. Wish me luck. Parking gods, hear my plea!""
[Message 38] Martha: ""Haha! May the parking gods be ever in your favor.""
[Message 39] David: ""Spotted a spot! Hallelujah!""
[Message 40] Martha: ""YES! You are a parking wizard, David.""
[Message 41] David: ""Just lucky, I think. Heading inside now. See you in a few!""
[Message 42] Martha: ""Great! I'm about five minutes away. Traffic is finally easing up.""
[Message 43] David: ""Okay, I'm inside. It's pretty packed, but there's a small table near the window.""
[Message 44] Martha: ""Perfect! Snag it if you can.""
[Message 45] David: ""Done. It's all ours. Though the sun is a little intense through that window.""
[Message 46] Martha: ""We can always ask them to lower the blinds. No biggie.""
[Message 47] David: ""True. Just thinking out loud. So, ready for some Mexican?""
[Message 48] Martha: ""Born ready! I'm starving.""
[Message 49] David: ""Good. Me too. This day has drained me.""
[Message 50] Martha: ""I hear you. Sometimes I think they schedule these meetings just to torture us.""
[Message 51] David: ""Probably. Keeps us on our toes, right?""
[Message 52] Martha: ""Yeah, that's one way to look at it. I prefer thinking they just forgot how to manage time.""
[Message 53] David: ""That's probably the more accurate assessment. I see you!""
[Message 54] Martha: ""Where? I don't see you!""
[Message 55] David: ""By the window. Blue scarf. Waving frantically.""
[Message 56] Martha: ""Oh! Found you! Be right there.""
[Message 57] David: ""Excellent. The enchiladas await.""
[Message 58] Martha: ""Enchiladas, here I come!""
[Message 59] David: ""So glad we did this, Martha. I needed to get out of the house.""
[Message 60] Martha: ""Me too, David. This week has been crazy. A good catch-up is much needed.""
[Message 61] David: ""Speaking of catching up, how's your tennis game been lately?""
[Message 62] Martha: ""Oh, you know, the usual. I win some, I lose some. Mostly I'm just trying to avoid pulling a muscle.""
[Message 63] David: ""Haha! I hear that. Getting older isn't for the faint of heart.""
[Message 64] Martha: ""Tell me about it! I swear, I pulled a muscle just getting out of the car today.""
[Message 65] David: ""Wow! Maybe you should invest in one of those fancy massage chairs.""
[Message 66] Martha: ""That's not a bad idea! I've been eyeing one for ages.""
[Message 67] David: ""Treat yourself! You deserve it after all those performance reviews.""
[Message 68] Martha: ""You're right. Maybe I will. Thanks, David!""
[Message 69] David: ""Anytime! Now, about these enchiladas…""
[Message 70] Martha: ""Right! Focus, Martha, focus! Food is the priority.""
[Message 71] David: ""Exactly. Everything else can wait. Did you decide what you're ordering?""
[Message 72] Martha: ""I'm thinking the chili relleno. I haven't had a good one in ages.""
[Message 73] David: ""Ooh, that sounds delicious. Good choice.""
[Message 74] Martha: ""What about you? Sticking with the enchiladas?""
[Message 75] David: ""Probably. But I might ask the waiter about the specials first.""
[Message 76] Martha: ""Good idea. Never hurts to explore your options.""
[Message 77] David: ""Exactly! You never know what culinary masterpiece you might discover.""
[Message 78] Martha: ""So true. Sometimes the best dishes are the ones you never expect.""
[Message 79] David: ""Waiter's coming! Time to put our order in.""
[Message 80] Martha: ""Alright! Let's do this.""
[Message 81] David: ""Good evening! What are your specials tonight?""
[Message 82] Martha: ""And could you tell us what's good?""
[Message 83] David: ""He recommended the shrimp tacos and the carne asada.""
[Message 84] Martha: ""Shrimp tacos sound interesting…""
[Message 85] David: ""Right? Tempting me to stray from the enchiladas.""
[Message 86] Martha: ""Go for it! Live a little! I'm sticking with the chili relleno though.""
[Message 87] David: ""Okay, okay. You've convinced me. I'll try the shrimp tacos.""
[Message 88] Martha: ""Yay! We can share if you want.""
[Message 89] David: ""That's a great idea! Sharing is caring, as they say.""
[Message 90] Martha: ""Exactly! Okay, order placed. Now we wait.""
[Message 91] David: ""The anticipation is killing me! I'm so hungry.""
[Message 92] Martha: ""Me too! I could eat a horse. Or a very large burrito.""
[Message 93] David: ""Haha! A very large burrito does sound appealing.""
[Message 94] Martha: ""Maybe we should have ordered an appetizer.""
[Message 95] David: ""Too late now! We'll just have to suffer through the hunger pangs.""
[Message 96] Martha: ""It's a hard life, isn't it?""
[Message 97] David: ""The hardest. Hey, you know what I was thinking about earlier?""
[Message 98] Martha: ""What's that?""
[Message 99] David: ""That new jazz club downtown. Have you been?""
[Message 100] Martha: ""No, I haven't! I've heard good things though. Is it any good?""
[Message 101] David: ""I went last weekend. The music was amazing! Really talented musicians.""
[Message 102] Martha: ""Oh, that sounds fun! Maybe we should go sometime.""
[Message 103] David: ""I'd love that! We could make it a double date with Sarah and Tom.""
[Message 104] Martha: ""That sounds perfect! Let's do it soon.""
[Message 105] David: ""I'll check their schedule and see what they're playing next weekend.""
[Message 106] Martha: ""Awesome! Keep me posted.""
[Message 107] David: ""Will do. Our food is here! Finally!""
[Message 108] Martha: ""YES! It looks amazing!""
[Message 109] David: ""Smells incredible too! Let's dig in!""
[Message 110] Martha: ""Bon appétit, David!""
[Message 111] David: ""To good food and good company, Martha!""
[Message 112] Martha: ""This chili relleno is fantastic! The sauce is perfect.""
[Message 113] David: ""The shrimp tacos are pretty good too! The shrimp is nice and plump.""
[Message 114] Martha: ""Told you! Fresno has some hidden culinary gems.""
[Message 115] David: ""Definitely. We need to explore more of them.""
[Message 116] Martha: ""Agreed! We can make it a regular thing.""
[Message 117] David: ""I'm in! Dinner club, just you and me.""
[Message 118] Martha: ""I like the sound of that. Dinner club, it is!""
[Message 119] David: ""So, on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate this meal?""
[Message 120] Martha: ""I'd give it an 8.5. Really good, but not quite perfect.""
[Message 121] David: ""I'd say a solid 8. The tacos were tasty, but could have used a little more spice.""
[Message 122] Martha: ""Fair enough. Next time we'll have to ask for extra hot sauce.""
[Message 123] David: ""Absolutely! Always good to have options.""
[Message 124] Martha: ""Exactly. What do you say we order some dessert?""
[Message 125] David: ""Dessert? You read my mind! What are you thinking?""
[Message 126] Martha: ""I saw they have churros with chocolate sauce.""
[Message 127] David: ""Churros! Yes! Perfect ending to the meal.""
[Message 128] Martha: ""Okay, let's flag down the waiter.""
[Message 129] David: ""Already on it. Waiter! Churros, please!""
[Message 130] Martha: ""He's coming! Get ready for some sugary goodness.""
[Message 131] David: ""I'm ready! Bring on the churros!""
[Message 132] Martha: ""These churros look amazing! Crispy and golden brown.""
[Message 133] David: ""And the chocolate sauce smells divine! Let's dive in!""
[Message 134] Martha: ""These are the best churros I've had in ages!""
[Message 135] David: ""I agree! Perfectly cooked and the chocolate sauce is rich and decadent.""
[Message 136] Martha: ""This was exactly what I needed after a long day.""
[Message 137] David: ""Me too. Good food, good company, and good churros. Can't ask for much more.""
[Message 138] Martha: ""Couldn't agree more. Thanks for suggesting this place, David.""
[Message 139] David: ""My pleasure, Martha. We should do this again soon.""
[Message 140] Martha: ""Definitely! Dinner club, here we come!""
[Message 141] David: ""So, ready to head out?""
[Message 142] Martha: ""Almost. Just finishing up the last of the chocolate sauce.""
[Message 143] David: ""Haha! I understand. No chocolate sauce left behind.""
[Message 144] Martha: ""Exactly! Okay, I'm done. Let's get the bill.""
[Message 145] David: ""Sounds good. Waiter! Bill, please!""
[Message 146] Martha: ""This was a great evening, David. Thanks again.""
[Message 147] David: ""Anytime, Martha. It was good to catch up. And the food was excellent.""
[Message 148] Martha: ""Definitely a winner! We'll have to add El Pueblo to our dinner club rotation.""
[Message 149] David: ""Absolutely! So, shall we split the bill?""
[Message 150] Martha: ""Sounds fair to me. I'll grab it. You got parking.""
[Message 151] David: ""Perfect. Thanks, Martha! I appreciate it.""
[Message 152] Martha: ""No problem, David! Always a pleasure.""
[Message 153] David: ""Alright, ready to head back to reality?""
[Message 154] Martha: ""As ready as I'll ever be. See you at the office tomorrow!""
[Message 155] David: ""Sounds good! Have a great night, Martha",0,
553,"[Message 1] Alex: Good morning, everyone! Anyone else excited for some gardening this weekend?
[Message 2] Blake: Morning, Alex! Absolutely. I'm finally getting around to planting those tomatoes.
[Message 3] Casey: Morning! My roses are looking a little sad. Any tips?
[Message 4] Dale: Morning all. Gardening, huh? I'm more of a ""watch the grass grow"" kind of guy.
[Message 5] Erin: Morning! Casey, have you tried Epsom salts for your roses? Works wonders.
[Message 6] Alex: Erin, that's a great idea! I'll have to try that.
[Message 7] Blake: Epsom salts? Never heard of that for roses. Interesting!
[Message 8] Casey: Epsom salts, got it! Thanks, Erin. I'll give it a shot.
[Message 9] Dale: So, anyone seen that new superhero movie?
[Message 10] Erin: Dale, always off-topic! Just kidding. No, haven't seen it yet.
[Message 11] Alex: Dale, focus on the plants! Haha. Movie later.
[Message 12] Blake: Back to gardening – what kind of soil are you all using for your veggies?
[Message 13] Casey: I'm using a mix of compost and potting soil. Seems to be working okay.
[Message 14] Dale: I'm using whatever the landscapers put in. Seems to work for the weeds!
[Message 15] Erin: I amend my garden soil with compost and aged manure. My tomatoes love it.
[Message 16] Alex: I've been experimenting with raised beds this year. So far, so good.
[Message 17] Blake: Raised beds are a good idea. Keeps the slugs away.
[Message 18] Casey: Slugs are the bane of my existence!
[Message 19] Dale: I just let the birds take care of the slugs. Circle of life!
[Message 20] Erin: True, Dale. Nature's pest control.
[Message 21] Alex: Anyone having trouble with squash bugs this year?
[Message 22] Blake: Not yet, thankfully. But I'm keeping a close eye on my zucchini.
[Message 23] Casey: Squash bugs are relentless. I usually hand-pick them.
[Message 24] Dale: Hand-picking? Sounds like torture.
[Message 25] Erin: A little tedious, but effective. Or you can try companion planting.
[Message 26] Alex: Companion planting? Tell me more.
[Message 27] Blake: Yeah, what plants work well together to deter pests?
[Message 28] Casey: I think marigolds are supposed to help with certain pests.
[Message 29] Dale: Marigolds are pretty, anyway.
[Message 30] Erin: Marigolds, basil, nasturtiums… Lots of options! Research companion planting.
[Message 31] Alex: Will do, Erin. Thanks!
[Message 32] Blake: Thanks for the tips, everyone. I need to head out, but happy gardening!
[Message 33] Casey: Bye, Blake!
[Message 34] Dale: Later!
[Message 35] Erin: Have a good one, Blake!
[Message 36] Alex: See ya, Blake.
[Message 37] Alex: So, Dale, anything exciting happening with you?
[Message 38] Dale: Nothing much. Just waiting for my granddaughter's job interview results.
[Message 39] Casey: Oh, good luck to her! What kind of job is it?
[Message 40] Erin: Good luck to your granddaughter, Dale!
[Message 41] Alex: Fingers crossed for her, Dale.
[Message 42] Dale: Thanks, everyone! It's for a data analyst position.
[Message 43] Casey: Data analyst, that's a good field to be in.
[Message 44] Erin: Definitely! High demand.
[Message 45] Alex: Agreed. Hope she gets it.
[Message 46] Dale: She's really nervous. She's been practicing her interview skills all week.
[Message 47] Casey: That's good. Preparation is key.
[Message 48] Erin: Tell her to relax and be herself.
[Message 49] Alex: Exactly! Authenticity goes a long way.
[Message 50] Dale: I'll pass that on. Thanks again.
[Message 51] Casey: Back to gardening… Anyone fertilizing their tomatoes?
[Message 52] Erin: Yes, I use a tomato-specific fertilizer every couple of weeks.
[Message 53] Alex: I use a balanced fertilizer early on, then switch to one higher in phosphorus.
[Message 54] Dale: Fertilizer? Sounds complicated.
[Message 55] Casey: It's not too bad, Dale. Just follow the instructions on the package.
[Message 56] Erin: You can also use compost tea as a natural fertilizer.
[Message 57] Alex: Good point, Erin! Compost tea is great.
[Message 58] Casey: I've heard of that but never tried it.
[Message 59] Dale: Compost tea? Sounds like something I wouldn't want to drink!
[Message 60] Erin: Definitely don't drink it, Dale!
[Message 61] Alex: Haha! Definitely for the plants only.
[Message 62] Casey: I think I'll stick to the store-bought fertilizer for now.
[Message 63] Erin: Whatever works for you!
[Message 64] Alex: Anyone growing anything unusual this year?
[Message 65] Casey: I'm trying to grow artichokes. So far, no luck.
[Message 66] Dale: Artichokes? Fancy!
[Message 67] Erin: I'm growing purple carrots. They're fun.
[Message 68] Alex: Purple carrots! Cool. I'm trying dragon fruit.
[Message 69] Casey: Dragon fruit in Corpus Christi? That's ambitious!
[Message 70] Dale: Dragon fruit sounds delicious.
[Message 71] Erin: Good luck with the dragon fruit, Alex!
[Message 72] Alex: Thanks! I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
[Message 73] Casey: So, what time is everyone heading to their gardens this weekend?
[Message 74] Erin: Probably early morning before it gets too hot.
[Message 75] Alex: Same here. Sunrise is the best time.
[Message 76] Dale: I'll be sleeping in.
[Message 77] Casey: Haha! Fair enough, Dale.
[Message 78] Erin: Enjoy your sleep!
[Message 79] Alex: I'm hoping to get all my weeding done before the afternoon.
[Message 80] Casey: Weeding is the worst!
[Message 81] Erin: Tell me about it! It's a never-ending battle.
[Message 82] Alex: Truer words were never spoken.
[Message 83] Dale: I pay someone to do my weeding. Best investment ever.
[Message 84] Casey: I wish I could afford that!
[Message 85] Erin: One day!
[Message 86] Alex: Maybe someday for me too.
[Message 87] Casey: What are you all planning to have for dinner tonight?
[Message 88] Erin: Probably something simple. Maybe pasta.
[Message 89] Alex: I'm thinking grilled chicken.
[Message 90] Dale: Pizza!
[Message 91] Casey: Pizza sounds good too!
[Message 92] Erin: Pizza is always a good choice.
[Message 93] Alex: Can't go wrong with pizza.
[Message 94] Casey: Has anyone tried that new Italian place downtown?
[Message 95] Erin: I haven't. Is it good?
[Message 96] Alex: I heard it's pretty good. A little pricey, though.
[Message 97] Dale: I'll stick to my usual pizza place.
[Message 98] Casey: Fair enough!
[Message 99] Erin: Maybe I'll try it sometime.
[Message 100] Alex: Let us know what you think if you do.
[Message 101] Casey: Definitely!
[Message 102] Dale: Anyone watching the game tonight?
[Message 103] Erin: What game?
[Message 104] Alex: I think it's baseball.
[Message 105] Casey: I'm not a big sports fan.
[Message 106] Dale: It's the Astros.
[Message 107] Erin: Ah, okay.
[Message 108] Alex: I might catch a few innings.
[Message 109] Casey: I'll be watching a movie.
[Message 110] Dale: To each their own!
[Message 111] Erin: Sounds good!
[Message 112] Alex: Enjoy your movie, Casey.
[Message 113] Casey: Thanks! You too, if you watch the game, Alex.
[Message 114] Erin: I need to run. Happy gardening, everyone!
[Message 115] Alex: Bye, Erin!
[Message 116] Casey: Bye, Erin!
[Message 117] Dale: Later!
[Message 118] Alex: See ya!
[Message 119] Casey: Anyone else getting that itch to start planning for fall planting?
[Message 120] Alex: Already thinking about it! Time flies.
[Message 121] Dale: Fall planting? It's still summer!
[Message 122] Casey: I know, but it's good to be prepared.
[Message 123] Alex: What are you thinking of planting in the fall, Casey?
[Message 124] Casey: Probably some greens, like spinach and kale. And maybe some broccoli.
[Message 125] Dale: Broccoli? Sounds healthy.
[Message 126] Alex: I'm thinking of planting some garlic.
[Message 127] Casey: Garlic is a good idea!
[Message 128] Dale: I just buy garlic at the store.
[Message 129] Alex: Homegrown garlic is so much better, though.
[Message 130] Casey: Agreed!
[Message 131] Dale: Maybe I'll try it someday.
[Message 132] Alex: You should! It's easy.
[Message 133] Casey: Well, I should get going too. Have a great day, everyone!
[Message 134] Alex: You too, Casey!
[Message 135] Dale: Later!
[Message 136] Alex: Bye!
[Message 137] Alex: Dale, let me know how your granddaughter's interview went!
[Message 138] Dale: Will do, Alex! Thanks again for the well wishes.
[Message 139] Alex: No problem!
[Message 140] Dale: Say, you wouldn't happen to know anything about car maintenance, would you?
[Message 141] Alex: A little bit. What's up?
[Message 142] Dale: My car's making a funny noise.
[Message 143] Alex: What kind of noise?
[Message 144] Dale: Like a squealing sound.
[Message 145] Alex: Could be a belt. Or maybe your brakes.
[Message 146] Dale: I'll have to get it checked out.
[Message 147] Alex: Definitely. Don't want to risk it.
[Message 148] Dale: Thanks for the advice, Alex.
[Message 149] Alex: Anytime, Dale.
[Message 150] Alex: Well, I'm going to head out to the garden. Wish me luck with the weeding!
[Message 151] Dale: Good luck!
[Message 152] Alex: Thanks!
[Message 153] Dale: I think I'll go take a nap.
[Message 154] Alex: Enjoy your nap!
[Message 155] Dale: I will!
[Message 156] Alex: Talk to you later, Dale.
[Message 157] Dale: Sounds good.
[Message 158] Alex: Hopefully the squash bugs haven't invaded while I was chatting!
[Message 159] Dale: Those pesky bugs!
[Message 160] Alex: Seriously!
[Message 161] Dale: Maybe you should get some chickens.
[Message 162] Alex: Chickens? That's a thought!
[Message 163] Dale: They eat bugs.
[Message 164] Alex: True. But I don't know if I'm ready for chickens.
[Message 165] Dale: They're more work than they look.
[Message 166] Alex: I can imagine.
[Message 167] Dale: Plus, you have to deal with the eggs.
[Message 168] Alex: Eggs are good! But still...
[Message 169] Dale: Just a thought.
[Message 170] Alex: I appreciate it!
[Message 171] Dale: Well, enjoy your gardening!
[Message 172] Alex: Thanks, Dale!
[Message 173] Dale: I'm going to go find some shade.
[Message 174] Alex: Good idea. Stay cool!
[Message 175] Dale: You too!
[Message 176] Alex: Will do!
[Message 177] Dale: Talk to you later.
[Message 178] Alex: Later, Dale.
[Message 179] Dale: Let me know if you find any gold!
[Message 180] Alex: Haha! I'll be sure to let you know.
[Message 181] Dale: I'll split it with you.
[Message 182] Alex: Deal!
[Message 183] Dale: Alright then.
[Message 184] Alex: On my way to the garden.
[Message 185] Dale: Have fun!
[Message 186] Alex: Trying to stay cool.
[Message 187] Dale: Stay hydrated.
[Message 188] Alex: Always.
[Message 189] Dale: Okay, I'm signing off.

556,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone! Thinking about vacations. Anyone have any cool plans for this year?
[Message 2] Ben: I'd love to get away. Maybe somewhere tropical?
[Message 3] Casey: Tropical sounds amazing! I'm dreaming of beaches and sunshine.
[Message 4] Dana: Me too! Although, I'm also tempted by a city break.
[Message 5] Alex: A city break could be fun. I was thinking maybe a road trip across the country?
[Message 6] Ben: Road trip sounds epic! But a lot of driving, right?
[Message 7] Casey: Definitely a lot of driving! But the scenery would be incredible.
[Message 8] Dana: True. What about Europe? I’ve always wanted to go to Italy.
[Message 9] Alex: Italy is high on my list too! All that pasta...
[Message 10] Ben: And the art! I'd love to see the Vatican.
[Message 11] Casey: Okay, Italy is officially back on my radar.
[Message 12] Dana: We should all go together!
[Message 13] Alex: That would be amazing! Could be a bit hard to coordinate though.
[Message 14] Ben: Yeah, scheduling will be tricky. But worth a shot!
[Message 15] Casey: Let's at least explore some dates and see what works.
[Message 16] Dana: Sounds like a plan! What about you, Alex? Any specific places you want to hit on a road trip?
[Message 17] Alex: Route 66 has always appealed to me. Classic Americana.
[Message 18] Ben: Oh yeah! Diners and desert landscapes.
[Message 19] Casey: I'm in! That sounds like a fantastic experience.
[Message 20] Dana: Okay, Route 66 is a serious contender.
[Message 21] Alex: I need to give Maya some feedback on her presentation. Any tips?
[Message 22] Ben: Be specific with your feedback. Point out both strengths and areas for improvement.
[Message 23] Casey: Sandwich method! Positive, negative, positive.
[Message 24] Dana: Definitely. And focus on the presentation itself, not her as a person.
[Message 25] Alex: Good points, all! Thanks. Back to vacations... anyone been to Iceland?
[Message 26] Ben: I have! It's breathtaking. Waterfalls, glaciers, volcanoes...
[Message 27] Casey: Wow, that sounds incredible!
[Message 28] Dana: Iceland is definitely on my bucket list.
[Message 29] Alex: Okay, now I'm torn between Route 66 and Iceland.
[Message 30] Ben: Iceland is expensive though, just a heads up.
[Message 31] Casey: Good to know! Budget is definitely a factor.
[Message 32] Dana: Yeah, we need to be realistic about costs.
[Message 33] Alex: Maybe a shorter trip to Iceland then?
[Message 34] Ben: Could work. Or focus on specific areas rather than trying to see everything.
[Message 35] Casey: I'm happy to do some research on costs.
[Message 36] Dana: Awesome! I can look into flights.
[Message 37] Alex: You guys are the best!
[Message 38] Ben: Teamwork makes the dream work!
[Message 39] Casey: Absolutely! So, flights to Iceland, huh?
[Message 40] Dana: Yep! Let's see what we can find. What time of year are we thinking?
[Message 41] Alex: Summer for the warmer weather, maybe?
[Message 42] Ben: Summer is peak season, so expect higher prices.
[Message 43] Casey: Spring or fall might be a good compromise.
[Message 44] Dana: I'll check prices for both.
[Message 45] Alex: Perfect! This is exciting.
[Message 46] Ben: I know, I'm already looking forward to it.
[Message 47] Casey: Me too! Iceland here we come (hopefully!).
[Message 48] Dana: Okay, I'm seeing some decent prices for late September.
[Message 49] Alex: September could work!
[Message 50] Ben: Let me check my calendar.
[Message 51] Casey: Same here.
[Message 52] Dana: Great! I'll keep looking in the meantime.
[Message 53] Alex: So, how's everyone's week going so far?
[Message 54] Ben: Pretty busy, but good!
[Message 55] Casey: Same here. Just trying to keep up.
[Message 56] Dana: Mine's been hectic, but productive.
[Message 57] Alex: Glad to hear it! Back to vacation stuff, any preferences on activities in Iceland?
[Message 58] Ben: Blue Lagoon is a must!
[Message 59] Casey: Definitely! And the Northern Lights, if we're lucky.
[Message 60] Dana: Hiking is also a good option.
[Message 61] Alex: I'm up for all of that!
[Message 62] Ben: We should definitely rent a car and explore the island.
[Message 63] Casey: Agreed! That would give us more flexibility.
[Message 64] Dana: Okay, car rental is on the list.
[Message 65] Alex: This is all coming together nicely!
[Message 66] Ben: I'm starting to get really excited!
[Message 67] Casey: Me too! Can't wait to explore Iceland with you all.
[Message 68] Dana: It's going to be amazing!
[Message 69] Alex: I saw a cool documentary about Iceland's volcanoes the other day.
[Message 70] Ben: Oh, interesting! I'll have to check that out.
[Message 71] Casey: Me too! Always good to learn more about the destination.
[Message 72] Dana: Agreed! The more we know, the better.
[Message 73] Alex: I'm thinking we should start a shared document to keep track of ideas and expenses.
[Message 74] Ben: Great idea! That would be really helpful.
[Message 75] Casey: I can set that up.
[Message 76] Dana: Perfect! Thanks, Casey.
[Message 77] Alex: You're the best!
[Message 78] Ben: You're a lifesaver!
[Message 79] Casey: No problem! It's already done. I'll share the link in a bit.
[Message 80] Dana: Awesome! So, September, Iceland, Blue Lagoon, Northern Lights, hiking, car rental...
[Message 81] Alex: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 82] Ben: I'm so ready for this.
[Message 83] Casey: Me too!
[Message 84] Dana: This is going to be epic!
[Message 85] Alex: Anyone else thinking about vacation outfits yet?
[Message 86] Ben: Haha, not quite! But I will be soon.
[Message 87] Casey: I've already started browsing online stores.
[Message 88] Dana: Same! Gotta be prepared.
[Message 89] Alex: Layers are key for Iceland, I'm guessing.
[Message 90] Ben: Definitely! The weather can be unpredictable.
[Message 91] Casey: Good point! I'll pack accordingly.
[Message 92] Dana: Me too! Warm socks are a must.
[Message 93] Alex: Alright, shared document link is in the chat!
[Message 94] Ben: Got it! Thanks!
[Message 95] Casey: Awesome, thanks!
[Message 96] Dana: Perfect!
[Message 97] Alex: So, next step: everyone check their calendars and add potential dates to the doc?
[Message 98] Ben: On it!
[Message 99] Casey: Will do!
[Message 100] Dana: Already done!
[Message 101] Alex: Wow, you guys are efficient!
[Message 102] Ben: We're a well-oiled machine.
[Message 103] Casey: Absolutely!
[Message 104] Dana: Teamwork makes the dream work, remember?
[Message 105] Alex: Still need to figure out the Maya feedback…
[Message 106] Ben: Maybe ask her how she felt the presentation went first.
[Message 107] Casey: That's a good way to open the conversation.
[Message 108] Dana: Shows you're interested in her perspective.
[Message 109] Alex: Yeah, that's a good call. Thanks, guys!
[Message 110] Ben: No problem! Back to Iceland, I’m thinking thermal underwear is a must.
[Message 111] Casey: Great idea! I’ll add that to the packing list in the document.
[Message 112] Dana: Smart! I almost forgot about that.
[Message 113] Alex: I’m so glad we’re doing this. I needed a vacation!
[Message 114] Ben: Me too! It’s been a long year.
[Message 115] Casey: Definitely! This is going to be so refreshing.
[Message 116] Dana: I can already feel the stress melting away.
[Message 117] Alex: I think I’m leaning toward the thermal socks with the little sheep on them.
[Message 118] Ben: Haha! Perfect for Iceland.
[Message 119] Casey: Those sound adorable!
[Message 120] Dana: You have to get them!
[Message 121] Alex: I think I will! Okay, dates are in the doc.
[Message 122] Ben: Great! I’ll take a look now.
[Message 123] Casey: Me too!
[Message 124] Dana: Perfect! Let’s try to narrow down a date soon.
[Message 125] Alex: Agreed! I’m flexible within that window.
[Message 126] Ben: Same here.
[Message 127] Casey: Me three!
[Message 128] Dana: Alright, looks like the last week of September works best for everyone!
[Message 129] Alex: Woohoo!
[Message 130] Ben: Awesome!
[Message 131] Casey: Fantastic!
[Message 132] Dana: Okay, Iceland here we come!
[Message 133] Alex: I’m so excited! Thanks for planning this with me, everyone!
[Message 134] Ben: Of course! It’s going to be amazing.
[Message 135] Casey: We’re all in this together!
[Message 136] Dana: Absolutely! We’re a great team.
[Message 137] Alex: Now, back to those thermal socks…

[Message 2] Martha: Agnes! Evening to you too. Just finished my tea. Thinking of watching a movie later.

[Message 4] Martha: Not really. Open to suggestions. You always have good taste.
[Message 5] Agnes: That's kind of you to say! Hmm... Have you seen ""Singin' in the Rain"" recently?
[Message 6] Martha: A classic! I haven't in ages. That might be perfect.
[Message 7] Agnes: It always lifts my spirits. The dancing is just wonderful.
[Message 8] Martha: Agreed. Gene Kelly was something else. Speaking of, did you manage to get your presentation done?
[Message 9] Agnes: Almost! Just need to practice a few more times. I get so nervous!
[Message 10] Martha: You'll be brilliant, Agnes. You always are. Remember to breathe.
[Message 11] Agnes: Thank you, Martha. Your support means a lot.
[Message 12] Martha: Anytime. Now, back to movies. Anything new catch your eye lately? I saw an ad for a historical drama.
[Message 13] Agnes: Oh really? What's it called? I do enjoy a good historical drama.
[Message 14] Martha: I think it was ""The Crown's Jewel."" Sounded interesting. About a queen, naturally.
[Message 15] Agnes: Queen intrigues are always captivating. Maybe I'll look for that one.
[Message 16] Martha: Let me grab my tablet. I'll check the reviews for you.
[Message 17] Agnes: You're a dear, Martha. Technology is your forte, isn't it?
[Message 18] Martha: I try! It keeps me busy. Review says ""predictable plot, but beautiful costumes.""
[Message 19] Agnes: Hmm, beautiful costumes are tempting...
[Message 20] Martha: There's also ""Paddington 2."" Pure joy.
[Message 21] Agnes: Oh, I adored the first one! Paddington is so polite.
[Message 22] Martha: The sequel is just as charming. And Hugh Grant is surprisingly good in it.
[Message 23] Agnes: Hugh Grant? I haven't seen him in anything for years!
[Message 24] Martha: He's the villain! A washed-up actor. Quite funny.
[Message 25] Agnes: Now you've piqued my interest. Paddington 2 it is!
[Message 26] Martha: Excellent choice! Want me to put it on for you? I can stream it.
[Message 27] Agnes: Would you mind terribly? That would be so kind.
[Message 28] Martha: Not at all! Just give me a moment. Where are the remote and my reading glasses...?
[Message 29] Agnes: They're usually on the side table next to your chair, Martha.
[Message 30] Martha: Ah, found them! Thank you, Agnes. You always know where everything is.
[Message 31] Agnes: Years of practice, my dear. Years of practice.
[Message 32] Martha: Okay, ""Paddington 2"" loading... Did you hear Mrs. Henderson’s cat had kittens?
[Message 33] Agnes: Oh, no! How many? Are they all right?
[Message 34] Martha: I think she said four. All healthy as can be. She’s looking for homes for them, naturally.
[Message 35] Agnes: Oh, I wish I could take one! But I don't think I could manage it at my age.
[Message 36] Martha: I understand. They are a lot of work. Movie's almost on!
[Message 37] Agnes: Perfect timing!
[Message 38] Martha: Here we go... prepare for some marmalade sandwiches.
[Message 39] Agnes: (Chuckles) I might have to ask for some marmalade toast tomorrow morning.
[Message 40] Martha: A fine idea! I'll put in a request with the kitchen.
[Message 41] Agnes: You're the best, Martha. Thank you for everything.
[Message 42] Martha: My pleasure, Agnes. Enjoy the movie!
[Message 43] Agnes: I will! ...Oh, look, it's starting!
[Message 44] Martha: Isn't that set design lovely?
[Message 45] Agnes: Absolutely stunning. Very detailed.
[Message 46] Martha: I always appreciate the artistry in these kinds of films.
[Message 47] Agnes: Me too. It's a lost art, almost.
[Message 48] Martha: True. Things are so fast-paced these days.
[Message 49] Agnes: Remember when movie-making was a real spectacle?
[Message 50] Martha: I do. Going to the cinema was an event.
[Message 51] Agnes: Now it's all streaming and on-demand. Convenient, but less special.
[Message 52] Martha: A good point. Still, I'm grateful we can watch films like this so easily.
[Message 53] Agnes: Agreed. And thank you for sharing it with me.
[Message 54] Martha: Of course, Agnes. We should do this more often. Maybe next week we can watch ""Casablanca?""
[Message 55] Agnes: Oh, I haven't seen that in ages! A wonderful suggestion.
[Message 56] Martha: I'll mark it on the calendar. Just let me know when you're free after your presentation.
[Message 57] Agnes: Will do! I feel much better about it now, actually.
[Message 58] Martha: See? Movies are good for the soul.
[Message 59] Agnes: They truly are. A little escape from reality.
[Message 60] Martha: Exactly. And Paddington is about to get into some trouble, I bet.
[Message 61] Agnes: (Laughing) He always does! Such a good bear.
[Message 62] Martha: He reminds me of you, sometimes. Always trying to do the right thing.
[Message 63] Agnes: (Blushing) Oh, Martha, you're too kind!
[Message 64] Martha: It's true! Now, shush, the movie is getting to the good part.

558,"[Message 1] Sarah: Hey everyone! Anyone else still recovering from the parent-teacher meeting marathon last night?
[Message 2] Alex: Sarah, you read my mind! I'm running on fumes. Did anyone else's kid suddenly become a master artist...according to the teacher?
[Message 3] Jamie: Alex, that's hilarious! Mine suddenly developed a passion for...cleaning the classroom floor? Apparently.
[Message 4] River: Fumes, indeed. I think I aged ten years in two hours. The sugar rush from the PTA bake sale didn't help.
[Message 5] George: Tell me about it, River! I'm pretty sure I saw a kid try to trade a cupcake for a detention slip.
[Message 6] Sarah: George, that's amazing! My kid just wanted to know why I didn't bring extra snacks.
[Message 7] Alex: The pressure! Mine wanted to know why his artwork wasn't on the fridge *before* he even showed it to me.
[Message 8] Jamie: It's a tough life being a kid these days. All that artistic pressure!
[Message 9] River: So, anyone have any actual *useful* insights from the meetings? Besides the sudden art skills?
[Message 10] George: My kid's teacher suggested some extra reading at home. Specifically, graphic novels. I thought that was pretty cool.
[Message 11] Sarah: Graphic novels are a great idea, George! My kid loves them.
[Message 12] Alex: That's actually a good suggestion. We might try that.
[Message 13] Jamie: Speaking of reading, has anyone read that new fantasy book that came out last week?
[Message 14] River: Jamie, totally off-topic, but yes! I'm obsessed!
[Message 15] George: Back to the meetings... anyone else get the feeling they're just designed to make us feel guilty?
[Message 16] Sarah: George, a little bit, yeah. It's hard not to feel like you're failing.
[Message 17] Alex: I think it depends on the teacher. Some are really supportive and give constructive feedback.
[Message 18] Jamie: True, Alex. We had one who was all doom and gloom.
[Message 19] River: Maybe we should form a support group for parents after these meetings. ""Parents Anonymous""?
[Message 20] George: River, I'm in! We can commiserate over lukewarm coffee and stale cookies.
[Message 21] Sarah: And share embarrassing kid stories. I have a treasure trove.
[Message 22] Alex: Oh, me too. Like the time my kid tried to pay for groceries with Monopoly money...
[Message 23] Jamie: LOL! My kid tried to convince the mailman he was a superhero.
[Message 24] River: These are gold! Okay, officially adding ""share embarrassing kid stories"" to the agenda for Parents Anonymous.
[Message 25] George: I'll bring the lukewarm coffee. Someone else needs to handle the cookie situation.
[Message 26] Sarah: I can bake some cookies! Nothing stale, I promise.
[Message 27] Alex: You're a lifesaver, Sarah! I'm terrible at baking.
[Message 28] Jamie: My baking skills are limited to burning toast. I'll bring juice boxes.
[Message 29] River: Perfect! Team effort. Okay, back to the original question... any other takeaways from the meetings?
[Message 30] George: My kid's teacher mentioned a new science project coming up. Sounds intense.
[Message 31] Sarah: Ugh, science projects. My kid always leaves them until the last minute.
[Message 32] Alex: Same here! And then I'm up all night gluing things together.
[Message 33] Jamie: Sounds like a bonding experience...sort of.
[Message 34] River: More like a stress-inducing experience! But yeah, bonding, I guess.
[Message 35] George: Anyone else find it weird how they always ask for volunteers for everything?
[Message 36] Sarah: George, yes! The constant need for volunteers is overwhelming.
[Message 37] Alex: I think they're just desperate. They're probably understaffed and overworked.
[Message 38] Jamie: True. It's tough being a teacher.
[Message 39] River: Okay, maybe we should all volunteer for *one* thing this year. Just to do our part.
[Message 40] George: I'll volunteer to… donate money. Is that still volunteering?
[Message 41] Sarah: Haha, George, that counts!
[Message 42] Alex: I might be able to help with the school garden. I do some sculpting, I could make some cool plant markers.
[Message 43] Jamie: That's awesome, Alex!
[Message 44] River: See? Teamwork! I can help with the school library. I love organizing things.
[Message 45] George: Okay, we're actually being productive. This is terrifying.
[Message 46] Sarah: I can help with fundraising. I'm a financial analyst, after all.
[Message 47] Alex: Seriously, you guys are amazing. I feel like a slacker now.
[Message 48] Jamie: Don't worry, Alex! I'm still on juice box duty.
[Message 49] River: Exactly! Every role is important. Especially juice box procurement.
[Message 50] George: Alright, well, I'm feeling slightly less guilty now. Thanks, everyone.
[Message 51] Sarah: Me too! This was actually kind of helpful.
[Message 52] Alex: Definitely. Misery loves company, right?
[Message 53] Jamie: More like ""shared experiences create community."" Sounds better, doesn't it?
[Message 54] River: Much better, Jamie! You're hired as our official PR person.
[Message 55] George: Can we get that in writing? For my volunteer file?
[Message 56] Sarah: LOL! Of course, George. Officially documented.
[Message 57] Alex: Okay, I'm officially signing off to go stare blankly at my sculpting clay.
[Message 58] Jamie: Good luck with the plant markers, Alex!
[Message 59] River: And good luck with the science project avoidance, everyone else!

559,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone! Anyone thinking about travel plans for the fall?
[Message 2] Ben: Fall? Already? Summer just started! But yeah, I'm always thinking about travel.
[Message 3] Chris: I'd love to get away. Maybe somewhere warm.
[Message 4] David: Warm sounds good. I’m picturing a beach.
[Message 5] Emily: Beaches are nice, but I'm more of a city person.
[Message 6] Alex: I’m with you, Emily. I love exploring new cities.
[Message 7] Ben: Cities are too crowded for me. Give me the open road any day.
[Message 8] Chris: Road trips can be fun, but they can also be tiring.
[Message 9] David: True, but you see so much more.
[Message 10] Emily: Has anyone been to Lisbon? I was looking at some pictures and it looks amazing.
[Message 11] Alex: Lisbon is on my list! I’ve heard great things.
[Message 12] Ben: Lisbon? Isn't that in Portugal?
[Message 13] Chris: Yep! Heard the food is fantastic.
[Message 14] David: I've been to Portugal. Beautiful country!
[Message 15] Emily: What did you think, David?
[Message 16] David: Loved it. The people were friendly, the architecture was stunning.
[Message 17] Alex: Sold! Now I really want to go.
[Message 18] Ben: Sounds expensive.
[Message 19] Chris: Depends on how you do it, Ben.
[Message 20] David: There are ways to travel affordably.
[Message 21] Emily: Exactly! Hostels, budget airlines...
[Message 22] Alex: What about Italy? Has anyone been to Italy?
[Message 23] Ben: Italy is always a good choice. Rome, Florence...
[Message 24] Chris: I've only been to Venice. It was magical.
[Message 25] David: Venice is amazing, but incredibly touristy.
[Message 26] Emily: Yeah, I've heard that.
[Message 27] Alex: Maybe somewhere a little less crowded then.
[Message 28] Ben: Somewhere like... Ohio?
[Message 29] Chris: (Laughing) Not exactly what I had in mind, Ben.
[Message 30] David: Ben, you're incorrigible.
[Message 31] Emily: What about Croatia? I’ve seen some beautiful pictures of the coast.
[Message 32] Alex: Croatia is gorgeous!
[Message 33] Ben: Where's Croatia even?
[Message 34] Chris: Europe, Ben. Near Italy.
[Message 35] David: The Adriatic coast is stunning.
[Message 36] Emily: I’m thinking of going on a first date there.
[Message 37] Alex: Ooh, exciting!
[Message 38] Ben: A first date in Croatia? Bold move.
[Message 39] Chris: Very romantic, Emily!
[Message 40] David: Hope it goes well!
[Message 41] Emily: Thanks, everyone! I'm a little nervous.
[Message 42] Alex: Don’t be! Just be yourself.
[Message 43] Ben: Easier said than done.
[Message 44] Chris: True, but a little nervous energy can be good.
[Message 45] David: Just relax and enjoy the scenery.
[Message 46] Emily: I will try!
[Message 47] Alex: Back to travel... anyone ever backpacked through Southeast Asia?
[Message 48] Ben: Backpacking? Sounds like hard work.
[Message 49] Chris: I did it in my 20s. It was amazing.
[Message 50] David: I've heard incredible things.
[Message 51] Emily: I'd love to do that someday.
[Message 52] Alex: Me too! Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia...
[Message 53] Ben: Bugs. Lots of bugs.
[Message 54] Chris: There are bugs, yes. But the food! The culture!
[Message 55] David: The temples are breathtaking.
[Message 56] Emily: Definitely adding that to the list.
[Message 57] Alex: Has anyone been to Japan?
[Message 58] Ben: I hear the trains are always on time.
[Message 59] Chris: Japan is fascinating. So different from anything else.
[Message 60] David: The technology is incredible.
[Message 61] Emily: I’d love to see the cherry blossoms.
[Message 62] Alex: Me too! That's a dream of mine.
[Message 63] Ben: I’d just like to see a reliable train schedule.
[Message 64] Chris: (Laughing) You and your trains, Ben.
[Message 65] David: He's obsessed.
[Message 66] Emily: What about South America? Anyone been there?
[Message 67] Alex: I’ve always wanted to go to Machu Picchu.
[Message 68] Ben: Isn’t that really high up?
[Message 69] Chris: It is. Altitude sickness is a real thing.
[Message 70] David: But the views are worth it.
[Message 71] Emily: I’m not great with heights…
[Message 72] Alex: Me neither, but I'd still try it.
[Message 73] Ben: Maybe I’ll stick to ground level.
[Message 74] Chris: Fair enough.
[Message 75] David: What about the Galapagos Islands?
[Message 76] Emily: Oh, I’ve heard those are amazing!
[Message 77] Alex: So unique!
[Message 78] Ben: Are there a lot of tourists there?
[Message 79] Chris: They control the tourism pretty strictly, I think.
[Message 80] David: To protect the wildlife.
[Message 81] Emily: Good!
[Message 82] Alex: Okay, now I’m overwhelmed with options.
[Message 83] Ben: Story of my life.
[Message 84] Chris: Me too.
[Message 85] David: So many places to see, so little time.
[Message 86] Emily: We need to win the lottery.
[Message 87] Alex: That’s the plan!
[Message 88] Ben: Don’t get your hopes up.
[Message 89] Chris: Never hurts to dream, Ben.
[Message 90] David: Exactly.
[Message 91] Emily: Speaking of dreams, I had a weird dream last night about cats.
[Message 92] Alex: Haha, cats?
[Message 93] Ben: Cats are evil.
[Message 94] Chris: Oh, come on, Ben!
[Message 95] David: Ben’s not a cat person.
[Message 96] Emily: I guess not! Anyway, back to travel...
[Message 97] Alex: Anyone been to Iceland?
[Message 98] Ben: Isn’t it cold?
[Message 99] Chris: It is, but it's also incredibly beautiful.
[Message 100] David: The Northern Lights are a must-see.
[Message 101] Emily: I’ve always wanted to see those!
[Message 102] Alex: Me too! It’s on my bucket list.
[Message 103] Ben: Sounds like a good way to freeze to death.
[Message 104] Chris: You can wear layers, Ben!
[Message 105] David: And drink hot chocolate.
[Message 106] Emily: And soak in a geothermal spa!
[Message 107] Alex: Okay, Iceland is definitely climbing the list.
[Message 108] Ben: Make sure you pack warm socks.
[Message 109] Chris: Good advice, Ben.
[Message 110] David: Practical as always.
[Message 111] Emily: I will! Thanks!
[Message 112] Alex: So, who's actually planning a trip anytime soon?
[Message 113] Ben: Not me. I’m staying put.
[Message 114] Chris: I’m thinking about a weekend getaway to Austin.
[Message 115] David: I might visit my daughter in Colorado.
[Message 116] Emily: Still deciding on Croatia for that date.
[Message 117] Alex: I'm still in the dreaming phase.
[Message 118] Ben: Dreaming is free.
[Message 119] Chris: True!
[Message 120] David: Very true.
[Message 121] Emily: Well, it's been fun chatting about travel!
[Message 122] Alex: Yeah, it has!
[Message 123] Ben: See you all later.
[Message 124] Chris: Bye everyone!
[Message 125] David: Take care!
[Message 126] Emily: Bye!
[Message 127] Alex: Bye!
[Message 128] Alex: (A few minutes later) Anyone else still at the post office?
[Message 129] Chris: Still here. Long line!
[Message 130] Alex: Same! Thought I'd be in and out.
[Message 131] Chris: Nope!
[Message 132] Chris: Maybe we should have coordinated.
[Message 133] Alex: Right?! Next time!
[Message 134] David: I'm home now. Got out of there just in time.
[Message 135] Emily: Lucky you, David!
[Message 136] David: So, for real, Croatia is a great place for a first date.
[Message 137] Emily: Good to know you really mean it!
[Message 138] David: I do!
[Message 139] Alex: I have a friend who went there on their honeymoon.
[Message 140] Alex: Said it was magical.
[Message 141] Ben: Still doesn't sound worth it.
[Message 142] Chris: Ben!
[Message 143] Emily: We'll see!
[Message 144] Chris: Well, I gotta go!
[Message 145] Chris: My order is up at the bakery.
[Message 146] Alex: Ooh, what are you getting?
[Message 147] Chris: A croissant and a coffee!
[Message 148] Chris: Gotta get my energy up.
[Message 149] Alex: Sounds good! Enjoy!
[Message 150] Chris: Thanks!
[Message 151] David: Enjoy!
[Message 152] Emily: Have a good one!
[Message 153] Ben: Whatever.
[Message 154] Alex: (Laughing) Bye Ben!
[Message 155] David: Bye Ben!
[Message 156] Emily: See ya Ben!
[Message 157] Alex: Okay, finally leaving the post office!
[Message 158] Alex: What a morning!
[Message 159] David: Glad you made it through!
[Message 160] Emily: Yeah, that's rough.
[Message 161] Alex: Tell me about it!
[Message 162] Alex: Alright, well, I'm off to run more errands!
[Message 163] David: Good luck with those!
[Message 164] Emily: Have a good day, Alex!
[Message 165] Alex: You too!
[Message 166] David: I'm gonna go do some writing now.
[Message 167] Emily: Nice!
[Message 168] Emily: What are you working on?
[Message 169] David: Just a short story. Nothing too serious.

[Message 2] Kai: Yeah, crazy. Some guy, right? Pushed. What's happening with that new client proposal?
[Message 3] Liam: Yeah, 7.  Activist. Wild. Proposal's almost done. Just need Sarah's input.
[Message 4] Kai: 7.  Activist, huh? I knew the manager there. He was a piece of work. Sarah's always slow, ugh.
[Message 5] Liam: What do you mean about the manager?
[Message 6] Kai: Just, you know, difficult. Demanding. Nothing important. Did you hear anything about who did it?
[Message 7] Liam: Rumor mill's going crazy. Something about a disagreement. Heard it was business related.
[Message 8] Kai: Business? Huh. Sounds boring. I’m at the gym. You going later?
[Message 9] Liam: Maybe. Still processing this whole thing. So sad.
[Message 10] Kai: True. Bad for business for the Ice Cream Shop, too, lol. Okay, gotta run.
[Message 11] Liam: Catch you later.
[Message 12] Chloe: Liam, you online?
[Message 13] Liam: Hey Chloe, what's up?
[Message 14] Chloe: Heard about 7.  Activist. Awful! Poor guy.
[Message 15] Liam: Yeah, shocking. Right in broad daylight.
[Message 16] Chloe: I was there earlier that day! Like, maybe an hour before?
[Message 17] Liam: Seriously? Did you see anything suspicious?
[Message 18] Chloe: No, just the usual. Maybe… I saw Alex leaving the building, but that’s not unusual, right?
[Message 19] Liam: Alex? From accounting? He works near the Ice Cream Shop?
[Message 20] Chloe: Yeah, he always gets ice cream from there. Actus Reus, I suppose - Alex was there.
[Message 21] Liam: Hmmm. Weird.
[Message 22] Chloe: Why weird?
[Message 23] Liam: Just… he mentioned he hated 7.  Activist once. Said he was always causing trouble. Mens Rea, maybe?
[Message 24] Chloe: Oh, wow. I didn’t know that. Okay, now *I'm* freaked out.
[Message 25] Liam: Don't be. Could be nothing.
[Message 26] Chloe: I gotta go, I'm getting nervous now.
[Message 27] Liam: Okay, talk soon.
[Message 28] Kai: Yo, Liam, you still up?
[Message 29] Liam: Yeah, what’s up?
[Message 30] Kai: You won't believe what I just heard.
[Message 31] Liam: What?
[Message 32] Kai: They found video footage.
[Message 33] Liam: Of what?
[Message 34] Kai: Apparently shows someone on the roof of the Ice Cream Shop. Vague, but still.
[Message 35] Liam: Woah. That's crazy. Did they identify anyone?
[Message 36] Kai: Not yet. Just a silhouette.
[Message 37] Liam: That's intense. Concurrence! Connecting intent and action. Scary stuff.
[Message 38] Kai: Yeah, for real. Anyway, wanted to let you know. Night.
[Message 39] Liam: Thanks. Night.
[Message 40] Chloe: Liam! You won't believe what I just remembered.
[Message 41] Liam: What now? My heart can't take much more of this.
[Message 42] Chloe: Alex was looking up Pushing from a height online last week! I saw his search history on his computer screen when he left for lunch. Attempt?
[Message 43] Liam: No way! Are you serious?
[Message 44] Chloe: Dead serious. I thought it was weird at the time, but I didn't think anything of it!
[Message 45] Liam: Okay, this is getting way too suspicious. I think we should tell the police.
[Message 46] Chloe: Are you sure? I don't want to get involved.
[Message 47] Liam: We have to. This is too much to ignore.
[Message 48] Chloe: Okay, okay. Let's go together.
[Message 49] Liam: Good. Meet me in an hour?
[Message 50] Chloe: Deal. I’m scared, Liam.
[Message 51] Liam: Me too.
[Message 52] Kai: Liam, you up for a game tonight?
[Message 53] Liam: Can’t. Something came up.
[Message 54] Kai: Oh, okay. All good. You seemed stressed earlier. Everything alright?
[Message 55] Liam: Yeah, just…stuff.
[Message 56] Kai: Wanna talk about it? I’m a good listener.
[Message 57] Liam: Thanks, but I’m good. Just need to deal with it.
[Message 58] Kai: Alright. Whatever you need. Later.
[Message 59] Liam: Later.
[Message 60] Alex: Hey Liam, you seen Sarah today?
[Message 61] Liam: No, not since yesterday. Why?
[Message 62] Alex: Just need those reports. You know how she is.
[Message 63] Liam: Yeah, I know. I'll let her know you're looking for her.
[Message 64] Alex: Thanks, appreciate it.
[Message 65] Liam: No problem.
[Message 66] Chloe: They’re going away for a long time for this, right? Punishment for harming 7.  Activist.
[Message 67] Liam: That’s what the police were saying. Depending on everything.
[Message 68] Chloe: I feel terrible. I should have said something sooner about Alex.
[Message 69] Liam: Don’t beat yourself up. You didn't know.
[Message 70] Chloe: I keep thinking, what if I had stopped him?
[Message 71] Liam: You couldn’t have known what he intended.
[Message 72] Chloe: I hope I did the right thing.
[Message 73] Liam: You did.
[Message 74] Kai: Liam, you free now? Games?
[Message 75] Liam: Nah, still busy. Sorry.
[Message 76] Kai: You’ve been busy all day. Everything okay? You're acting weird.
[Message 77] Liam: Just… a lot on my mind.
[Message 78] Kai: Okay… Well, if you need anything, let me know. I'm here for you.
[Message 79] Liam: Thanks, Kai.
[Message 80] Alex: Liam, the police just came by my desk and asked me a lot of questions! About the Ice Cream Shop!
[Message 81] Liam: Yeah, they're interviewing everyone who works nearby.
[Message 82] Alex: But they were asking about 7.  Activist, and if I knew him! I barely knew him!
[Message 83] Liam: Just tell them the truth, Alex. You'll be fine.
[Message 84] Alex: But what if they don't believe me? I don't want to get involved in this!
[Message 85] Liam: Just cooperate with them, and you won't have any problems.
[Message 86] Alex: Easy for you to say!
[Message 87] Liam: I’m just saying, don't panic.
[Message 88] Chloe: Liam, did you hear about Alex?
[Message 89] Liam: Yeah, he texted me. Sounds freaked out.
[Message 90] Chloe: I heard he hired a lawyer.
[Message 91] Liam: Seriously? That’s not good.
[Message 92] Chloe: I know, right? Makes him look even more guilty.
[Message 93] Liam: Maybe he’s just scared.
[Message 94] Chloe: Maybe…
[Message 95] Kai: Dude, this Alex thing is wild. You think he did it?
[Message 96] Liam: I don't know what to think.
[Message 97] Kai: I mean, you said he hated 7.  Activist.
[Message 98] Liam: Yeah, but hating someone doesn't make you a murderer.
[Message 99] Kai: True, true. Still, looks bad for him.
[Message 100] Liam: It does.
[Message 101] Alex: Liam, can I talk to you? In person?
[Message 102] Liam: Sure, meet me at the coffee shop in an hour?
[Message 103] Alex: Thanks, I really appreciate it.
[Message 104] Liam: See you then.
[Message 105] Chloe: Be careful, Liam.
[Message 106] Liam: I will.
[Message 107] Chloe: What if he tries to… I don’t even want to think about it.
[Message 108] Liam: He won’t. I'll be fine.
[Message 109] Chloe: Okay… Just please be careful.
[Message 110] Liam: Always.
[Message 111] Kai: Liam, you’re meeting with Alex? Seriously?
[Message 112] Liam: He asked to talk. What am I supposed to do? Say no?
[Message 113] Kai: I don’t know, man. Seems risky. Maybe I should come with you?
[Message 114] Liam: I appreciate it, but I think I need to do this alone.
[Message 115] Kai: Just… be careful, okay? Something about this whole situation feels off.
[Message 116] Liam: It does. I will.
[Message 117] Kai: Let me know how it goes. I'll be waiting to hear from you.
[Message 118] Liam: Will do.

563,"[Message 1] CHLOE: Heard about what happened at the Swimming Pool? So messed up.

[Message 2] MARK: Yeah, crazy. Two 8.  Judge dead. What the hell is going on?

[Message 3] ANNA: I know, right? Both were horrible incident. Poor Judges, rest in peace.

[Message 4] DAVID: Anna, you worked at the court, didn’t you? Did you know them?

[Message 5] ANNA: Yeah, I did. Knew Judges. This is awful.

[Message 6] CHLOE: I feel bad for the families. This is a tragedy.

[Message 7] MARK: Did they catch anyone yet?

[Message 8] DAVID: Not that I’ve heard. Police are being tight-lipped.

[Message 9] CHLOE: I was actually at the Swimming Pool yesterday afternoon. So scary to think about now.

[Message 10] ANNA: Seriously, Chloe? You were there?

[Message 11] CHLOE: Yeah, just grabbing some sun. Left around 5 PM.

[Message 12] DAVID: Early Evening, huh? Close to when it happened.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Don’t even, David. I had nothing to do with it.

[Message 14] DAVID: Just saying, it's bad timing for you.

[Message 15] ANNA: David, stop it. Chloe is a friend.

[Message 16] MARK: Relax, guys. Let the police do their job.

[Message 17] JAKE: Heard they found an Stabbing with an ice pick at the scene. Brutal.

[Message 18] ANNA: Stabbing with an ice pick? That's insane.

[Message 19] CHLOE: Where did you hear that, Jake?

[Message 20] JAKE: Just rumors, Chloe. Around.

[Message 21] DAVID: You always have the inside scoop, Jake.

[Message 22] JAKE: I just listen, David.

[Message 23] MARK: Anyone know the Judges?

[Message 24] ANNA: I worked with them, remember? One of them, Jessica, the woman, she was…intense. A bit Cynical.

[Message 25] CHLOE: I saw Jessica the manager arguing with someone near the pool last week. Sounded heated.

[Message 26] DAVID: Who was she arguing with, Chloe?

[Message 27] CHLOE: Couldn’t tell. Back was to me.

[Message 28] JAKE: Maybe that’s our guy. Someone she pissed off.

[Message 29] ANNA: Jessica could be difficult. But to kill her?

[Message 30] MARK: People do crazy things, Anna.

[Message 31] DAVID: Mark's right. Especially when money is involved.

[Message 32] CHLOE: Money? What money?

[Message 33] DAVID: Just saying, 8.  Judges often have estates and stuff.

[Message 34] ANNA: One of the Judges, let's call her Alexis, was always so Anxious. I wonder if she had enemies.

[Message 35] JAKE: Maybe Alexis knew something she shouldn't have.

[Message 36] CHLOE: You guys are spiraling.

[Message 37] MARK: We're just trying to make sense of it, Chloe.

[Message 38] DAVID: Yeah, Chloe. Why are you so defensive?

[Message 39] CHLOE: I’m not! This is just… a lot.

[Message 40] ANNA: Guys, let's not turn on each other. We're all upset.

[Message 41] JAKE: Agreed. It's messed up.

[Message 42] MARK: I heard Jessica the manager was about to make a big decision on a case. Political, maybe?

[Message 43] CHLOE: You think it was a political assassination?

[Message 44] MARK: Could be. Someone wanting to silence her.

[Message 45] DAVID: That would make sense, actually. The political motive is a good theory.

[Message 46] ANNA: I guess it is possible, I just thought of it as a regular homicide.

[Message 47] JAKE: If it's political, they're going away for a long time for this.

[Message 48] CHLOE: Hope they don't get the death penalty, I couldn't live with that.

[Message 49] MARK: Anyone seen Liam around?

[Message 50] ANNA: Liam? Why Liam?

[Message 51] MARK: Just haven't heard from him. He knew the Judges.

[Message 52] DAVID: Liam is always off the grid. Don't worry about it.

[Message 53] CHLOE: Yeah, Liam’s fine. Probably just busy.

[Message 54] JAKE: Liam always hated 8.  Judge, but I don't think he's capable of this.

[Message 55] ANNA: I agree. He's more talk than action.

[Message 56] MARK: True. But still.

[Message 57] DAVID: Let's focus on facts, not speculation.

[Message 58] CHLOE: Good idea, David.

[Message 59] ANNA: What facts do we have? Two dead 8.  Judges, Stabbing with an ice pick. Swimming Pool. Early Evening.

[Message 60] JAKE: And a lot of rumors.

[Message 61] MARK: And someone with a motive. Political or financial.

[Message 62] DAVID: Or both.

[Message 63] CHLOE: Let’s not forget, someone probably saw something. A witness.

[Message 64] ANNA: Hopefully, they'll come forward.

[Message 65] JAKE: You guys watching the game tonight? Distract ourselves from all this doom and gloom.

[Message 66] CHLOE: Maybe. Depends on my mood.

[Message 67] MARK: I'm in. Need a break.

[Message 68] DAVID: Me too.

[Message 69] ANNA: I'll pass. Still processing.

[Message 70] JAKE: Fair enough.

[Message 71] CHLOE: Anyone know if the Swimming Pool is closed? Was planning on going swimming tomorrow.

[Message 72] MARK: Probably closed for investigation, Chloe.

[Message 73] DAVID: Seriously? That’s your concern right now?

[Message 74] CHLOE: What? I’m just asking a question. I wasn’t even at the Swimming Pool when the murder happened.

[Message 75] ANNA: David, give her a break. It was a genuine question.

[Message 76] JAKE: Everyone just needs to chill. Too much tension here.

[Message 77] MARK: Agreed.

[Message 78] DAVID: Fine. But Chloe, be more sensitive, okay?

[Message 79] CHLOE: Okay. Sorry, everyone.

[Message 80] ANNA: It's alright, Chloe. We all say things we don't mean when we're stressed.

[Message 81] JAKE: Anyone got any snacks for the game later?

[Message 82] CHLOE: I can bring some chips.

[Message 83] MARK: I'll handle the drinks.

[Message 84] DAVID: I'll grab some pizza.

[Message 85] ANNA: Sounds like a plan, guys. Have fun.

[Message 86] JAKE: Will do.

[Message 87] CHLOE: Back to the murder… did anyone notice anything strange leading up to it?

[Message 88] MARK: Besides two dead 8.  Judges?

[Message 89] DAVID: Chloe's trying, Mark. Lay off.

[Message 90] ANNA: I did notice Jessica getting a lot of weird calls lately. She seemed stressed.

[Message 91] JAKE: Weird calls? Anything specific?

[Message 92] ANNA: No idea. She'd just say ""I can't talk now"" and hang up.

[Message 93] CHLOE: Maybe the calls were related to the political thing?

[Message 94] MARK: Could be. Someone trying to intimidate her.

[Message 95] DAVID: Intimidation that escalated.

[Message 96] ANNA: The other Judge, Alexis, seemed to know something, too. Like she was hiding something.

[Message 97] JAKE: Hiding something? What makes you say that?

[Message 98] ANNA: Just a feeling. She was acting strange the past few weeks.

[Message 99] CHLOE: Maybe they were both involved in something shady.

[Message 100] MARK: And someone wanted them silenced.

[Message 101] DAVID: It all adds up, doesn't it?

[Message 102] ANNA: It's terrifying to think about.

[Message 103] JAKE: Speaking of silenced... I heard Liam had a really bad argument with Alexis the 8.  Judge a week before the murder.

[Message 104] CHLOE: See? Liam!

[Message 105] MARK: What was the argument about, Jake?

[Message 106] DAVID: Yeah, details!

[Message 107] JAKE: I overheard them at a bar. Something about money and a deal gone wrong.

[Message 108] ANNA: Money? See, I knew Alexis was up to something.

[Message 109] CHLOE: Liam was looking up how to make Stabbing with an ice pick online. I saw him.

[Message 110] MARK: Chloe, what? Why didn’t you say something earlier?

[Message 111] DAVID: Chloe, you need to tell the police.

[Message 112] ANNA: This is huge!

[Message 113] JAKE: Damn, Chloe. You were holding out on us.

[Message 114] CHLOE: I was scared! And I didn't want to jump to conclusions.

[Message 115] MARK: Well, now you have. Call the cops.

[Message 116] DAVID: Now, Chloe!

[Message 117] ANNA: The concurrence of the event, the weapon and the suspect are all falling in place.

[Message 118] JAKE: Well, I guess we solved the case.

[Message 119] CHLOE: I'm calling them now.

[Message 120] MARK: Good. This needs to be over.

[Message 121] DAVID: Finally, some justice.

[Message 122] ANNA: I still can't believe it.

[Message 123] JAKE: It's crazy, Anna. Crazy world.

[Message 124] CHLOE: The police are on their way to Liam’s place.

[Message 125] MARK: Good. Let's hope they find something.

[Message 126] DAVID: I’m sure they will.

[Message 127] ANNA: I wonder what Alexis knew that got her killed.

[Message 128] JAKE: Maybe we'll never know.

[Message 129] CHLOE: Hopefully, this brings some closure to everyone.

[Message 130] MARK: Yeah, closure is needed.

[Message 131] DAVID: Agreed.

[Message 132] ANNA: I’m glad we could all talk about this. It helped.

[Message 133] JAKE: Me too.

[Message 134] CHLOE: We're all in this together.

[Message 105] Ben: It's too late for that, isn't it?

[Message 106] Chris: (Silence)

[Message 107] Amy: We have to think this through.

[Message 108] Ben: We do.

[Message 109] Chris: Maybe… maybe a clean slate. Start fresh.

[Message 110] Amy: What does that even mean?

[Message 111] Ben: He's not making any sense.

[Message 112] Chris: A chance. That's all.

[Message 113] Amy: A chance for what, Chris?

[Message 114] Chris: To… to make things right.

[Message 115] Ben: You can't unsee something like that.

[Message 116] Amy: No, you really can't.

[Message 117] Chris: Maybe... maybe *they* will understand.

[Message 118] Ben: Who, Chris? Who will understand?

[Message 119] Chris: (Mumbles) The… the people.

[Message 120] Amy: People? What people?

[Message 121] Ben: He’s not thinking straight.

[Message 122] Chris: Just… let's just finish the game.

[Message 123] Amy: Are you sure?

[Message 124] Ben: Chris…

[Message 125] Chris: Yeah. Let's just bowl. Forget everything. Like it never... happened.

[Message 126] Amy: (Sighs) Okay.

[Message 127] Ben: Fine. My turn.

567,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone, just thinking about family traditions. What's one tradition you cherish?
[Message 2] Jamie: Hmm, for me it's definitely our annual family camping trip. So many memories!
[Message 3] Chris: Camping, huh? I'm more of a stay-inside guy. For us, it's definitely the big Christmas Eve dinner.
[Message 4] Alex: Christmas Eve dinner sounds amazing. We always have a huge potluck on Thanksgiving.
[Message 5] Jamie: Potluck! Love those. So much variety.
[Message 6] Chris: Variety is the spice of life! Speaking of spice, I tried a new seasoning blend last night, pretty good.
[Message 7] Alex: Nice! What kind of seasoning? I'm always looking for new ideas.
[Message 8] Jamie: Ooh, me too! Tell us more, Chris!
[Message 9] Chris: It was a Moroccan blend. Had a nice kick to it. Found it at the farmer's market.
[Message 10] Alex: Farmer's market is the best. Okay, back to traditions - anyone else have one to share?
[Message 11] Jamie: We also have ""Movie Night Mondays."" Pretty self-explanatory.
[Message 12] Chris: Movie Night Mondays! That's cute. We try to do a board game night once a month.
[Message 13] Alex: Board games are always a good time. What's your favorite?
[Message 14] Jamie: Ooh, tough one. Probably Settlers of Catan.
[Message 15] Chris: Catan is classic. I'm a big fan of Ticket to Ride.
[Message 16] Alex: Ticket to Ride is great. Okay, I'm officially craving board game night now.
[Message 17] Jamie: Haha, me too! We should plan one sometime.
[Message 18] Chris: I'm in! How about next weekend?
[Message 19] Alex: Next weekend sounds good. Let's check our schedules.
[Message 20] Jamie: Will do! Hey, Alex, how's your mom doing? I know she wasn't feeling well last week.
[Message 21] Alex: She's doing much better, thanks for asking! Just a little under the weather.
[Message 22] Chris: Glad to hear it! Health is the most important thing.
[Message 23] Jamie: Absolutely. Sending her good vibes.
[Message 24] Alex: I appreciate that. She'll be happy to hear it.
[Message 25] Chris: So, board game night... are we thinking Saturday or Sunday?
[Message 26] Jamie: Saturday works for me. How about you, Alex?
[Message 27] Alex: Saturday works! Let's tentatively say Saturday evening?
[Message 28] Chris: Saturday evening it is! I can bring snacks.
[Message 29] Jamie: Awesome! I'll bring drinks.
[Message 30] Alex: I can bring...a winning attitude!
[Message 31] Jamie: Haha, we'll see about that!
[Message 32] Chris: May the best player win!
[Message 33] Alex: Speaking of winning, anyone watching the game tonight?
[Message 34] Jamie: Not really a sports person myself, sorry!
[Message 35] Chris: I might catch a bit of it. Depends on if I can stay awake.
[Message 36] Alex: Fair enough. Well, enjoy the game if you watch it!
[Message 37] Jamie: Thanks! So, Saturday, what time are we thinking?
[Message 38] Chris: How about 7pm?
[Message 39] Alex: 7pm works great.
[Message 40] Jamie: Perfect! 7pm it is.
[Message 41] Chris: Awesome. Looking forward to it!
[Message 42] Alex: Me too! Should be a fun night.
[Message 43] Jamie: Definitely. Okay, I gotta run, but I'll talk to you both later!
[Message 44] Chris: Sounds good! See ya, Jamie!
[Message 45] Alex: Bye, Jamie!
[Message 46] Chris: So, Alex, anything else going on this week?
[Message 47] Alex: Just the usual. Work, trying to get some exercise in, you know.
[Message 48] Chris: Same here. Trying to be more active.
[Message 49] Alex: It's tough, especially with the weather lately.
[Message 50] Chris: Tell me about it! It's been so unpredictable.
[Message 51] Alex: Yeah, one day it's sunny and warm, the next it's freezing.
[Message 52] Chris: Exactly! Gotta love Lubbock weather.
[Message 53] Alex: Haha, you're right. Wouldn't trade it though.
[Message 54] Chris: Me neither. It's home.
[Message 55] Alex: Absolutely. So, how's the family?
[Message 56] Chris: Everyone's doing well, thanks for asking. Kids are keeping me busy with school and activities.
[Message 57] Alex: I bet! They grow up so fast.
[Message 58] Chris: They really do. Makes you appreciate every moment.
[Message 59] Alex: It does. It really does.
[Message 60] Chris: You seen your grandkids lately?
[Message 61] Alex: Saw them last weekend. They're getting so big!
[Message 62] Chris: That's great. Always good to spend time with family.
[Message 63] Alex: Always. It's what matters most.
[Message 64] Chris: Agreed. Family and good health. Can't ask for much more.
[Message 65] Alex: Exactly.
[Message 66] Chris: Well, I should probably get back to work.
[Message 67] Alex: Sounds good. Talk to you later!
[Message 68] Chris: Later, Alex!
[Message 69] Alex: (later that day) Hey Jamie and Chris, something came up and I won't be able to make it to board game night on Saturday. Sorry!
[Message 70] Jamie: Oh no! Sorry to hear that, Alex. Everything okay?
[Message 71] Chris: Aww, that's too bad, Alex. Hope everything's alright.
[Message 72] Alex: Yeah, everything's fine, just a family thing I need to take care of.
[Message 73] Jamie: Okay, good. Well, we'll miss you!
[Message 74] Chris: Yeah, we'll have to reschedule soon.
[Message 75] Alex: Definitely. Raincheck for sure.
[Message 76] Jamie: So, Chris, still up for board games Saturday?
[Message 77] Chris: Yeah, I'm still in! Just won't be the same without Alex.
[Message 78] Jamie: Agreed. We'll have to dedicate a game to them.
[Message 79] Chris: Haha, good idea! Maybe Catan, since they mentioned it?
[Message 80] Jamie: Perfect! Catan in honor of Alex.
[Message 81] Chris: So, 7pm still work?
[Message 82] Jamie: Yep, still works for me.
[Message 83] Chris: Awesome. See you then!
[Message 84] Jamie: See ya, Chris!
[Message 85] Alex: Thanks, guys! Appreciate it.
[Message 86] Chris: No problem, Alex. Family first!
[Message 87] Jamie: Exactly! Take care.
[Message 88] Alex: You too!
[Message 89] Jamie: (Saturday evening) Hey Chris, I'm heading over now!
[Message 90] Chris: Sounds good! I'm all set up and ready to go.
[Message 91] Jamie: Awesome! See you in a bit.
[Message 92] Chris: See ya!
[Message 93] Jamie: (later that night) Thanks for the fun night, Chris!
[Message 94] Chris: You too, Jamie! Always a good time.
[Message 95] Jamie: Definitely! We should do it again soon.
[Message 96] Chris: Absolutely! And hopefully Alex can join us next time.
[Message 97] Jamie: Fingers crossed! Goodnight!
[Message 98] Chris: Goodnight, Jamie!
[Message 99] Alex: (Sunday morning) Hey guys, how was board game night?
[Message 100] Jamie: It was fun! We missed you though.
[Message 101] Chris: Yeah, it wasn't the same without you.
[Message 102] Alex: I figured. Glad you guys had a good time though!
[Message 103] Jamie: We dedicated a game of Catan to you.
[Message 104] Alex: Haha, that's awesome! I'm honored.
[Message 105] Chris: You earned it. Hope everything went well with your family thing.
[Message 106] Alex: It did, thanks for asking. Everything's back to normal now.
[Message 107] Jamie: Glad to hear it!
[Message 108] Chris: Me too!
[Message 109] Alex: So, when's the next board game night?
[Message 110] Jamie: Let's try for next weekend?
[Message 111] Chris: I'm good with that.
[Message 112] Alex: Me too! Let's solidify plans later in the week.
[Message 113] Jamie: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 114] Chris: Perfect!
[Message 115] Alex: Alright, well, I gotta run, but talk to you guys later!
[Message 116] Jamie: Bye, Alex!
[Message 117] Chris: Later, Alex!
[Message 118] Jamie: Hey Chris, did you ever find that new screwdriver you were looking for?
[Message 119] Chris: You know, I actually did! Found it at a garage sale yesterday.
[Message 120] Jamie: Nice! Score!
[Message 121] Chris: Tell me about it! It was a steal.
[Message 122] Jamie: I love a good garage sale find.

[Message 125] Chris: Sounds good! Talk to you later, Jamie!
[Message 126] Chris: (A few days later) Hey Alex and Jamie, how's everyone doing? Just checking in.
[Message 127] Jamie: Hey Chris! I'm doing alright, just trying to survive the week.
[Message 128] Alex: Doing well, thanks for asking. Looking forward to the weekend.
[Message 129] Chris: Me too! Any thoughts on what we should play next weekend?
[Message 130] Jamie: Ooh, good question! Maybe something new?
[Message 131] Alex: I'm open to suggestions!
[Message 132] Chris: I was thinking maybe Ticket to Ride? We didn't get to play it last time.
[Message 133] Jamie: Ticket to Ride sounds good to me!

[Message 8] River: ""I finally saw that new sci-fi one, 'Cosmic Drift'. Pretty good visuals.""
[Message 9] Jamie: ""Oh, I've heard mixed reviews about that one. Too slow, they said.""
[Message 10] River: ""Yeah, it's not action-packed, but the atmosphere is great.""
[Message 11] Sam: ""Sci-fi isn't really my thing. More of a documentary guy.""
[Message 12] Alex: ""Fair enough. Anyone seen 'The Last Lighthouse Keeper'?""
[Message 13] Jamie: ""That historical drama? No, but I saw the trailer. Looks interesting.""
[Message 14] River: ""I thought it was a bit predictable, honestly.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Ah, that's a shame. I was hoping for something different.""
[Message 16] Sam: ""Speaking of different, did anyone catch that meteor shower last night?""

[Message 34] Alex: ""There's that new action movie, 'Steel Fury', coming out next week. Might check that out.""
[Message 35] River: ""I saw the trailer for that. Looks a bit generic.""
[Message 36] Alex: ""Yeah, probably is, but sometimes you just need a mindless action flick.""

[Message 65] Alex: ""I think I'll skip it then. My attention span isn't what it used to be.""

[Message 82] Jamie: ""Haha, fair enough.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Anyone have a doctor's appointment coming up? Just curious.""

[Message 129] Jamie: ""Me too. It'll be a nice break from reality.""
[Message 130] Alex: ""Definitely. Sometimes you just need to switch off and relax.""

[Message 138] Alex: ""Well, that was a nice chat. Time to get back to work.""
[Message 139] Alex: ""Wonder what Sam's doing on that hike.""
[Message 140] Alex: ""Probably taking some amazing photos. He's a great photographer.""
[Message 141] Alex: ""I should ask him to teach me some tips sometime.""
[Message 142] Alex: ""Maybe after the movie night. If he's free, that is.""

569,"[Message 1] CHLOE: OMG, did you guys hear about what happened at the library this morning? 😭
[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, it's all over the news. Some accident?
[Message 3] ANNA: Sunrise, right? Crazy.
[Message 4] DAVID: Yeah, I saw the reports. Tragic. Anyone know who it was?
[Message 5] CHLOE: They said it was Alex. 😔
[Message 6] LIAM: Alex? The bartender? No way!
[Message 7] ANNA: Poor Alex. So young.
[Message 8] DAVID: I can't believe it.
[Message 9] CHLOE: I know, right? He was always so nice.
[Message 10] LIAM: I served him once; always smiling. This is messed up.
[Message 11] ANNA: This is awful.
[Message 12] DAVID: Did they say how it happened?
[Message 13] CHLOE: Accident, that's all they're saying.
[Message 14] LIAM: Makes you think, doesn't it?
[Message 15] ANNA: Definitely. Be safe out there.
[Message 16] DAVID: Agreed.
[Message 17] CHLOE: You too.
[Message 18] LIAM: Hey, Anna, did you finish that book I lent you?
[Message 19] ANNA: Almost! Should be done by tomorrow.
[Message 20] LIAM: Cool, no rush.
[Message 21] DAVID: Speaking of books, anyone read ""Silent Patient""?
[Message 22] CHLOE: Ooh, heard good things!
[Message 23] ANNA: It’s on my list.
[Message 24] LIAM: I'm more into thrillers.
[Message 25] DAVID: I like mysteries, myself.
[Message 26] CHLOE: Anyway, about Alex…did anyone know him well?
[Message 27] LIAM: Just from the bar, like I said.
[Message 28] ANNA: Same. Casual acquaintance.
[Message 29] DAVID: I think I saw him at the gym sometimes. Never talked to him.
[Message 30] CHLOE: Okay. Just wondering.
[Message 31] LIAM: Why? You thinking something suspicious?
[Message 32] CHLOE: I don't know... it's just... sudden.
[Message 33] ANNA: Accidents happen, Chloe.
[Message 34] DAVID: Yeah, let's not jump to conclusions.
[Message 35] CHLOE: Okay, okay. Just saying.
[Message 36] LIAM: So, movie night this weekend?
[Message 37] ANNA: I'm in!
[Message 38] DAVID: Count me in too.
[Message 39] CHLOE: I can bring snacks.
[Message 40] LIAM: Awesome. We need some cheering up after this news.
[Message 41] ANNA: Definitely.
[Message 42] DAVID: Agreed.
[Message 43] CHLOE: Okay, back to work. Talk later?
[Message 44] LIAM: Later.
[Message 45] ANNA: Bye!
[Message 46] DAVID: See ya.
[Message 47] GABRIEL: This whole thing with Alex is unsettling.
[Message 48] EMILY: I know, right? So sad.
[Message 49] GABRIEL: Did you hear any details?
[Message 50] EMILY: Just that it was an accident near the library.
[Message 51] GABRIEL: Weird place for an accident.
[Message 52] EMILY: I know. I was supposed to meet him for coffee there next week.
[Message 53] GABRIEL: You were? That's awful, Emily.
[Message 54] EMILY: Yeah, we were working on a project together.
[Message 55] GABRIEL: What kind of project?
[Message 56] EMILY: Just some research for a client.
[Message 57] GABRIEL: Hmmm.
[Message 58] EMILY: Why hmmm?
[Message 59] GABRIEL: Just seems like a coincidence. Bad timing.
[Message 60] EMILY: What are you implying, Gabriel?
[Message 61] GABRIEL: Nothing! Just saying it's strange.
[Message 62] EMILY: Look, I'm grieving. Don't start with me.
[Message 63] GABRIEL: Sorry, Emily. Didn't mean to upset you.
[Message 64] EMILY: It's fine. Just...leave it alone.
[Message 65] GABRIEL: Okay.
[Message 66] EMILY: I need to go.
[Message 67] GABRIEL: Yeah, take care.
[Message 68] ANNA: Hey Chloe, you still thinking about Alex?
[Message 69] CHLOE: Yeah, it's bothering me. Something feels off.
[Message 70] ANNA: Like what?
[Message 71] CHLOE: I don't know...I saw Emily talking to Alex a few days ago.
[Message 72] ANNA: And? Emily knew Alex.
[Message 73] CHLOE: Yeah, but she looked really intense. Like she was warning him about something.
[Message 74] ANNA: Maybe it was nothing.
[Message 75] CHLOE: Maybe.
[Message 76] ANNA: You're too suspicious, Chloe.
[Message 77] CHLOE: I just have a feeling.
[Message 78] ANNA: Well, don't go spreading rumors.
[Message 79] CHLOE: I won't. Just needed to vent.
[Message 80] ANNA: Okay. Want to grab coffee later?
[Message 81] CHLOE: Sure. That would be nice.
[Message 82] ANNA: Good. See you at 3?
[Message 83] CHLOE: Perfect.
[Message 84] EMILY: Gabriel, can we talk?
[Message 85] GABRIEL: Sure, what's up?
[Message 86] EMILY: I didn't like what you implied earlier.
[Message 87] GABRIEL: I apologized, Emily.
[Message 88] EMILY: I know, but it's still bothering me.
[Message 89] GABRIEL: I was just surprised you were working with Alex.
[Message 90] EMILY: It was just a freelance thing. I needed the money.
[Message 91] GABRIEL: Right.
[Message 92] EMILY: Look, I'm stressed out. I need you to trust me.
[Message 93] GABRIEL: I do trust you, Emily.
[Message 94] EMILY: Then stop questioning me.
[Message 95] GABRIEL: Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
[Message 96] EMILY: Thanks.
[Message 97] GABRIEL: Everything will be alright.
[Message 98] EMILY: I hope so.
[Message 99] DAVID: Liam, you okay? You seem quiet today.
[Message 100] LIAM: Just thinking about Alex. It's messed up.
[Message 101] DAVID: Yeah, it is. Anything else on your mind?
[Message 102] LIAM: Nah, just processing it.
[Message 103] DAVID: Want to grab a beer later?
[Message 104] LIAM: Maybe. I'll see how I feel.
[Message 105] DAVID: Alright. Just let me know.
[Message 106] LIAM: Cool.
[Message 107] ANNA: Chloe, coffee was great! Thanks.
[Message 108] CHLOE: Anytime! Glad we could catch up.
[Message 109] ANNA: Me too. Feel a bit better now.
[Message 110] CHLOE: Me too. Still can't shake the feeling about Emily, though.
[Message 111] ANNA: Give it a rest, Chloe. Honestly.
[Message 112] CHLOE: Okay, okay. I will.
[Message 113] ANNA: Good. See you Saturday?
[Message 114] CHLOE: Definitely!
[Message 115] ANNA: Perfect!
[Message 116] LIAM: David, you still up for that beer?
[Message 117] DAVID: Yeah, man. Meet you at The Tavern in an hour?
[Message 118] LIAM: Sounds good. See you there.
[Message 119] DAVID: Cool.
[Message 120] EMILY: Gabriel, I'm scared.
[Message 121] GABRIEL: What's wrong?
[Message 122] EMILY: The police called me. They want to ask me about Alex.
[Message 123] GABRIEL: What? Why?
[Message 124] EMILY: Because I was working with him! They said it's standard procedure.
[Message 125] GABRIEL: Okay, don't panic. Just tell them the truth.
[Message 126] EMILY: But what if they don't believe me?
[Message 127] GABRIEL: They will. You have nothing to hide, right?
[Message 128] EMILY: Right. I have nothing to hide. I didn't intend for any of this to happen, but now I'm thinking this is too severe of a crime to go unpunished.
[Message 129] GABRIEL: Exactly. So just be honest.
[Message 130] EMILY: Okay. I'll try.
[Message 131] GABRIEL: You got this.
[Message 132] DAVID: Liam, you seem really on edge. What's going on?
[Message 133] LIAM: It's nothing, man. Just a long day.
[Message 134] DAVID: You sure? You're acting weird.
[Message 135] LIAM: I'm fine, David. Drop it.
[Message 136] DAVID: Okay, okay. Just checking.
[Message 137] LIAM: Thanks.
[Message 138] DAVID: So, you think they'll find out what really happened to Alex? I heard the manager was making a lot of enemies with his new rules.
[Message 139] LIAM: I hope so. Justice needs to be served. Even if it means a long prison sentence for someone.
[Message 140] CHLOE: Anna, I was thinking...Emily seemed to be at Library more often lately.
[Message 141] ANNA: So? Maybe she likes books.
[Message 142] CHLOE: I don't know, it just feels...convenient.
[Message 143] ANNA: You're grasping at straws, Chloe.
[Message 144] CHLOE: Maybe you're right.
[Message 145] ANNA: I am right. Let the police do their job.
[Message 146] CHLOE: Fine. But I still don't trust her.
[Message 147] ANNA: That's your problem.
[Message 148] GABRIEL: How did it go with the police, Emily?
[Message 149] EMILY: It was awful, Gabriel. They kept asking me about my relationship with Alex.
[Message 150] GABRIEL: And what did you say?
[Message 151] EMILY: I told them the truth! That we were just working together.
[Message 152] GABRIEL: Did they seem to believe you?
[Message 153] EMILY: I don't know. They were being so vague.
[Message 154] GABRIEL: Well, at least it's over.
[Message 155] EMILY: I hope so.
[Message 156] GABRIEL: You need to relax, Emily. It's going to be okay.
[Message 157] EMILY: I wish I could believe that.
[Message 158] DAVID: So, Liam, you think Alex's death was just an accident?
[Message 159] LIAM: I don't know what to think, David. It's all just messed up. I saw her buying some Car accident (vehicular homicide) last week.
[Message 160] DAVID: Emily? You saw Emily buying Car accident (vehicular homicide)? When was this?
[Message 161] LIAM: Yeah, at the hardware store. It was just a quick glance, but I'm sure it was her. It had to have happened right before he went over there.
[Message 162] DAVID: That's... concerning. You should tell the police.
[Message 163] LIAM: I don't know, man. I don't want to get involved.
[Message 164] DAVID: But Alex is dead, Liam! He always hated Alex . Someone needs to do something.
[Message 165] LIAM: I know, I know. I'll think about it.
[Message 166] DAVID: Don't wait too long, Liam.
[Message 167] LIAM: Okay.
[Message 168] CHLOE: Anna, Liam told David that he saw Emily buying Car accident (vehicular homicide).
[Message 169] ANNA: What?! Are you serious?
[Message 170] CHLOE: Dead serious. He didn't want to get involved.
[Message 171] ANNA: This is crazy.
[Message 172] CHLOE: I know! I knew something was up with her!
[Message 173] ANNA: We need to tell the police.
[Message 174] CHLOE: I agree. Let's go together.
[Message 175] ANNA: Okay. Meet me in 30 minutes?
[Message 176] CHLOE: Perfect. This is it.
[Message 177] ANNA: Let's hope they get her. He said she wanted to get rid of him.
[Message 178] ANNA: The police need to act fast.
[Message 179] ANNA: This is for Alex.
[Message 180] CHLOE: For Alex.",1,

[Message 2] River: ""Liam! Hey! Long time no see. Filling up?""
[Message 3] Kai: ""Hey Liam. Yeah, grabbing gas. How you been?""
[Message 4] Liam: ""Good, good. Still crunching numbers. You know how it is.""
[Message 5] River: ""Always. Trying to stay afloat, myself. Work's been crazy busy.""
[Message 6] Kai: ""Tell me about it. Flu season hitting hard. So many prescriptions.""
[Message 7] Liam: ""Damn, sounds rough. So, what are you guys up to these days? Any exciting goals?""
[Message 8] River: ""I'm trying to watch all the Best Picture winners. Ambitious, I know.""
[Message 9] Kai: ""That is ambitious. I'm trying to finally get my classic Mustang running again. It's been sitting in the garage for too long.""
[Message 10] Liam: ""Ooh, nice! I saw a gorgeous '67 Fastback the other day. Dream car.""
[Message 11] River: ""Speaking of cars, you still driving that beat-up Corolla, Liam?""
[Message 12] Liam: ""Hey, she's reliable! But yeah, saving up for something a little nicer. Maybe a used Accord. Sensible, you know?""
[Message 13] Kai: ""Accords are solid. Good choice. Back to goals, though, I also want to get back into racing, maybe hit up Summit Point.""
[Message 14] River: ""Racing? Wow, Kai! I didn't know you were into that!""
[Message 15] Liam: ""Seriously? That's awesome! I'd love to come watch sometime. I'm always up for some good sports.""
[Message 16] Kai: ""Definitely! Once I get the Mustang roadworthy. What about you, Liam? Financial analyst stuff aside, any personal goals?""
[Message 17] Liam: ""Trying to get better at tennis. My backhand is atrocious.""
[Message 18] River: ""Tennis, huh? I tried that once. Ended up mostly chasing the ball into the bushes.""
[Message 19] Kai: ""Haha, relatable. I'm terrible at racquet sports. Give me a steering wheel any day.""
[Message 20] Liam: ""Yeah, it's a challenge. But good exercise. Plus, the pros are incredible to watch.""
[Message 21] River: ""True. What's your favorite movie right now, Kai?""
[Message 22] Kai: ""Probably 'Ford v Ferrari.' Predictable, I know, given my interests.""
[Message 23] Liam: ""Solid choice! Great cinematography.""
[Message 24] River: ""I liked it too! Matt Damon's awesome. I'm currently obsessed with 'Parasite'. It's a masterpiece.""
[Message 25] Liam: ""Haven't seen that one yet. Adding it to my list.""

[Message 27] River: ""Same here. Got a super early start tomorrow. Gotta get to bed.""

[Message 31] Liam: ""Later, Kai! Drive safe!""
[Message 32] River: ""Bye Kai! See ya!""
[Message 33] Liam: ""So, River, Best Picture winners, huh? How far back are you going?""
[Message 34] River: ""All the way! Started with 'Wings' from 1927. It's... interesting.""
[Message 35] Liam: ""Wow, dedication! That's impressive.""
[Message 36] River: ""Yeah, well, I have a lot of free time, apparently. Plus, it's kinda cool to see how movies have changed over the decades.""
[Message 37] Liam: ""That's true. You could write a whole thesis on that.""
[Message 38] River: ""Haha, don't tempt me. My next goal is to actually finish that screenplay I started like five years ago.""
[Message 39] Liam: ""Now that's something! What's it about?""
[Message 40] River: ""It's a romantic comedy about a librarian and a…wait for it…a taxidermist.""
[Message 41] Liam: ""Okay, that's actually amazing. I'd watch that.""
[Message 42] River: ""Thanks! I just need to find the time and motivation to actually finish it.""
[Message 43] Liam: ""Motivation is tough. Maybe set small, achievable goals? Like, write one scene a week?""
[Message 44] River: ""Good idea. I might try that. What about your backhand? Any progress?""
[Message 45] Liam: ""Slow and steady. I'm taking lessons. My instructor says I need to bend my knees more.""
[Message 46] River: ""Knees, huh? Sounds painful. I prefer sitting in a comfy chair and watching movies.""
[Message 47] Liam: ""Haha, fair enough. To each their own. Hey, speaking of movies, did you see that new superhero flick?""
[Message 48] River: ""Which one? There are like a million of them these days.""
[Message 49] Liam: ""The one with the talking raccoon. Apparently, it's hilarious.""
[Message 50] River: ""Oh, yeah! I heard it was good. Might check that out this weekend.""
[Message 51] Liam: ""Same. I need a good laugh.""
[Message 52] River: ""Me too. Okay, well, I should probably head home. This was nice, Liam.""
[Message 53] Liam: ""Yeah, it was great seeing you, River! Let's actually plan something soon.""
[Message 54] River: ""Definitely! I'll text you. Take care!""
[Message 55] Liam: ""You too! Drive safe!""
[Message 56] River: ""Will do!""
[Message 57] Liam: ""(To himself) Alright, gotta go home and practice those knee bends...""
[Message 58] Liam: ""Okay, now seriously gotta get home. This gas station is getting weird.""
[Message 59] Liam: ""Wait, did I leave my phone on the roof of my car again?!""
[Message 60] Liam: ""Nope, crisis averted. False alarm. Carry on.""
[Message 61] Liam: ""I need more sleep. Definitely need more sleep.""
[Message 62] Liam: ""Okay, car started. Let's roll.""

[Message 65] Liam: ""Home sweet home, soon.""
[Message 66] Liam: ""Traffic's not too bad, surprisingly.""
[Message 67] Liam: ""Thinking about River's screenplay... a librarian and a taxidermist... genius.""
[Message 68] Liam: ""Maybe I should offer to read it when she finishes a draft.""
[Message 69] Liam: ""Nah, I'd probably just give her terrible advice. Stick to numbers, Liam. Stick to numbers.""
[Message 70] Liam: ""Although... I do have some pretty good ideas for the climax...""
[Message 71] Liam: ""Stop it, Liam. Focus on the road.""
[Message 72] Liam: ""Okay, okay. Back to tennis. Bend those knees.""
[Message 73] Liam: ""And stop hitting the ball into the net. That's embarrassing.""
[Message 74] Liam: ""Maybe I should watch some tennis videos on YouTube. That might help.""
[Message 75] Liam: ""Or maybe I should just hire a better instructor.""
[Message 76] Liam: ""Nah, this guy's alright. He just needs to be a little more…motivating.""
[Message 77] Liam: ""Maybe I'll bring him coffee next time. Everyone likes coffee.""
[Message 78] Liam: ""Except for River, probably. She seems like more of a tea person.""
[Message 79] Liam: ""Okay, almost home. Just a few more blocks.""
[Message 80] Liam: ""Time to relax and maybe watch some old tennis matches.""
[Message 81] Liam: ""And try not to think about work. That's the goal.""
[Message 82] Liam: ""Although, that new quarterly report is kind of interesting…""
[Message 83] Liam: ""No, Liam! No work thoughts! Relax!""
[Message 84] Liam: ""Home. Sweet. Home.""
[Message 85] Liam: ""Time to unwind.""

[Message 87] Liam: ""Pizza sounds good. Or maybe Chinese food…""
[Message 88] Liam: ""Decisions, decisions…""
[Message 89] Liam: ""Pizza it is. Easy and satisfying.""
[Message 90] Liam: ""Okay, ordering now…""
[Message 91] Liam: ""Pepperoni and mushroom. Classic.""
[Message 92] Liam: ""Alright, pizza's on its way. Time for some tennis on YouTube.""
[Message 93] Liam: ""Federer's backhand…now that's something to aspire to.""
[Message 94] Liam: ""Maybe in another lifetime…""

[Message 103] River: ""(Texting) Tuesday's good. How about 10 am?""

[Message 123] Liam: ""(Texting) Yeah, glad you're home safe! Traffic around here is always a nightmare.""
[Message 124] Kai: ""(Texting) Thanks, guys. Hey, River, I'll bring that Ford v Ferrari DVD next time we hang out.""
[Message 125] River: ""(Texting) Oh, awesome! Thanks, Kai! I'll bring the popcorn!""
[Message 126] Liam: ""(Texting) Popcorn sounds good! Can I come too? I'll bring the drinks!""
[Message 127] Kai: ""(Texting) Of course, Liam! The more the merrier! I'll let you know when I'm free.""
[Message 128] River: ""(Texting) Perfect! Looking forward to it!""
[Message 129] Liam: ""(Texting) Sounds great! Talk to you guys soon!""

[Message 2] LIAM: Yeah, just tired. Long day at work. You know how it is.
[Message 3] CHLOE: True. Speaking of, did you hear about what happened near the airport?
[Message 4] LIAM: Airport? No, what's up?
[Message 5] CHLOE: Some activist, Daniel, was shot. Dead.
[Message 6] LIAM: Wow, seriously? That's awful.
[Message 7] MIA: Chloe, you won't believe what Mr. Thompson said today! Promotion material is out!
[Message 8] CHLOE: OMG Mia! Congrats! We need to celebrate!
[Message 9] MIA: I know, right?! But later. Gotta prep this presentation. Hey, did you hear about Daniel?
[Message 10] CHLOE: Yeah, Liam just told me. Scary stuff.
[Message 11] LIAM: Makes you think, you know? Life's too short to be stressed about work.
[Message 12] MIA: Tell me about it. Thompson's been riding my back all week. I swear, I could kill him. (jk, obvs)
[Message 13] CHLOE: Lol, I feel that. So, Liam, what were you doing yesterday afternoon?
[Message 14] LIAM: Working, like I said. Why?
[Message 15] CHLOE: Just curious. Small town, everyone's a suspect, right?
[Message 16] LIAM: Ha, funny.
[Message 17] MIA: Seriously Chloe, not cool. People are grieving.
[Message 18] CHLOE: Sorry, sorry. Just trying to lighten the mood.
[Message 19] LIAM: It's fine. Really. Anyway, gotta run. Meeting.
[Message 20] CHLOE: Later. Mia, you free for drinks Friday?
[Message 21] MIA: Definitely! Need to vent about Thompson anyway.
[Message 22] JAKE: Yo, Mia. You hear about Daniel? Crazy.
[Message 23] MIA: Yeah, Jake. Chloe told me. What's your take?
[Message 24] JAKE: Dunno man. Bad for business around here. I heard he was causing trouble with some developers.
[Message 25] MIA: Developers? Interesting...
[Message 26] CHLOE: Jake, you know anything about that?
[Message 27] JAKE: Nah, just gossip. You know how it is.
[Message 28] CHLOE: True. Well, if you hear anything...
[Message 29] JAKE: Will do. Later.
[Message 30] MIA: Jake's acting weird.
[Message 31] CHLOE: Tell me about it. He was really chummy with Daniel last week.
[Message 32] MIA: Maybe he's just shocked.
[Message 33] CHLOE: Maybe. Hey, did Liam seem different to you too?
[Message 34] MIA: Different how?
[Message 35] CHLOE: Just... distant. Like he was hiding something.
[Message 36] MIA: You're being paranoid.
[Message 37] CHLOE: Probably. But still...
[Message 38] LIAM: Guys, this is getting out of hand. Leave it to the police.
[Message 39] CHLOE: We're just talking, Liam. Relax.
[Message 40] LIAM: Talking can turn into rumors. Just be careful.
[Message 41] MIA: Liam's right. Let's change the subject.
[Message 42] CHLOE: Fine. But something's definitely off.
[Message 43] JAKE: I saw Liam leaving the building near the airport around late afternoon yesterday.
[Message 44] MIA: Really, Jake? You sure?
[Message 45] JAKE: Pretty sure. He was walking fast.
[Message 46] CHLOE: Liam? What was that about?
[Message 47] LIAM: I... I had a doctor's appointment near there.
[Message 48] CHLOE: A doctor's appointment? Why didn't you say so?
[Message 49] LIAM: Didn't think it was relevant.
[Message 50] MIA: What kind of appointment?
[Message 51] LIAM: Just a check-up. Nothing major.
[Message 52] JAKE: What checkup needs you at the airport?
[Message 53] LIAM: It was a specialist, okay? Can we drop this?
[Message 54] CHLOE: Sure, Liam. Whatever you say.
[Message 55] MIA: Chloe, seriously, stop.
[Message 56] CHLOE: I'm just saying... it's a lot of coincidences.
[Message 57] JAKE: Daniel knew something. About the airport expansion plans, I heard.
[Message 58] MIA: The ones Thompson's been pushing?
[Message 59] JAKE: Maybe.
[Message 60] CHLOE: Thompson wanted to get rid of Daniel, that's obvious.
[Message 61] LIAM: This is insane. You're accusing everyone.
[Message 62] MIA: Liam's right. Chloe, you're going too far.
[Message 63] CHLOE: Fine, fine. I'm done.
[Message 64] JAKE: It's all messed up. Poor guy. Hope they catch whoever did it. They're going away for a long time for this.
[Message 65] MIA: Me too. Justice for Daniel.
[Message 66] LIAM: Agreed. Justice for Daniel.
[Message 67] CHLOE: Yeah, justice.
[Message 68] MIA: Ugh, I have so much work to do. Thompson's gonna kill me.
[Message 69] CHLOE: Remember Friday, drinks?
[Message 70] MIA: Yes! Need it more than ever now.
[Message 71] LIAM: Guys, I’m out. Head’s killing me.
[Message 72] CHLOE: Feel better, Liam.
[Message 73] MIA: Yeah, hope you feel better.
[Message 74] JAKE: Take it easy, Liam.
[Message 75] CHLOE: So, Mia... Jake seems to know a lot, right? Especially about Daniel and Thompson.
[Message 76] MIA: He does. But he's always been a gossip.
[Message 77] CHLOE: Maybe. Or maybe he was involved somehow. He's the one who failed to call 911 after the victim was hurt, making the harm worse.
[Message 78] MIA: He was at the scene?
[Message 79] CHLOE: Just a hunch.
[Message 80] MIA: You're exhausting, you know that?
[Message 81] CHLOE: But am I wrong?
[Message 82] MIA: I don't know. And frankly, I don't want to know.
[Message 83] CHLOE: Fair enough.
[Message 84] MIA: Thompson was furious with Daniel. Everyone knew that.
[Message 85] CHLOE: Yeah, Thompson is really aware that Daniel wanted to delay the project.
[Message 86] MIA: I should focus on my job. This promotion is a big deal.
[Message 87] CHLOE: You deserve it.
[Message 88] MIA: Thanks. Seriously, let's just drop the murder talk for now.
[Message 89] CHLOE: Okay, okay. Drinks on Friday then? My treat.
[Message 90] MIA: Deal. Can't wait to celebrate!
[Message 91] JAKE: Hey. I deleted my previous messages.
[Message 92] MIA: What are you talking about Jake?

[Message 92] Maya: ""Foul play… I knew it. I just knew it.""
[Message 93] Chloe: ""Don't jump to conclusions, Maya. Let's wait for the facts.""
[Message 94] Leo: ""Yeah, we don't want to start pointing fingers without evidence.""
[Message 95] Sam: ""The detective asked me specifically where I was Late Afternoon last Tuesday.""
[Message 96] Maya: ""That's suspicious. Where *were* you?""
[Message 97] Chloe: ""Ooh, interrogation time.""
[Message 98] Leo: ""Haha, seriously, Sam. Where were you?""
[Message 99] Sam: ""I was at home, working. I had a massive deadline. I can prove it with timestamps on my files.""
[Message 100] Maya: ""Okay, good. Alibi confirmed.""
[Message 101] Chloe: ""Anyone else get the third degree?""
[Message 102] Leo: ""Not yet. Maybe I’m not interesting enough.""
[Message 103] Sam: ""They'll probably talk to all of us eventually. Just be prepared.""
[Message 104] Maya: ""I'm going to try to get some sleep. This is exhausting.""
[Message 105] Chloe: ""Night, Maya. Sweet dreams (hopefully).""
[Message 106] Leo: ""Sleep well. We're all here for you.""
[Message 107] Sam: ""Goodnight.""
[Message 108] Maya: ""Thanks, guys.""
[Message 109] Chloe: ""Did David ever mention anything about life insurance?""
[Message 110] Leo: ""That's a bit morbid, Chloe, don't you think?""
[Message 111] Sam: ""Yeah, kinda insensitive.""
[Message 112] Chloe: ""I'm just thinking practically. If something happened to him, who benefits? Money is a motive.""
[Message 113] Leo: ""True, but still… maybe focus on finding him first?""
[Message 114] Sam: ""I agree with Leo. Let’s not start planning his funeral yet.""
[Message 115] Chloe: ""Fair enough. Just saying, it’s something the police will probably look into anyway.""
[Message 116] Leo: ""Anyone else craving pizza?""
[Message 117] Sam: ""Always.""
[Message 118] Maya: ""Pizza sounds good, actually. Comfort food.""
[Message 119] Chloe: ""I’m in. Let’s order a large.""
[Message 120] Leo: ""My treat. Consider it stress relief.""
[Message 121] Sam: ""Awesome. Thanks, Leo.""
[Message 122] Maya: ""I'm still at the police station. They found David.""
[Message 123] Chloe: ""Found him? Is he okay?""
[Message 124] Leo: ""Oh my god, Maya, tell us!""
[Message 125] Sam: ""Please be okay…""
[Message 126] Maya: ""He's… he's dead. Someone pushed him off the top of the parking garage.""
[Message 127] Chloe: ""What?! No! This can't be happening.""
[Message 128] Leo: ""Oh no… I don't believe it.""
[Message 129] Sam: ""No way. Who would do that?""
[Message 130] Maya: ""They're calling it murder. They said he died at Late Afternoon.""
[Message 131] Chloe: ""Murder? Oh god, this is a nightmare. Poor David.""
[Message 132] Leo: ""This is awful. Absolutely awful. I can't even process this.""
[Message 133] Sam: ""Who would want to hurt him? This makes no sense.""
[Message 134] Maya: ""The detective just said he wanted to know if anyone knew that David hates heights and that he would never go up there willingly.""
[Message 135] Chloe: ""I can’t believe anyone would actually intentionally kill David. He didn’t deserve this.""
[Message 136] Leo: ""This is unreal. It's like something out of a movie. He just wanted to take care of his family. It’s not fair.""
[Message 137] Sam: ""Absolutely tragic. I'm completely numb. I intended on seeing him succeed.""
[Message 138] Maya: ""I’m so angry I could scream. The cops said someone used a falling object to make it look like suicide.""
[Message 139] Chloe: ""What will happen to the Anderson report? I really needed it.""
[Message 140] Leo: ""The Anderson report can wait, Chloe! Someone is dead!""
[Message 141] Sam: ""Seriously, Chloe? Show some respect.""
[Message 142] Chloe: ""I didn't mean it like that! I'm just stressed, okay? We're all stressed.""
[Message 143] Maya: ""They are pulling security footage and they know someone went up there with him around the time of the incident. He was also talking about getting rid of him at the time.""
[Message 144] Chloe: ""It could be anyone. There are lots of people who go up to that parking garage.""
[Message 145] Leo: ""I feel like I’m going to throw up. Is the person going to prison?""
[Message 146] Sam: ""A murder investigation? They’re going away for a long time for this.""
[Message 147] Maya: ""They will find out who did this and they will pay.""
[Message 148] Chloe: ""So what happens now?""
[Message 149] Leo: ""We grieve. We remember him. We help the police however we can.""
[Message 150] Sam: ""And we support each other. This is going to be tough.""
[Message 151] Maya: ""I don't know if I can face work tomorrow. Or ever.""
[Message 152] Chloe: ""Take the time you need, Maya. We understand.""
[Message 153] Leo: ""Yeah, don't worry about anything. Just focus on yourself.""
[Message 154] Sam: ""We'll cover for you. Just let us know what you need.""
[Message 155] Maya: ""Thank you. You guys are the best.""
[Message 156] Chloe: ""We’re a team, Maya. We stick together. The manager is going to have to understand""
[Message 157] Leo: ""Exactly. Always.""
[Message 158] Sam: ""For David.""
[Message 159] Maya: ""For David.""
[Message 160] Chloe: ""For David.""
[Message 161] Leo: ""Did anyone ever think David was weird?""
[Message 162] Sam: ""Sometimes, but in a good way. Creative. Unique.""
[Message 163] Maya: ""He was quirky, sure. But harmless. He loved his activist work""
[Message 164] Chloe: ""He never talked about his family much. Did anyone know he had a sister?""
[Message 165] Leo: ""I didn’t. Surprising, actually. You would figure that he would.""
[Message 166] Sam: ""It's hard to imagine.""
[Message 167] Maya: ""He kept mostly to himself. It's hard to imagine that someone purposefully hurt him.""
[Message 168] Chloe: ""Hope they don’t get the death penalty. Seems too harsh.""
[Message 169] Leo: ""This is not the time, Chloe.""

[Message 2] River: Yep! Just finished ordering. You should try the pimento cheese fries.
[Message 3] Amelia: Pimento cheese fries, noted! Are they busy?
[Message 4] River: Not too bad, a decent crowd though. What are you up to this evening?
[Message 5] Amelia: Planning to talk with the community group after dinner. They're discussing the park clean-up next month.
[Message 6] River: Oh, cool! The park clean-up? I saw a flyer for that.
[Message 7] Amelia: Yeah! I think it's important to give back to the community. Plus, it's a good way to meet people.
[Message 8] River: Definitely. I’ve been meaning to get more involved. Been too focused on work lately.
[Message 9] Amelia: I understand that. Being a mechanic takes a lot of focus. How's that old Ford you were working on coming along?
[Message 10] River: It's…a project. Let's just say I'm learning a lot about carburetors. You know your way around cars, right?
[Message 11] Amelia: You could say that. 74 years old, and I've been under the hood of something since I was a kid. Maybe I can lend a hand sometime.
[Message 12] River: Seriously? That would be amazing!
[Message 13] Amelia: Absolutely. Anyway, back to the park clean-up – any chance you'd be interested in joining?
[Message 14] River: Yeah, I’d be down! What kind of stuff do they need help with?
[Message 15] Amelia: Mostly just picking up trash, maybe some light weeding. They’re also trying to organize a planting day after.
[Message 16] River: Planting day sounds fun! I haven't done that since I was little.
[Message 17] Amelia: Great! I'll connect you with Sarah, she's organizing the whole thing. She’s really passionate about it.
[Message 18] River: Awesome. Thanks, Amelia! I appreciate it.
[Message 19] Amelia: No problem at all. So, pimento cheese fries... what else is good there?
[Message 20] River: The wings are pretty good too. They have a dry rub that's amazing.
[Message 21] Amelia: Hmm, wings sound tempting. I might have to try those. What are you wearing tonight? Just curious.
[Message 22] River: Haha, just jeans and a t-shirt. Comfort is key. You?
[Message 23] Amelia: Same here! Jeans and a comfy sweater. It's a bit chilly this evening.
[Message 24] River: True. I should have grabbed my jacket. Oh, they're bringing out the fries now!
[Message 25] Amelia: Perfect timing! Enjoy! I should be there in about 15 minutes.
[Message 26] River: Sounds good! See you soon. And definitely ask for extra napkins with those fries.
[Message 27] Amelia: Will do! Extra napkins acquired. Talk to you soon.
[Message 28] River: Quick question – are you going to drive your Mustang? I always admire that car.
[Message 29] Amelia: You know it! She's a classic. I'll park where you can see her.
[Message 30] River: Sweet! I'll keep an eye out.
[Message 31] Amelia: Speaking of classics, have you ever thought about restoring cars as a hobby?
[Message 32] River: I’ve considered it! I love the idea, but I think I need to get my carburetor skills up to par first.
[Message 33] Amelia: (Laughing) Fair enough! It’s definitely a learning process. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was a perfectly restored car.
[Message 34] River: You got that right. By the way, have you seen that new exhibit at the Mint Museum? I heard it’s pretty cool.
[Message 35] Amelia: The art museum? No, I haven't. What's it about?
[Message 36] River: Apparently it’s a fashion exhibit, focusing on sustainable clothing.
[Message 37] Amelia: Sustainable clothing? Interesting. I'll have to check that out sometime. I'm more of a function-over-fashion kind of person, though.
[Message 38] River: Totally understandable! Me, I'm a bit of both. I like looking good, but I also care about where my clothes come from.
[Message 39] Amelia: That's a good balance to have. Well, I'm almost there. Just pulled into the parking lot.
[Message 40] River: Great! I'm inside by the window. Should be easy to spot me.
[Message 41] Amelia: Perfect! I see you. Be right in!
[Message 42] Amelia: (Inside Elevator) Okay, I'm here! Those fries smell amazing!
[Message 43] River: Told you! Glad you made it. Ready to talk community stuff?
[Message 44] Amelia: Almost! Let me just grab a drink and some of those fries. Then, community brainstorming!
[Message 45] River: Sounds like a plan. I already have my drink.
[Message 46] Amelia: Excellent! This park clean-up is going to be a success, I can feel it.
[Message 47] River: I hope so! It would be nice to see the park looking its best.
[Message 48] Amelia: Absolutely. It's such a vital part of the neighborhood. Kids play there, people walk their dogs...
[Message 49] River: Exactly. And a clean park just makes everyone feel better.
[Message 50] Amelia: What kind of ideas do you have for making the clean-up more effective?
[Message 51] River: Hmm, maybe we could organize different teams for different tasks? Like a trash team, a weeding team, etc.
[Message 52] Amelia: That’s a great idea! Keeps things organized and efficient.
[Message 53] River: And maybe we could offer some kind of small incentive for volunteers? Like a raffle or something.
[Message 54] Amelia: I love that! A raffle for a gift certificate to a local business would be a nice touch.
[Message 55] River: Yeah! Support local while supporting the park. Two birds, one stone.
[Message 56] Amelia: Brilliant! I'll suggest that to Sarah. She'll be thrilled.
[Message 57] River: Speaking of Sarah, what other community initiatives is she involved in?
[Message 58] Amelia: She's also working on a community garden project.
[Message 59] River: A community garden? That sounds amazing!
[Message 60] Amelia: It is! They're hoping to grow fresh produce for the local food bank.
[Message 61] River: Wow, that's really impactful. I'd love to get involved with that too.
[Message 62] Amelia: I'll connect you with her for that as well. She’s always looking for volunteers.
[Message 63] River: Awesome, thanks again, Amelia! You’re really inspiring me to be more active in the community.
[Message 64] Amelia: It's easy when you're surrounded by good people! Now, back to these pimento cheese fries…
[Message 65] River: Haha, enjoy! We can brainstorm more ideas later. This community is lucky to have you",0,
576,"[Message 1] Brenda: Good morning, everyone! Thinking about starting a little side hustle. Any advice from you seasoned professionals?
[Message 2] George: Morning, Brenda! Side hustle, eh? What are you thinking of doing?
[Message 3] Susan: Good morning! I'm intrigued, Brenda. Definitely been there, done that. Happy to share what I've learned.
[Message 4] Brenda: Well, I'm pretty good with plants. Thinking of maybe selling some of my succulents and propagating them.
[Message 5] George: Ah, gardening! Nice. I'd say, figure out your market first. Who are you selling to?
[Message 6] Susan: Pricing is key too. Research what others are charging for similar items. Don't undersell yourself.
[Message 7] Brenda: Good point, Susan. I was thinking of starting small, maybe at the local farmers market.
[Message 8] George: Farmers market is a great idea! Low overhead and you can gauge interest.
[Message 9] Susan: Definitely good for initial exposure. Think about branding too - even a simple logo can help.
[Message 10] Brenda: Branding...hmm. Didn't even think that far ahead. I'm getting ahead of myself!
[Message 11] George: Nah, it's good to consider the long game! Just a simple sign or something.
[Message 12] Susan: I agree with George. Also, think about your unique selling proposition. What makes your succulents special?
[Message 13] Brenda: Well, I use organic fertilizer and I’m pretty good at creating unusual arrangements.
[Message 14] George: Organic is a big selling point these days! Play that up.
[Message 15] Susan: Definitely! Market that ""organic"" aspect. People are willing to pay a premium.
[Message 16] Brenda: Okay, organic it is! Any advice on dealing with difficult customers?
[Message 17] George: Patience is key. And a smile, even if it's forced.
[Message 18] Susan: Absolutely, George is right. And don't take things personally. Some people are just…like that.
[Message 19] Brenda: I can see that. I tend to get a little flustered when confronted.
[Message 20] George: It takes practice. Remember, the customer is always *trying* to be right.
[Message 21] Susan: Haha, George! True that. Choose your battles, Brenda. Sometimes it's just not worth arguing.
[Message 22] Brenda: I appreciate that. By the way, did you guys see that new dog park they're building downtown?
[Message 23] George: Dog park? No, I hadn't heard. Good for the city, I guess.
[Message 24] Susan: Oh yes, I saw the signs! It’s near the Wee Hours coffee shop, right?
[Message 25] Brenda: That's the one! Anyway, back to the succulents...
[Message 26] George: Right, succulents! So, marketing strategy...beyond the farmers market.
[Message 27] Susan: Think about online sales, Brenda. Etsy or even just a Facebook page.
[Message 28] Brenda: Good idea! I'm a bit of a technophobe though.
[Message 29] George: My granddaughter could help you with that. She's a whiz with computers.
[Message 30] Brenda: Oh, that would be wonderful, George! I really appreciate it.
[Message 31] Susan: Or there are plenty of YouTube tutorials for setting up a basic online store.
[Message 32] Brenda: I'll check those out too. You guys are a wealth of information!
[Message 33] George: We've been around the block a few times! Just happy to help.
[Message 34] Susan: Exactly! And remember, don't be afraid to experiment and learn from your mistakes.
[Message 35] Brenda: Mistakes...that's the scary part!
[Message 36] George: Everyone makes them, Brenda! It's part of the process. Just learn from them and move on.
[Message 37] Susan: Precisely. Think of them as learning opportunities disguised as setbacks.
[Message 38] Brenda: I like that perspective. Thank you both so much! I feel much more prepared now.
[Message 39] George: Anytime, Brenda! Good luck with your succulent venture.
[Message 40] Susan: Yes, good luck! Let us know how it goes!",0,

[Message 127] Liam: ""Night, Noah.""
[Message 128] Maya: ""Goodnight.""
[Message 129] Daniel: ""Night.""
[Message 130] Liam: ""Maya, do you remember anything specific about when you saw Jamie and Mark talking?""
[Message 131] Maya: ""It was a few weeks ago at that coffee shop near the park. They seemed to be arguing actually. Jamie seemed really angry.""
[Message 132] Liam: ""Damn. That's worth telling the cops.""
[Message 133] Daniel: ""Wonder what they were arguing about.""
[Message 134] Maya: ""I don't know. I couldn't hear what they were saying.""
[Message 135] Liam: ""Okay, good to know. I'm going to try and get some sleep too.""
[Message 136] Maya: ""Me too. Night.""
[Message 137] Liam: ""Night.""
[Message 138] Daniel: ""Later.""
[Message 139] Chloe: ""I just remembered something... Sarah mentioned she was meeting someone at the park that night. She wouldn't say who.""
[Message 140] Liam: ""Damn, Chloe. That's HUGE.""
[Message 141] Maya: ""Definitely tell the police that ASAP.""
[Message 142] Noah: ""Wow, that changes everything.""
[Message 143] Daniel: ""Probably a secret lover or something. This just got interesting.""
[Message 144] Chloe: ""I already told them. They seemed interested.""
[Message 145] Liam: ""Good. I hope they catch this maniac.""
[Message 146] Maya: ""Me too. This is so heartbreaking.""
[Message 147] Noah: ""Hopefully they find out who it was soon.""
[Message 148] Daniel: ""I knew it. Sarah was playing with fire. Probably had it coming.""
[Message 149] Chloe: ""What is wrong with you, Daniel?""
[Message 150] Liam: ""Seriously, Daniel. Shut up.""
[Message 151] Maya: ""You're disgusting.""
[Message 152] Noah: ""Unbelievable.""
[Message 153] Daniel: ""What? Just being realistic.""
[Message 154] Chloe: ""I'm done with this conversation.""
[Message 155] Liam: ""Yeah, me too.""
[Message 156] Maya: ""Good riddance.""
[Message 157] Noah: ""Unfollowing.""
[Message 158] Daniel: ""Fine by me. You all are too sensitive.""
[Message 159] Liam: ""Did anyone notice Daniel didn't seem surprised? Like he intended Sarah was gonna die?""
[Message 160] Maya: ""Now that you mention it... he did seem a little too calm. Knew she was doing journalism.""
[Message 161] Noah: ""He said he moved away from the park because it's too dangerous. Maybe he was aware of Sarah's intentions to meet with someone.""
[Message 162] Liam: ""I saw Daniel at the gun store buying Shooting with a handgun a week ago.""
[Message 163] Maya: ""Oh my god. This is getting scary. He's wanted to get rid of him.""
[Message 164] Noah: ""Maybe he and Jamie conspired. Or maybe Daniel and Jamie knew about the meet-up, and decided to take matters into their own hands.""
[Message 165] Liam: ""We should call the police. Like, now.""
[Message 166] Maya: ""Absolutely. This is beyond messed up.""
[Message 167] Noah: ""Agreed. I'm calling right now.""
[Message 168] Liam: ""Stay safe, you two.""

[Message 2] Dale: ""Hey Alex! Yeah, figured I would. Heard they're showing the city council meeting highlights.""
[Message 3] Alex: ""Ugh, city council. Sounds riveting. Anything interesting come out of it?""
[Message 4] Dale: ""Apparently, that zoning dispute on Mesa Street is still dragging on.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""Seriously? That's been going on for months. I thought they were close to a resolution.""
[Message 6] Dale: ""Nope. More delays. Apparently, the neighborhood association filed another objection.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""That's gotta be frustrating for everyone involved. Especially the developers.""
[Message 8] Dale: ""Tell me about it. My cousin's working on that project. He's pulling his hair out.""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Oh wow, small world! Tell him I said hang in there. Maybe he needs a round of arcade games to de-stress.""
[Message 10] Dale: ""Haha, I will. Speaking of arcade games, I'm trying to beat my high score on Pac-Man.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""Good luck with that! I'm more of a Ms. Pac-Man kinda guy myself.""
[Message 12] Dale: ""To each their own! Anyway, back to the city council, they also talked about the new park downtown.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""Oh yeah, I saw something about that. The one on San Jacinto Plaza?""
[Message 14] Dale: ""That's the one. Apparently, they're adding a new dog park section.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""That's cool! My neighbor will be thrilled. He's always complaining about the lack of dog-friendly spaces.""
[Message 16] Dale: ""Exactly! It's supposed to be done by next spring.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""That's a pretty ambitious timeline. Hopefully, they can stick to it.""
[Message 18] Dale: ""Fingers crossed. Hey, did you hear about that networking event next week at the convention center?""
[Message 19] Alex: ""Networking event? Nah, haven't heard anything. What's it for?""
[Message 20] Dale: ""It's for small business owners. Supposedly, there will be some potential investors there.""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Ah, I see. Not really my thing. Construction work keeps me pretty busy.""
[Message 22] Dale: ""Fair enough. My friend Maria is going. She's trying to expand her catering business.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Good for her! Tell her I wish her luck.""
[Message 24] Dale: ""Will do. She's pretty nervous about pitching to potential investors.""
[Message 25] Alex: ""That's understandable. It can be intimidating. Maybe she should practice her presentation on you first.""
[Message 26] Dale: ""Good idea! I'll suggest that to her. Anyway, I should probably head out soon. Gotta get up early tomorrow.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Yeah, me too. Long day of hammering ahead of me.""
[Message 28] Dale: ""Have a good one, Alex!""
[Message 29] Alex: ""You too, Dale! See you tonight at Small Hours?""
[Message 30] Dale: ""Definitely! Around 8?""
[Message 31] Alex: ""Sounds good. Later!""
[Message 32] Dale: ""Later!""
[Message 33] Alex: ""So, anything else going on besides zoning and dog parks?""
[Message 34] Dale: ""Just the usual El Paso news. The Chihuahuas are still winning, which is good.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""That's always a plus. Keeps the city spirits up.""
[Message 36] Dale: ""True. And there's some discussion about expanding the streetcar route.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Oh really? Where are they thinking of extending it to?""
[Message 38] Dale: ""They're talking about going further west, towards UTEP.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""That would be convenient for the students. Parking is a nightmare around there.""
[Message 40] Dale: ""Exactly. But I'm sure there will be some opposition from residents along the proposed route.""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Always is. NIMBYism is alive and well in El Paso.""
[Message 42] Dale: ""Unfortunately. Hey, quick question. Do you know anyone who's good with computers?""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Depends on what you need. I know a couple of people who are pretty tech-savvy.""
[Message 44] Dale: ""My laptop is acting up. Keeps freezing and crashing. It's driving me crazy.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Ugh, that's the worst. Try restarting it first, that's the classic fix.""
[Message 46] Dale: ""Tried that a million times. Still no luck.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""Okay, then it might be something more serious. I can give you the number of a guy I know. He runs a computer repair shop.""
[Message 48] Dale: ""That would be amazing! Thanks, Alex.""
[Message 49] Alex: ""No problem. I'll text it to you later. He's a bit of a geek, but he knows his stuff.""
[Message 50] Dale: ""As long as he can fix my laptop, I don't care if he speaks Klingon.""
[Message 51] Alex: ""Haha! I'll let him know. He might actually appreciate that.""
[Message 52] Dale: ""So, back to the local news...anything else I should be aware of?""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Hmm, not that I can think of. Just the usual political squabbles and traffic jams.""
[Message 54] Dale: ""Sounds about right. El Paso, in a nutshell.""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Yep. Still love it though.""
[Message 56] Dale: ""Me too. It's home.""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Speaking of home, I need to run and grab some groceries before they close.""
[Message 58] Dale: ""Good idea. I should probably do the same. I'm starving.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""See you later at Small Hours then! And don't forget to practice your Pac-Man skills.""
[Message 60] Dale: ""Will do! Later, Alex!""
[Message 61] Alex: ""Later Dale!""
[Message 62] Dale: ""Hey Alex, just remembered something else from the city council meeting!""
[Message 63] Alex: ""Oh yeah? What's that?""
[Message 64] Dale: ""They're considering adding more public art installations downtown.""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Interesting! I'm all for that. More art is always a good thing.""
[Message 66] Dale: ""Me too. It can really brighten up a place.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""Hopefully, they'll choose some local artists. There's a lot of talent in El Paso.""
[Message 68] Dale: ""That's what I'm hoping for. It would be a great opportunity for them.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Definitely. Maybe we should try to get involved somehow, make some suggestions.""
[Message 70] Dale: ""That's a great idea! We could research some local artists and send them a list.""
[Message 71] Alex: ""Perfect! We can talk more about it tonight at Small Hours.""
[Message 72] Dale: ""Sounds like a plan. I'm looking forward to it.""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Me too. It's always good to brainstorm ideas together.""
[Message 74] Dale: ""Absolutely. Two heads are better than one.""
[Message 75] Alex: ""Especially when it comes to art.""
[Message 76] Dale: ""True! Hey, have you tried that new coffee shop on Cincinnati Street?""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Nope, haven't had a chance yet. Is it any good?""
[Message 78] Dale: ""It's amazing! They have the best lattes in town.""
[Message 79] Alex: ""Wow, high praise! I'll have to check it out sometime.""
[Message 80] Dale: ""You definitely should. They also have some delicious pastries.""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Okay, you've convinced me. I'll swing by tomorrow morning.""
[Message 82] Dale: ""Great! Let me know what you think.""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Will do. Thanks for the recommendation.""
[Message 84] Dale: ""No problem! Always happy to share good coffee.""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Well, I gotta run now. Groceries are calling my name.""
[Message 86] Dale: ""Alright. See you tonight!""
[Message 87] Alex: ""See ya!""
[Message 88] Dale: ""Oh, and one more thing about the networking event...""
[Message 89] Alex: ""Yeah?""
[Message 90] Dale: ""They're apparently having a karaoke night afterwards.""
[Message 91] Alex: ""Karaoke? Oh, I don't know about that.""
[Message 92] Dale: ""Come on, it could be fun! You might surprise yourself.""
[Message 93] Alex: ""I'm more of a spectator when it comes to karaoke. I'll leave the singing to you.""
[Message 94] Dale: ""Haha! Fair enough. But you might want to stick around. My singing might be...entertaining.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""I'm sure you'll be great! You have a good voice.""
[Message 96] Dale: ""Thanks! I appreciate that. I've been practicing my Adele.""
[Message 97] Alex: ""Adele? That's ambitious! Good luck with that.""
[Message 98] Dale: ""I need it! Anyway, just thought I'd give you a heads-up about the karaoke.""
[Message 99] Alex: ""Thanks for the warning. I'll bring earplugs, just in case.""
[Message 100] Dale: ""Hey! Rude! Just kidding. See you tonight!""
[Message 101] Alex: ""Haha! See ya!""
[Message 102] Dale: ""Just thinking about the networking event...what kind of construction work do you usually do, Alex?""
[Message 103] Alex: ""Mostly residential stuff. Remodeling, additions, that sort of thing.""
[Message 104] Dale: ""That's cool. El Paso is always growing, so I'm sure you're busy.""
[Message 105] Alex: ""Yeah, there's definitely no shortage of work. Especially with the new housing developments going up.""
[Message 106] Dale: ""True. It's changing the landscape of the city.""
[Message 107] Alex: ""For better or worse, I guess. Progress is inevitable.""
[Message 108] Dale: ""Yeah, that's true. It's hard to keep things the same.""
[Message 109] Alex: ""I miss some of the old El Paso, but I also appreciate the new developments.""
[Message 110] Dale: ""It's a balancing act, for sure. Trying to preserve the history while moving forward.""
[Message 111] Alex: ""Exactly. That's what makes El Paso unique.""
[Message 112] Dale: ""Definitely. It's a special place.""
[Message 113] Alex: ""Alright, I'm really off to the store now. My stomach is growling.""
[Message 114] Dale: ""Haha! Okay, go get some food! See you later.""
[Message 115] Alex: ""Later!""
[Message 116] Dale: ""Hey, Alex, before you go... one more thing about the news.""
[Message 117] Alex: ""Okay, shoot.""
[Message 118] Dale: ""They're talking about potentially raising property taxes next year.""
[Message 119] Alex: ""Ugh, that's never good. Everyone's going to be up in arms about that.""
[Message 120] Dale: ""Exactly! It's going to be a hot topic at the next city council meeting for sure.""
[Message 121] Alex: ""I can already imagine the protests. It's going to be a mess.""
[Message 122] Dale: ""Yep. Just wanted to give you a heads up so you're not completely blindsided.""
[Message 123] Alex: ""Appreciate it, Dale. That's definitely something to keep an eye on.""
[Message 124] Dale: ""For sure. It could affect everyone.""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Especially homeowners. And renters, indirectly.""
[Message 126] Dale: ""Yep. Alright, NOW I'm done. Go get those groceries!""
[Message 127] Alex: ""Haha! Okay, okay! I'm going! See ya!""
[Message 128] Dale: ""Bye!""
[Message 129] Alex: ""One more thing... Small Hours has good deals during happy hour. ""
[Message 130] Dale: ""Thanks for the tip! I'll get there early then.""
[Message 131] Alex: ""Smart move. Less crowded too.""
[Message 132] Dale: ""Perfect. Now, go!""
[Message 133] Alex: ""Haha! I'm going, I'm going! Seriously this time.""
[Message 134] Dale: ""Good. I'm going to start practicing my Adele.""

[Message 136] Dale: ""I won't! See ya!""
[Message 137] Alex: ""See ya!""
[Message 138] Dale: ""Okay, I'm officially done talking now. Goodbye forever!""
[Message 139] Alex: ""Don't be dramatic! We'll see each other in a few hours.""

[Message 4] MAYA: Ugh, traffic is gonna be a nightmare now.

[Message 5] JASPER: Foreal, Maya. Anyway, Chloe, did you ever get that concert ticket?

[Message 6] CHLOE: No, sold out :(

[Message 7] LIAM: David Miller. Seemed like a good guy. What happened?

[Message 8] MAYA: Car accident, Liam. Tragic.

[Message 9] KIRA: I think I saw something! Yesterday, Mid-Morning, I was getting coffee near there. Saw someone speeding away... kinda bushy eyebrows if I remember right?

[Message 10] JASPER: Kira, you always see stuff. LOL

[Message 11] KIRA: Shut up, Jasper! It's true! I think it was a dark SUV.

[Message 12] LIAM: A dark SUV, huh? That's… specific.

[Message 13] CHLOE: Maybe you should tell the police, Kira.

[Message 14] KIRA: I might. Just trying to remember details. Was pretty chaotic.

[Message 15] MAYA: Speaking of chaotic, anyone wanna grab pizza later?

[Message 16] LIAM: Pizza sounds good. I’m in.

[Message 17] JASPER: Me too.

[Message 18] CHLOE: Can't, got a late shift.

[Message 21] MAYA: Kira, don't go all conspiracy theorist on us.

[Message 22] JASPER: Yeah, chill Kira.

[Message 23] KIRA: I'm just saying! He was making noise. I saw him leave the building at Mid-Morning.

[Message 24] LIAM: Making noise how? Protests?

[Message 25] KIRA: Yeah, stuff like that. Some people didn’t like it.

[Message 26] MAYA: Who cares what people think. Someone got in an accident.

[Message 27] JASPER: Chill Maya

[Message 28] KIRA: I thought I saw Axel around there that day too.

[Message 29] LIAM: Axel? You sure?

[Message 30] KIRA: Pretty sure. Maybe earlier in the morning.

[Message 31] MAYA: Why do you even care?

[Message 32] KIRA: Because Axel always hated activists.

[Message 33] JASPER: Axel is harmless.

[Message 34] LIAM: Hold up. I heard Dana used to be a witness.

[Message 35] KIRA: What did Dana witness?

[Message 36] MAYA: Witness to what?

[Message 37] JASPER: What's that gotta do with anything?

[Message 38] LIAM: Something shady. Maybe she wanted to get rid of him because he knew something.

[Message 39] KIRA: Wait, is Dana the one with the lip piercing?

[Message 40] MAYA: Yeah. Why?

[Message 41] KIRA: No reason, just thinking.

[Message 48] LIAM: A friend who works at the airport.

[Message 49] KIRA: Did the friend see if Axel and Dana where together?

[Message 50] LIAM: They didn’t specify.

[Message 51] MAYA: It's a big airport. People are there all the time.

[Message 10] Sam: ""That's him! But his own books are even better. Mistborn is a great starting point.""

[Message 16] Sam: ""Plus, they look great on a shelf! What about you? Ebooks or physical?""
[Message 17] Alex: ""I'm mostly ebooks these days. Easier to carry around when I'm at the garage. Less likely to get grease on them, haha!""

582,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey! Just wanted to say thanks again for helping me with that presentation yesterday.
[Message 2] River: No problem, Alex! Happy to help. How did it go?
[Message 3] Alex: It went really well, actually. Better than expected! I was dreading it.
[Message 4] River: That's awesome! See, all that preparation paid off.
[Message 5] Alex: True, but your input was invaluable. Seriously.
[Message 6] River: Glad I could contribute. So, anything exciting happening today?
[Message 7] Alex: Just the usual grind. Another team meeting this afternoon.
[Message 8] River: Ugh, team meetings. The bane of my existence.
[Message 9] Alex: Tell me about it. Usually a lot of talk and little action.
[Message 10] River: Exactly! What's on the agenda this time?
[Message 11] Alex: Apparently, it's a ""gratitude circle"" to boost morale.
[Message 12] River: A gratitude circle? Seriously? That sounds…forced.
[Message 13] Alex: My thoughts exactly. I'm already dreading it more than the presentation.
[Message 14] River: I can imagine! Maybe you can subtly suggest doing something more practical next time.
[Message 15] Alex: I might try. Though I doubt it'll make a difference. They're pretty set in their ways.
[Message 16] River: Worth a shot, right? Speaking of…have you seen the Grizzlies play lately?
[Message 17] Alex: Grizzlies? Nah, not really into sports. I prefer volunteering at the animal shelter.
[Message 18] River: Ah, that's cool! I'm trying to catch a game this week. Ja Morant is on fire.
[Message 19] Alex: Volunteering is definitely more my speed. It actually makes a tangible difference, you know?
[Message 20] River: I get that. I just find sports a good way to de-stress. A different kind of ""gratitude,"" I guess.
[Message 21] Alex: Haha, fair enough. Each to their own.
[Message 22] River: So, what are you grateful for today, heading into that gratitude circle?
[Message 23] Alex: Hmm... that I have a job, I suppose. Even if it involves forced gratitude exercises.
[Message 24] River: Haha, very practical. I'm grateful for sunshine! It's been so gloomy lately.
[Message 25] Alex: Good point! Sunshine is definitely a mood booster.
[Message 26] River: It is! Makes even the thought of facing a Monday less terrible.
[Message 27] Alex: True, though Monday is still Monday.
[Message 28] River: Don't I know it. What time is your meeting?
[Message 29] Alex: 2 PM. So, I have a little bit of time to mentally prepare myself for the onslaught of positivity.
[Message 30] River: Send me a mental update! Let me know how cringey it gets.
[Message 31] Alex: Will do. I anticipate maximum cringe levels.
[Message 32] River: I'm placing bets on someone crying happy tears.
[Message 33] Alex: Highly likely. Or someone sharing a deeply personal, TMI story.
[Message 34] River: Oh god, yeah. That's even worse.
[Message 35] Alex: Exactly. I'll need a strong coffee to get through it.
[Message 36] River: Definitely! Maybe two.
[Message 37] Alex: Thinking about it, I'm actually grateful for coffee. It gets me through the day.
[Message 38] River: A universally appreciated form of gratitude!
[Message 39] Alex: Agreed. I should probably go grab one now, before the meeting.
[Message 40] River: Good idea! Fortify yourself.
[Message 41] Alex: Will do. Talk to you later, and I'll give you the meeting rundown.
[Message 42] River: Sounds good! Good luck surviving.
[Message 43] Alex: Thanks! I'll need it.
[Message 44] River: By the way, did you see that new travel agency opened up downtown?
[Message 45] Alex: Oh really? I hadn't noticed. Near where?
[Message 46] River: Yeah, it's on Main Street, right next to the bookstore.
[Message 47] Alex: Oh, okay. Might check it out sometime. I need a vacation.
[Message 48] River: Me too! Somewhere sunny and far away.
[Message 49] Alex: Agreed. Preferably with no mandatory gratitude circles.
[Message 50] River: Hahaha! Definitely no mandatory gratitude circles.
[Message 51] Alex: Okay, gotta run. Coffee and then the dreaded meeting awaits.
[Message 52] River: Go get 'em! Or at least survive them.
[Message 53] Alex: Will do my best. Later!
[Message 54] River: Later! Let me know if you need a post-meeting debrief session.
[Message 55] Alex: Definitely taking you up on that.
[Message 56] River: Anytime! It's the least I can do.
[Message 57] Alex: Appreciate it!
[Message 58] River: So, what are your vacation plans looking like?
[Message 59] Alex: I have no idea. But, I'm thinking something tropical. Maybe the Bahamas?
[Message 60] River: Ooo, the Bahamas sounds amazing! I was thinking maybe Hawaii.
[Message 61] Alex: Hawaii would be great too! Somewhere with a beach and good food.
[Message 62] River: Exactly! And no work emails.
[Message 63] Alex: Yes, definitely no work emails. That's non-negotiable.
[Message 64] River: Agreed. Maybe that travel agency can help us plan something amazing!
[Message 65] Alex: Maybe! I'll keep it in mind. Thanks!",0,

[Message 9] Sam: ""I just knew him from grabbing coffee. Seemed optimistic.""
[Message 10] Leo: ""He owed me money. Nothing major, like twenty bucks for poker.""
[Message 11] Riley: ""Poker? David? Seriously?""
[Message 12] Leo: ""Yeah, we played every Tuesday. I'm owed 20 bucks.""
[Message 13] Sam: ""I'm going to miss him.""
[Message 14] Kai: ""Miss him? You barely knew him, Sam.""
[Message 15] Sam: ""Still. It's sad. Someone's life is over.""

[Message 27] Riley: ""Vanessa? No. Why?""
[Message 28] Leo: ""Just wondering. Heard she was pissed at him recently.""

[Message 35] Sam: ""That's kind of morbid, Kai. Why do you ask?""
[Message 36] Kai: ""Just curious. Maybe it was something political. David was always talking about change.""
[Message 37] Riley: ""Political? David? He was a manager.""
[Message 38] Kai: ""Doesn't mean he didn't have opinions.""
[Message 39] Sam: ""Maybe it was the roof access ladder.""
[Message 40] Leo: ""Roof access ladder? You think someone pushed it off?"" *Actus Reus*

[Message 48] Leo: ""Accident? You don't think it was an accident, do you? I saw Vanessa heading in that direction that night."" *Actus Reus*
[Message 49] Kai: ""Vanessa? Why would she…?""
[Message 50] Leo: ""Remember that time David fired her from the register? If he hadn't fired her, none of this would have happened."" *Causation*
[Message 51] Kai: ""That was ages ago.""
[Message 52] Leo: ""People hold grudges.""
[Message 53] Sam: ""Hey guys, just heard from a friend who works at the hospital. They said David was already hurt pretty bad when someone found him. They think he may have been alive for a little while. It makes me wonder if calling 911 sooner would have changed things."" *Causation*
[Message 54] Kai: ""Damn. That's rough.""
[Message 55] Leo: ""So, like, what do you think is going to happen to who did it.""
[Message 56] Kai: ""Well, if it was murder, someone is going away for a long time. That much is obvious."" *Punishment*
[Message 57] Sam: ""Think they'll find the person responsible?""
[Message 58] Kai: ""Stockton PD ain't exactly Sherlock Holmes, but maybe.""
[Message 59] Leo: ""I saw Tyler lurking around the library right before it happened."" *Actus Reus*
[Message 60] Sam: ""Tyler? Why would he be there?""
[Message 61] Leo: ""He always hated David. Said David was ruining the neighborhood with his… activities."" *Mens Rea*

[Message 64] Riley: ""Okay, I'm back. Just saw online they're saying it was a deliberate act.""
[Message 65] Sam: ""Deliberate? Someone did it on purpose?""
[Message 66] Riley: ""That's what they're reporting. Police are investigating it as a homicide.""
[Message 67] Kai: ""So, not an accident.""
[Message 68] Leo: ""Told you.""

[Message 70] Riley: ""I heard that Tyler was looking up how to make Falling object (dropped from height) online."" *Attempt*
[Message 71] Leo: ""See! Tyler!""
[Message 72] Kai: ""Looking up? That's a bit much.""
[Message 73] Sam: ""I still find it hard to believe Tyler would do something like this.""
[Message 74] Riley: ""Me too. I feel like this is going to make things worse.""
[Message 75] Leo: ""Vanessa tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't listen."" *Attempt*

[Message 4] Liam: ""Apparently, a hit and run. Alex died. Really messed up.""
[Message 5] Chloe: ""So terrible! I drove past there this Late Afternoon, but didn't see anything unusual.""
[Message 6] Kai: ""Wow. That's heavy. Do they know who did it?""
[Message 7] Liam: ""No clue yet. Cops are investigating. Someone should pay for this. Maybe they'll go away for a long time for this.""
[Message 8] Chloe: ""I hope they catch the person. Alex was always so carefree. Remember that time when Alex saved a cat from a tree.""
[Message 9] Kai: ""Yeah, catch is only part of it. Justice should be served swiftly and surely.""
[Message 10] Liam: ""Right! I saw River near there. River always hated Alex. Thought Alex was undercutting River.""
[Message 11] Chloe: ""River? Seriously? River wouldn't do something like that, would she?""
[Message 12] Kai: ""I don’t know River that well, but Liam does have a point. What was River doing there?""
[Message 13] Liam: ""I don't know for sure. I just saw a large hands figured leave there at Late Afternoon. It's a rough coincidence.""
[Message 14] Chloe: ""That's quite a coincidence! I was buying Car accident (vehicular homicide) at the store, for my niece's birthday. I was thinking about buying Alex a new toy. :( ""
[Message 15] Kai: ""Whoa, hold on. Let's not jump to conclusions about River. She can be a bit abrasive, but River is harmless.""
[Message 16] Liam: ""I’m just saying what I saw. Plus, River was furious when Alex got that big contract, she wanted to get rid of Alex.""
[Message 17] Chloe: ""I still can't believe it. Alex didn't deserve this. Remember when Alex helped us move? Such a kind soul.""

[Message 10] Taylor: I'd be down for that! What about next weekend?
[Message 11] Alex: I'm free next weekend. What are we thinking, board games and snacks?
[Message 12] Riley: Sounds perfect! We could even try a new one.
[Message 13] Jordan: I'm in! I can bring some snacks. What kind does everyone like?
[Message 14] Casey: Anything savory for me! Chips, pretzels, that kind of thing.

[Message 35] Taylor: Perfect! We'll have a whole roster of games to choose from.
[Message 36] Alex: This is going to be a blast.
[Message 37] Riley: Definitely! Maybe we can even do this regularly.
[Message 38] Jordan: I'd be up for that!
[Message 39] Casey: Me too! It's a great way to relax and unwind.
[Message 40] Taylor: Absolutely! And it's a good excuse to eat junk food.
[Message 41] Alex: Don't forget the company! Good times with good people.
[Message 42] Riley: Exactly!
[Message 43] Jordan: So, Komodo dragon now, then maybe the gorillas?
[Message 44] Casey: Sounds like a plan!
[Message 45] Taylor: Let's do it!
[Message 46] Alex: Gorillas are always entertaining.
[Message 47] Riley: They are! Especially when they start playing around.
[Message 48] Jordan: I love watching them interact.
[Message 49] Casey: It's like watching a soap opera.
[Message 50] Taylor: Haha, so true!
[Message 51] Alex: Has anyone read any good books lately? Switching gears a bit.
[Message 52] Riley: Oh, I just finished ""Project Hail Mary"" by Andy Weir. Highly recommend.
[Message 53] Jordan: Andy Weir is great! I loved ""The Martian.""
[Message 54] Casey: I'm currently reading ""Where the Crawdads Sing."" It's pretty good.
[Message 55] Taylor: I've heard of that one! Is it as sad as everyone says?
[Message 56] Alex: It is pretty emotional, but also beautifully written.
[Message 57] Riley: I'll add it to my list.
[Message 58] Jordan: Me too. Always looking for new book recommendations.
[Message 59] Casey: I can lend it to you when I'm done.
[Message 60] Taylor: That would be awesome! Thanks!
[Message 61] Alex: This reminds me, we should start a book club!
[Message 62] Riley: That's a great idea!
[Message 63] Jordan: I'm in! We could even meet at the zoo sometimes.
[Message 64] Casey: That's a fun idea! We could read books related to animals or nature.
[Message 65] Taylor: I love that!
[Message 66] Alex: Okay, so book club is also officially a thing!
[Message 67] Riley: What should our first book be?
[Message 68] Jordan: ""Where the Crawdads Sing,"" since Casey is reading it already?
[Message 69] Casey: Sounds good to me!
[Message 70] Taylor: Perfect!
[Message 71] Alex: All right, ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" it is!
[Message 72] Riley: I'll grab a copy ASAP.
[Message 73] Jordan: Me too.
[Message 74] Casey: Let me know when you've both finished, and we can discuss it.
[Message 75] Taylor: Will do!
[Message 76] Alex: Looking forward to it!
[Message 77] Riley: Okay, Komodo dragon, gorillas, then book club discussion sometime in the future. We're productive today!
[Message 78] Jordan: Haha, yes we are!
[Message 79] Casey: Definitely making the most of our zoo visit.
[Message 80] Taylor: I'm starving, though. What time is lunch?
[Message 81] Alex: It’s noon right now.
[Message 82] Riley: We could grab something at the zoo cafe.
[Message 83] Jordan: Or pack a picnic next time.
[Message 84] Casey: Good idea! The zoo cafe is usually overpriced.
[Message 85] Taylor: True. Let's just grab something quick today.
[Message 86] Alex: Sounds like a plan. Cafe it is.
[Message 87] Riley: Alright, after the gorillas?
[Message 88] Jordan: Sounds good to me.
[Message 89] Casey: Perfect.
[Message 90] Taylor: Lead the way!
[Message 91] Alex: Anyone else into video games at all?
[Message 92] Riley: I play occasionally. Mostly Nintendo Switch.
[Message 93] Jordan: I used to play a lot more, but not so much anymore.
[Message 94] Casey: I'm more of a board game person myself.
[Message 95] Taylor: I'm a big gamer! PC mostly.
[Message 96] Alex: What kind of games do you play, Taylor?
[Message 97] Riley: Yeah, spill the beans!
[Message 98] Jordan: We're curious!
[Message 99] Casey: Tell us everything!
[Message 100] Taylor: RPGs mostly. Stuff like Skyrim, Fallout, that kind of thing.
[Message 101] Alex: Ah, a fellow RPG enthusiast!
[Message 102] Riley: I've heard good things about Skyrim.
[Message 103] Jordan: Classic!
[Message 104] Casey: I'm impressed!
[Message 105] Taylor: They're great! I highly recommend them.
[Message 106] Alex: Maybe we can compare notes sometime.
[Message 107] Riley: That would be cool!
[Message 108] Jordan: Definitely!
[Message 109] Casey: Always good to expand our horizons.
[Message 110] Taylor: Absolutely!
[Message 111] Alex: Well, this has been a lovely day so far.
[Message 112] Riley: It has! Thanks for suggesting the zoo, Alex!
[Message 113] Jordan: Yeah, great choice!
[Message 114] Casey: Definitely a fun way to spend a Saturday.
[Message 115] Taylor: Agreed!
[Message 116] Alex: My pleasure, everyone!
[Message 117] Riley: Okay, gorillas, then lunch!
[Message 118] Jordan: Onward!
[Message 119] Casey: Let's go!
[Message 120] Taylor: I'm ready for some monkeys!
[Message 121] Alex: Monkeys are great, but they aren’t Gorillas.
[Message 122] Riley: True, but the lemurs are cute too.
[Message 123] Jordan: Another exhibit for another day!
[Message 124] Casey: Lots to see here!

[Message 14] Jamie: Be patient, Alex. And listen more than you talk.
[Message 15] River: Definitely listen. And don't be afraid to admit you don't know something. It builds trust.
[Message 16] Alex: Good points, both of you. Thanks. Patience is not my strong suit, haha.
[Message 17] Jamie: We know, Alex! Haha. Seriously though, remember what it was like when you started.
[Message 18] River: Yeah, empathy is key. And celebrate the small wins!
[Message 19] Alex: Okay, empathy and small wins. Got it. Back to the bathroom… any recommendations for grout?
[Message 20] Jamie: Epoxy grout! More expensive, but worth it. Doesn't stain as easily.
[Message 21] River: I agree with Jamie. Epoxy grout is the way to go. Less maintenance.
[Message 22] Alex: Alright, epoxy grout it is. You guys are saving me so much headache.
[Message 23] Jamie: That's what friends are for! I'm just hoping my ferns survive this weekend. Watering them is a full-time job.
[Message 24] River: Ferns are drama queens. Try misting them in the evening. Seems to help.
[Message 25] Alex: Speaking of plants, I saw the craziest cactus the other day. Looked like something out of a Dr. Seuss book.
[Message 26] Jamie: Phoenix has some incredible cacti. We should go to the Desert Botanical Garden sometime.
[Message 27] River: Ooh, yes! I've been meaning to go back. It's been ages.
[Message 28] Alex: Let's plan that. Maybe next weekend?
[Message 29] Jamie: Sounds good! I'm free next Saturday.
[Message 30] River: Saturday works for me too!
[Message 31] Alex: Awesome! Saturday it is. Now, back to my doomed bathroom... I'm also thinking of changing the vanity.
[Message 32] Jamie: That's a bigger job! Are you sure you're up for it?
[Message 33] River: Yeah, vanity replacement can be tricky. Plumbing and all that.
[Message 34] Alex: I'm gonna watch some YouTube tutorials. I'm pretty handy, I think. Famous last words, right?
[Message 35] Jamie: YouTube is your friend! Just be careful with the plumbing. Turn off the water!
[Message 36] River: Definitely turn off the water! And have a bucket handy. Trust me.
[Message 37] Alex: Bucket, check. YouTube, check. Determination… somewhat check.
[Message 38] Jamie: Haha! You got this, Alex. Just take your time.
[Message 39] River: And don't be afraid to call a professional if you get stuck! No shame in that.
[Message 40] Alex: True, true. My pride might take a hit, but better than flooding the house.
[Message 41] Jamie: Exactly! I'm going to start binging a new show tonight. Anything good on TV?
[Message 42] River: I heard ""Ted Lasso"" is amazing. I haven't started it yet, though.
[Message 43] Alex: I'm still hooked on that cooking competition show. Can't remember the name... but it's addictive.
[Message 44] Jamie: Is it ""The Great British Baking Show""?
[Message 45] Alex: That's the one! I love it.
[Message 46] River: ""The Great British Baking Show"" is so wholesome. I love it too!
[Message 47] Alex: Makes me want to bake, even though I usually just burn things.
[Message 48] Jamie: Haha! Maybe stick to the bathroom remodel for now.
[Message 49] River: Good point! One project at a time.
[Message 50] Alex: You guys are right. Okay, bathroom this weekend, baking another time.
[Message 51] Jamie: Sounds like a plan! Enjoy the sunset, everyone.
[Message 52] River: You too, Jamie! This was a lovely chat.
[Message 53] Alex: Yeah, thanks for the advice, guys. I feel much more prepared... or at least, less terrified.
[Message 54] Jamie: Anytime, Alex! Let us know how it goes. And send pictures!
[Message 55] River: Yes, pictures! We need to see the progress (and any potential disasters).
[Message 56] Alex: Will do! Expect photographic evidence of my triumph... or my complete and utter failure.
[Message 57] Jamie: We'll be cheering you on either way!
[Message 58] River: Absolutely! Good luck, Alex!
[Message 59] Alex: Thanks again, you two! Gotta head out. Have a great evening!
[Message 60] Jamie: You too, Alex! Bye",0,

[Message 8] Charles: ""That's a nice thought. What kind of achievements are we talking about?""
[Message 9] Emily: ""Yeah, Sophia, elaborate! Did you catch the bouquet?""
[Message 10] Sophia: ""Haha, no bouquet for me. But seriously, it got me thinking about things I'm proud of. Like finally finishing my master's degree last year.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""That's awesome, Sophia! Congrats again. Always admired your dedication.""
[Message 12] David: ""Impressive! I remember you talking about juggling work and study. Huge achievement.""
[Message 13] Charles: ""Absolutely. For me, it was getting my pharmacy license. Felt like climbing a mountain.""
[Message 14] Emily: ""Oh, I can imagine, Charles. Lots of studying involved!""
[Message 15] Alex: ""Speaking of mountains, David, how's the camping trip planning coming along?""
[Message 16] David: ""Good, good! Still gathering gear. Hoping to go next month if the weather cooperates.""
[Message 17] Sophia: ""Camping? Sounds intense. I prefer a good book and a comfy couch.""
[Message 18] Emily: ""Me too, Sophia! Total introvert here. My biggest achievement is probably keeping my houseplants alive.""
[Message 19] Charles: ""Haha, Emily, that's a valid achievement! It takes dedication.""
[Message 20] Alex: ""Seriously! My succulents die on me constantly. I'm impressed.""
[Message 21] David: ""I'll give you some camping tips, Sophia, maybe convert you! It's really peaceful.""
[Message 22] Sophia: ""I appreciate the offer, David, but I think I'll pass. I'm more of a hotel kinda gal.""
[Message 23] Charles: ""What about you, Alex? Any recent achievements you're proud of?""
[Message 24] Alex: ""Well, I finally managed to pay off my credit card debt. Felt amazing.""
[Message 25] Emily: ""Whoa, that's a huge accomplishment! Congrats, Alex!""
[Message 26] David: ""Serious achievement! Financial freedom is the best freedom.""
[Message 27] Sophia: ""Definitely! I'm still working on that one. Any tips, Alex?""
[Message 28] Alex: ""Budgeting, Sophia, budgeting! And resisting impulse buys. Hard, but worth it.""
[Message 29] Charles: ""Very true. Discipline is key.""
[Message 30] Emily: ""Okay, speaking of achievements, I finally learned to play that song on the ukulele! Only took me six months.""
[Message 31] David: ""Nice! You should give us a performance sometime.""
[Message 32] Sophia: ""That's so cool, Emily! I've always wanted to learn an instrument.""
[Message 33] Charles: ""Music is a great way to relax. What song was it?""
[Message 34] Emily: ""It's a simple Hawaiian tune. Very chill.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""I attempted guitar once. Didn't go well.""

[Message 51] Sophia: ""Okay, I'm going to try that today. Thanks for the tip.""

[Message 26] Arthur: ""Absolutely not. This hotel lobby is not designed for quiet contemplation.""
[Message 27] Dale: ""I'm starting to think this whole thing was a ploy to sell more overpriced hotel drinks.""
[Message 28] Arthur: ""That wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. Did you indulge?""
[Message 29] Dale: ""One watered-down gin and tonic. At $15 a pop. Highway robbery, I tell you.""
[Message 30] Arthur: ""Outrageous. I stuck to tap water. The only free thing there.""
[Message 31] Dale: ""Good call. So, what are you up to tomorrow? Any exciting plans?""
[Message 32] Arthur: ""Thinking of going for a hike. Need to clear my head after that... ordeal.""
[Message 33] Dale: ""Nice! Where are you planning to go?""
[Message 34] Arthur: ""Probably Liberty State Park. It's close and offers some decent trails.""
[Message 35] Dale: ""Ah, good choice. I might do some traveling next week, trying to nail down this deal.""
[Message 36] Arthur: ""Where to this time, globetrotter?""
[Message 37] Dale: ""Thinking about heading to Chicago. Never been, believe it or not.""
[Message 38] Arthur: ""Chicago is great! You should definitely check out the architecture boat tour.""
[Message 39] Dale: ""Thanks for the tip! I will. Back to the networking event... did you notice the lighting? Way too dim.""
[Message 40] Arthur: ""Yes! I felt like I was in a dimly lit cave, not a professional setting.""
[Message 41] Dale: ""Exactly! And the music? Some weird elevator jazz. Ugh.""
[Message 42] Arthur: ""They really missed the mark on every single aspect, didn't they?""
[Message 43] Dale: ""It certainly seems that way. I'm starting to feel bad for the organizers. Maybe they're new at this?""
[Message 44] Arthur: ""Perhaps. Or maybe they just don't care. Either way, I won't be attending their next event.""
[Message 45] Dale: ""Me neither. I think I'll stick to smaller, more focused gatherings in the future.""
[Message 46] Arthur: ""Agreed. Quality over quantity, Dale. Quality over quantity.""
[Message 47] Dale: ""Absolutely. I'm starting to feel tired. Maybe we should call it a night?""
[Message 48] Arthur: ""Good idea. My ears are still ringing. I need some silence.""
[Message 49] Dale: ""Mine too. It's amazing how draining a poorly organized event can be.""
[Message 50] Arthur: ""Indeed. Well, goodnight, Dale. Hopefully, tomorrow will be a better day.""
[Message 51] Dale: ""Goodnight, Arthur. Sleep well! And try to forget about the neon green suit.""
[Message 52] Arthur: ""I'll do my best. Though I suspect it will haunt my dreams.""
[Message 53] Dale: ""Haha! See you around.""
[Message 54] Arthur: ""Take care.""
[Message 55] Dale: ""Hey Arthur, one more thing I forgot to complain about!""
[Message 56] Arthur: ""Oh dear, what now?""
[Message 57] Dale: ""The valet parking! Charged me an arm and a leg.""
[Message 58] Arthur: ""Ah, yes. Another classic hotel money-grab.""
[Message 59] Dale: ""I should have just parked down the street. Lesson learned.""
[Message 60] Arthur: ""Always a cheaper option, in retrospect. Live and learn.""
[Message 61] Dale: ""Exactly. Okay, *now* goodnight!""
[Message 62] Arthur: ""Goodnight for real this time.""
[Message 63] Dale: ""Night!""
[Message 64] Arthur: ""...""
[Message 65] Dale: ""Arthur?""
[Message 66] Arthur: ""Sorry, just thinking about the hike tomorrow. So much better than that networking event.""
[Message 67] Dale: ""Definitely. Fresh air and nature... beats neon green suits any day.""
[Message 68] Arthur: ""Couldn't agree more. Did you pack your things after we went to the event?""
[Message 69] Dale: ""Almost done. Just a few toiletries to throw in.""
[Message 70] Arthur: ""Smart. I should probably do the same. Procrastination is my downfall.""
[Message 71] Dale: ""We all have our vices. Mine is buying too many souvenirs when I travel.""
[Message 72] Arthur: ""Haha! I can relate. I always end up with more hiking gear than I need.""
[Message 73] Dale: ""I saw a really odd looking hat at the event. It was bright orange and fluffy. Not sure what purpose it served.""
[Message 74] Arthur: ""Oh, I think I saw that. It looked like something a cartoon character would wear.""
[Message 75] Dale: ""Precisely! The whole event was a cartoon in itself, really.""
[Message 76] Arthur: ""A poorly drawn cartoon, at that.""
[Message 77] Dale: ""Agreed. Well, I'm off to pack. Promise, no more complaints... tonight!""
[Message 78] Arthur: ""Alright, alright. Goodnight again!""
[Message 79] Dale: ""Night!""
[Message 80] Arthur: ""...""
[Message 81] Dale: ""Arthur, you still awake? This is getting ridiculous.""
[Message 82] Arthur: ""Sorry, Dale. Just remembered something else. The Wi-Fi was terrible!""
[Message 83] Dale: ""Oh, you're right! I tried to check my emails and it was a disaster.""
[Message 84] Arthur: ""Impossible to get a signal. Unacceptable in this day and age.""
[Message 85] Dale: ""Completely agree. Especially at a *networking* event. How are you supposed to connect without internet access?""
[Message 86] Arthur: ""Exactly! It's like they're actively trying to sabotage their own event.""
[Message 87] Dale: ""I think you might be right. Okay, I'm officially done complaining now. Goodnight!""
[Message 88] Arthur: ""Goodnight, Dale! I mean it this time!""
[Message 89] Dale: ""Haha! Night!""
[Message 90] Arthur: ""...""
[Message 91] Dale: ""Seriously, Arthur?""
[Message 92] Arthur: ""What? I was just checking the weather for my hike tomorrow.""
[Message 93] Dale: ""That's allowed. Just no more complaints about the networking event. Please.""
[Message 94] Arthur: ""Deal. The weather looks promising, by the way. Sunny with a slight breeze.""
[Message 95] Dale: ""Perfect hiking weather! Enjoy it.""
[Message 96] Arthur: ""I will. Thanks! And good luck in Chicago.""
[Message 97] Dale: ""Thanks! I'm actually kind of looking forward to it, despite my travel weariness.""
[Message 98] Arthur: ""A change of scenery can do wonders. Plus, deep-dish pizza!""
[Message 99] Dale: ""Oh, I'm definitely planning on trying that. I've heard so much about it.""
[Message 100] Arthur: ""It's an experience. Be prepared for a food coma afterwards.""
[Message 101] Dale: ""Noted! I'll pace myself. Maybe. Okay, I'm really going now. Night!""
[Message 102] Arthur: ""Okay, Dale! Safe travels, whenever that is.""
[Message 103] Dale: ""Thanks! Goodnight!""
[Message 104] Arthur: ""Night!""
[Message 105] Dale: ""...""
[Message 106] Arthur: ""Dale?""
[Message 107] Dale: ""Are you kidding me, Arthur?""
[Message 108] Arthur: ""Sorry, sorry! I was just thinking... did you see what kind of shoes the event staff were wearing?""
[Message 109] Dale: ""This is a test, right? I'm failing this test. Please, Arthur, no more!""
[Message 110] Arthur: ""Okay, okay, no more! I promise! Just... I can't help but analyze everything.""
[Message 111] Dale: ""I understand. But for the sake of my sanity, let's analyze it tomorrow. In the morning. After a good night's sleep.""
[Message 112] Arthur: ""Fair enough. Goodnight, Dale. For real this time.""
[Message 113] Dale: ""Goodnight, Arthur. Sweet dreams! (Hopefully not about neon green suits or bad Wi-Fi)""
[Message 114] Arthur: ""I'll try my best. Goodnight!""
[Message 115] Dale: ""Night!""
[Message 116] Arthur: ""...""
[Message 117] Dale: ""Arthur, I swear...""
[Message 118] Arthur: ""Haha! Just kidding! Goodnight!""

599,"[Message 1] Alex: ""Morning, Beth! Did you see that article about the new park they're planning near Old Town?""
[Message 2] Beth: ""Alex! Good morning to you too. No, I haven't. I've been buried in spreadsheets all week. A new park, eh? Where exactly?""
[Message 3] Alex: ""It's supposed to be on that empty lot near Camelback Road. They're saying it'll have a dog park and a splash pad.""
[Message 4] Beth: ""Oh, that's interesting. That lot's been empty for ages. A dog park would be great for the neighborhood.""
[Message 5] Alex: ""That's what I thought! My old buddy, Sparky, would’ve loved it, though he’s not around anymore.""
[Message 6] Beth: ""Aww, I'm sorry to hear that, Alex. Dogs are the best. But that park sounds promising.""
[Message 7] Alex: ""Indeed. They’re also talking about adding some community garden plots.""
[Message 8] Beth: ""A garden too? That's ambitious. Who's funding all this?""
[Message 9] Alex: ""Apparently, a mix of city funds and private donations. The article mentioned something about a local foundation.""
[Message 10] Beth: ""Hmm, I'll have to look into that. Always good to know where the money's coming from.""
[Message 11] Alex: ""You and your data analyst brain! Always digging deeper. I like it!""
[Message 12] Beth: ""Someone has to keep these things honest, right? Besides, I might be able to volunteer my time helping with the fundraising if it's a good cause.""
[Message 13] Alex: ""You volunteering? I wouldn't have pictured that!""
[Message 14] Beth: ""Hey, I have hidden depths, my friend! I'm more than just numbers.""
[Message 15] Alex: ""I believe it. You’ve always surprised me. What else is new?""
[Message 16] Beth: ""Not much on my end. Still trying to finish that short story I've been working on for months.""
[Message 17] Alex: ""Ah, the writing! How's that going?""
[Message 18] Beth: ""Slowly. Writer's block is a real thing, unfortunately.""
[Message 19] Alex: ""I can imagine. Putting words together can be tough.""
[Message 20] Beth: ""Tell me about it. So, anything else interesting happening in your world, Alex?""
[Message 21] Alex: ""Well, they finally started repaving that stretch of Shea Boulevard. It was a nightmare driving on that thing.""
[Message 22] Beth: ""Oh, thank goodness! I avoid Shea like the plague because of that. It rattled my teeth every time I drove on it.""
[Message 23] Alex: ""Same here. My truck was taking a beating. Speaking of vehicles, have you considered upgrading yours lately?""
[Message 24] Beth: ""Actually, I have! Been eyeing a hybrid. Any recommendations?""
[Message 25] Alex: ""Hybrids are good, fuel-efficient. Though if you want power, nothing beats a good old V8, like in my truck.""
[Message 26] Beth: ""Ha! Power isn't really my thing. I'm more about reducing my carbon footprint.""
[Message 27] Alex: ""Fair enough. To each their own, eh? So, that park… they need volunteers, you think?""
[Message 28] Beth: ""Probably! I'll check out the city's website later and see if there's any info.""
[Message 29] Alex: ""Good thinking. Let me know if you find anything.""
[Message 30] Beth: ""Will do. What about you? Planning on lending a hand?""
[Message 31] Alex: ""I'm always up for some physical labor. Good for the soul. And the back, apparently.""
[Message 32] Beth: ""Haha, I hear you. Construction work can be tough on the body.""
[Message 33] Alex: ""It is, but it keeps me young...ish.""
[Message 34] Beth: ""You certainly don't look your age, Alex. Must be all that fresh air and sunshine.""
[Message 35] Alex: ""That and avoiding spreadsheets! So, the park’s groundbreaking is next month, I heard.""
[Message 36] Beth: ""Next month already? They're moving fast. I might try to attend the ceremony.""
[Message 37] Alex: ""Me too. I always like these local events. Makes you feel connected to the community.""
[Message 38] Beth: ""Exactly. It's easy to get caught up in our own little bubbles, but it's important to remember we're all in this together.""
[Message 39] Alex: ""Well said, Beth. We should grab coffee sometime and talk more about…everything!""
[Message 40] Beth: ""I'd like that, Alex. Let's aim for next week?""
[Message 41] Alex: ""Perfect. I’ll pick you up. Same old coffee place?""
[Message 42] Beth: ""Sounds good. And yes, the same place. Can't resist their scones.""
[Message 43] Alex: ""Scones, eh? Maybe I'll try one this time.""
[Message 44] Beth: ""You should! They're delicious. Especially the blueberry ones.""
[Message 45] Alex: ""Blueberry it is then. Alright, I should get going. Got a few things to take care of around the house.""
[Message 46] Beth: ""Okay, have a good day, Alex! And thanks for the heads-up about the park.""
[Message 47] Alex: ""You too, Beth! Talk to you later.""
[Message 48] Beth: ""Bye!""
[Message 49] Alex: ""Hey, did you hear about the art festival next weekend?""
[Message 50] Beth: ""No, tell me more! Where is it?""
[Message 51] Alex: ""It's at the Civic Center Plaza. They're supposed to have all sorts of artists and food vendors.""
[Message 52] Beth: ""That sounds fun! I've been meaning to get out more.""
[Message 53] Alex: ""Me too. Been cooped up too long. Maybe we can check it out together?""
[Message 54] Beth: ""I'd like that! What day were you thinking?""
[Message 55] Alex: ""Saturday? We could go in the afternoon.""
[Message 56] Beth: ""Saturday works perfectly for me. Around 2 pm?""
[Message 57] Alex: ""Sounds good! I’ll text you again on Friday to confirm.""
[Message 58] Beth: ""Great! Looking forward to it.""
[Message 59] Alex: ""Me too! Have you seen any good movies lately?""
[Message 60] Beth: ""Not really. Been too busy with work and writing. Anything you recommend?""
[Message 61] Alex: ""There's that new documentary about Frank Lloyd Wright. I know you're into architecture.""
[Message 62] Beth: ""Oh, that sounds interesting! I'll have to check it out. Thanks!""
[Message 63] Alex: ""No problem! Figured it would be right up your alley.""
[Message 64] Beth: ""You know me too well. By the way, did you ever get that leaky faucet fixed?""
[Message 65] Alex: ""Ugh, don't even remind me. Still haven't gotten around to it. It's on my to-do list though, I swear!""
[Message 66] Beth: ""Procrastination is a powerful force. I understand.""
[Message 67] Alex: ""You're telling me! It’s just… so many other things to do!""
[Message 68] Beth: ""Priorities, priorities. Maybe the art festival will inspire you to be more productive.""
[Message 69] Alex: ""Maybe! Or maybe it will just inspire me to buy more art supplies that I don’t need.""
[Message 70] Beth: ""Haha, I can see that happening. Resist the urge!""
[Message 71] Alex: ""I'll try my best. What are you planning to wear to the festival?""
[Message 72] Beth: ""Hmm, good question. Probably something comfortable and casual. It'll be hot out there.""
[Message 73] Alex: ""Good point. Shorts and a t-shirt for me, I guess.""
[Message 74] Beth: ""Sounds practical. Don't forget sunscreen!""
[Message 75] Alex: ""You're right! Sunscreen is key. Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart.""
[Message 76] Beth: ""Tell me about it. Every ache and pain reminds me of my age.""
[Message 77] Alex: ""Same here. But hey, at least we're still kicking, right?""
[Message 78] Beth: ""Exactly! And we have each other to complain to.""
[Message 79] Alex: ""True that. Misery loves company, or something like that.""
[Message 80] Beth: ""Haha! We're not miserable, just…aware of our mortality.""
[Message 81] Alex: ""Well said! Speaking of which, I need to start thinking about dinner.""
[Message 82] Beth: ""What are you planning to make?""
[Message 83] Alex: ""Thinking of grilling some burgers. Simple and easy.""
[Message 84] Beth: ""Sounds good! I might just order takeout tonight. Feeling lazy.""
[Message 85] Alex: ""Treat yourself! You deserve it after all that spreadsheet wrangling.""
[Message 86] Beth: ""Thanks, Alex! I appreciate that.""
[Message 87] Alex: ""Anytime, Beth. Anything for an old friend.""
[Message 88] Beth: ""You're a good one, Alex.""
[Message 89] Alex: ""I try my best. Alright, I really gotta go. Have a great evening!""
[Message 90] Beth: ""You too, Alex! Talk to you soon.""
[Message 91] Alex: ""See ya!""
[Message 92] Beth: ""One more thing - did you see that hummingbird in my garden yesterday? It was beautiful!""
[Message 93] Alex: ""A hummingbird? Wow, I haven't seen one of those in ages. What color was it?""
[Message 94] Beth: ""It was a Ruby-throated hummingbird. Absolutely stunning.""
[Message 95] Alex: ""I'll have to keep an eye out for them in my garden. I used to have a feeder, maybe I should put it back up.""
[Message 96] Beth: ""You should! They're so fascinating to watch.""
[Message 97] Alex: ""Okay, you've convinced me. Hummingbird feeder, here I come!""
[Message 98] Beth: ""Excellent! You won't regret it.""
[Message 99] Alex: ""Alright, now I REALLY have to go. Bye for real this time!""
[Message 100] Beth: ""Okay, okay! Bye Alex!""
[Message 101] Alex: ""Just remembered… they're having a bake sale at the community center next week!""
[Message 102] Beth: ""A bake sale? Now you're talking my language! When is it?""
[Message 103] Alex: ""It's on Tuesday afternoon. From 2 to 5 pm, I think.""
[Message 104] Beth: ""Hmm, Tuesday afternoon... I might be able to swing by. I love a good bake sale.""
[Message 105] Alex: ""Me too! And it's for a good cause, I think. Something about raising money for the library.""
[Message 106] Beth: ""Even better! I'm a big supporter of the library.""
[Message 107] Alex: ""Me too. Knowledge is power!""
[Message 108] Beth: ""Exactly! Okay, I'm definitely going to try to make it to the bake sale. Thanks for the heads-up!""
[Message 109] Alex: ""No problem! Just spreading the word about important community events. Now, seriously, I'm leaving! Bye!""
[Message 110] Beth: ""Okay, bye! Have a great evening!""
[Message 111] Alex: ""One last thing! The library is having a book drive too...""
[Message 112] Beth: ""A book drive? I have tons of books I could donate! I’ve been meaning to declutter.""
[Message 113] Alex: ""Perfect! Bring them to the community center on Tuesday!""
[Message 114] Beth: ""Will do! This is all great news. Thanks, Alex!""
[Message 115] Alex: ""No problem, Beth! Always happy to share the local happenings. Alright, now I'm REALLY gone! Bye!""
[Message 116] Beth: ""Okay, okay! Bye! Enjoy your burgers!""
[Message 117] Alex: ""Will do! You enjoy your takeout! Bye!""
[Message 118] Beth: ""Bye!""
[Message 119] Alex: ""One final thought! I saw a coyote near the park yesterday…""
[Message 120] Beth: ""A coyote? Really? Be careful walking around there!""
[Message 121] Alex: ""I always am. Just thought you should know, especially if you’re planning on walking your dog there.""
[Message 122] Beth: ""Good point. I don't have a dog, but I'll keep it in mind. Thanks for the warning!""
[Message 123] Alex: ""No problem! Just looking out for you. Okay, NOW I'm leaving! Bye!""
[Message 124] Beth: ""Alright, alright! Bye Alex! I appreciate you!""
[Message 125] Alex: ""Anytime, Beth! See ya!""
[Message 126] Beth: ""Bye!""
[Message 127] Alex: ""Just remembered the farmer's market is this weekend too!""
[Message 128] Beth: ""Oh, I love the farmer's market! Which one?""
[Message 129] Alex: ""The one at Scottsdale Civic Center Mall. Saturday morning.""
[Message 130] Beth: ""Perfect! I'll try to make it. Need to stock up on some fresh produce.""
[Message 131] Alex: ""Me too. Their tomatoes are amazing.""
[Message 132] Beth: ""They are! And the local honey is delicious.""
[Message 133] Alex: ""Definitely. I might pick up some for my tea.""
[Message 134] Beth: ""Good idea! Okay, I'm adding it to my Saturday to-do list. Thanks, Alex!""
[Message 135] Alex: ""No problem, Beth! Just trying to keep you informed. Alright, I'm really leaving now! Bye!""
[Message 136] Beth: ""Okay, bye! Enjoy your evening!""
[Message 137] Alex: ""You too! Talk soon!""
[Message 138] Beth: ""Bye!""
[Message 139] Alex: ""I think I need new glasses.""
[Message 140] Beth: ""Oh, really? Are your eyes getting worse?""
[Message 141] Alex: ""Yeah, I think so. Things are getting blurry, especially when I'm reading.""
[Message 142] Beth: ""That's no fun. You should definitely get them checked out.""
[Message 143] Alex: ""I know, I know. Just haven't gotten around to it. I'll add it to the list.""
[Message 144] Beth: ""Good idea! Eye health is important.""
[Message 145] Alex: ""You're right. I'll call and make an appointment tomorrow. Thanks for the reminder!""
[Message 146] Beth: ""Anytime! Glad I could help. Now, have a great evening! Really!""
[Message 147] Alex: ""You too, Beth! Talk soon! And this time, I mean it! Bye!""
[Message 148] Beth: ""Okay, bye! Get those glasses!""
[Message 149] Alex: ""I will! Bye!""
[Message 150] Beth: ""Bye!""
[Message 151] Alex: ""The sunset is beautiful tonight!""
[Message 152] Beth: ""Oh, I wish I could see it! I'm stuck inside working.""
[Message 153] Alex: ""I'll take a picture and send it to you!""
[Message 154] Beth: ""That would be lovely! Thanks, Alex!""
[Message 155] Alex: ""[Sends a picture of a vibrant Scottsdale sunset]""
[Message 156] Beth: ""Wow, that's gorgeous! Thanks for sharing, Alex! Made my evening.""
[Message 157] Alex: ""You're welcome! Glad I could bring a little sunshine into your office. Okay, bye for real now!""
[Message 158] Beth: ""Okay, bye! Enjoy the rest of the sunset!""
[Message 159] Alex: ""Will do! Bye!""
[Message 160] Beth: ""Bye!""
[Message 161] Alex: ""Did you know they're planting new trees along Scottsdale Road?""
[Message 162] Beth: ""No, I didn't! That's great news. It could definitely use some more greenery.""
[Message 163] Alex: ""Yeah, I agree. They're planting mesquite trees, I think.""
[Message 164] Beth: ""Those are beautiful! Provide good shade too.""
[Message 165] Alex: ""Exactly. Good for the environment and good for the eyes. Okay, bye now!""
[Message 166] Beth: ""Okay, bye! So many local updates!""

[Message 172] Beth: ""Sounds like it will be even more crowded than it already is!""
[Message 173] Alex: ""Probably! But it'll be nice to have more options. Bye!""
[Message 174] Beth: ""True! Bye!""
[Message 175] Alex: ""I need to learn how to bake!""

600,"[Message 1] Alex: Hey everyone, ready to discuss chapter 3 of ""The Fifth Risk"" tonight?

[Message 2] Jamie: Yeah! Just finished rereading it. The stuff about FEMA is pretty wild.

[Message 3] River: Looking forward to it. Made some tea, settling in.

[Message 4] Dakota: Me too. Although, honestly, I'm finding it a bit depressing.

[Message 5] Quinn: Depressing is an understatement, Dakota. Makes you wonder about everything.

[Message 6] Alex: I agree. But also, informative. That's why I wanted to read it.

[Message 7] Jamie: Definitely. Okay, so FEMA...Anyone else feel like it was deliberately crippled?

[Message 8] River: It certainly seems that way, Jamie. The lack of preparedness is shocking.

[Message 9] Dakota: Absolutely. And think about the implications for communities that rely on them.

[Message 10] Quinn: Exactly. It's not just about abstract political failures, it's real people's lives.

[Message 11] Alex: Exactly. That's what resonated with me the most. Anyone remember specific examples that stood out?

[Message 12] Jamie: The section on climate change denial and how it impacts disaster preparedness. That was chilling.

[Message 13] River: Agreed. The deliberate ignorance is terrifying.

[Message 14] Dakota: It's frustrating because there's so much we *could* be doing.

[Message 15] Quinn: It feels like we're actively choosing to be vulnerable.

[Message 16] Alex: Speaking of vulnerable, my neighbor's car got a flat tire this morning. Anyone know a good mechanic?

[Message 17] Jamie: Oh no! Tell them to try Honest Al's on Kingston Pike. They're usually pretty good.

[Message 18] River: Good to know, Jamie! I'll keep that in mind too.

[Message 19] Dakota: Back to the book, though. The part about the Department of Energy was also pretty alarming.

[Message 20] Quinn: Oh yeah, the nuclear waste section? Yikes.

[Message 21] Alex: Right? It's like we're kicking the can down the road for future generations.

[Message 22] Jamie: And they're going to be dealing with the consequences. Not fair at all.

[Message 23] River: It really highlights the importance of long-term thinking and planning.

[Message 24] Dakota: Something our current political climate seems to lack entirely.

[Message 25] Quinn: Preaching to the choir, Dakota. It's all short-term gains and no regard for the future.

[Message 26] Alex: So, what do we do about it? Besides reading depressing books, haha.

[Message 27] Jamie: Well, we vote. And we try to stay informed. Easier said than done, I know.

[Message 28] River: We also need to support organizations that are working on these issues.

[Message 29] Dakota: Agreed. And maybe try to have conversations with people who have different perspectives. Hard, but necessary.

[Message 30] Quinn: That's the real challenge, isn't it? Bridging that divide.

[Message 31] Alex: Definitely. Okay, so next chapter... anyone else feel like it's getting more and more bleak?

[Message 32] Jamie: Oh, absolutely. Prepare for more existential dread.

[Message 33] River: Maybe we need to follow this up with something lighter next month. Any suggestions?

[Message 34] Dakota: Maybe something about gardening? Or cooking? Something practical and positive.

[Message 35] Quinn: I'm in. Anything but another deep dive into governmental dysfunction.

[Message 36] Alex: Gardening sounds great! I've been wanting to try growing tomatoes.

[Message 37] Jamie: Ooh, tomatoes! I can give you some tips. My grandma used to have the best tomato garden.

[Message 38] River: My dad always swore by adding eggshells to the soil. Anyone else heard of that?

[Message 39] Dakota: I've heard that too! It's supposed to add calcium.

[Message 40] Quinn: Huh, interesting. I might have to try that.

[Message 41] Alex: Okay, eggshells it is! We're all going to have amazing tomatoes next summer.

[Message 42] Jamie: Haha, deal! Okay, I should probably head out. Long day tomorrow.

[Message 43] River: Me too. Thanks for the discussion, everyone!

[Message 44] Dakota: Goodnight, all! It was nice to connect. Even if it was about depressing stuff.

[Message 45] Quinn: Night everyone! See you next time.",0,
